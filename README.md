# Usage

Each section of the project can be executed independently. For more detailed instructions, refer to the specific `README.md` files located within their respective directories.

## Running the Complete Pipeline

To run the entire pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Open the `ML4NLP_combined.ipynb` notebook in a Google Colab environment. Connect to a T4 GPU. The free tier of Google Colab is sufficient.

2. Upon executing the first cell, all required files will be automatically downloaded. There is no need for manual setup.

3. When you execute the final cell of the notebook, the pipeline will process a randomly selected product along with its associated reviews.

4. The output files, containing the results, will be saved to the `output/` directory for review.

If any access tokens or files are missing during the process, please let us know so we can address the issue promptly.
