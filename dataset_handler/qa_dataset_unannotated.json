A little goes a really long way for it spreads easily and the texture is very thin yet creamy. So moisturizing but not oily. My skin loves it. It leaves me dewy and has helped my skin look more radiant and clear. I even use it around my eyes sometimes when I don\u2019t feel like doing the whole eye cream thing afterward. It glides so smoothly that it\u2019s perfect for under eye. Try this. You may be surprised. I also use a different brand snail mucin essence which is Devine. Costix I think the brand is.

My huby is from Japan, and we travel there a lot, and the items which came are specialty snacks from partcular regions of Japan, as advertised. It was fun to try the different ones over several days. I think the price is a bit high, but people have to make money and the items are not your standard snacks in grocery stores. But relative to a box of good chocolates which with shipping costs comes to around $100, this is a good deal for Valentines Day or Birthday gifts, and its more fun to try than a box of differnt chocolates.

    "review":"No other options, so... First of all, the darkening is real but will function.  Its what you have to expect considering the adapter has to adjust the entire screen shuttering pattern.<br \/>Now for the backhanded compliment:<br \/>What is REALLY frustrating to me is that Mitsi created an adapter to get their legacy DLPs to function as a 3D device whenever 3D actually arrives.  I'm an adult, and I can't watch CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS more than once.  Then what?  There is no content.  I don't have directTV, so I might consider that.<br \/>However, I have one of the legacy SAMSUNG 3D NOT-SO-READY televisions.  I bought it and was unable to buy the glasses.  I thought it was just out of stock for awhile.  Nope!  Samsung just abandoned their user base and left all of us in the lurch.  Mitsi, in a bold marketing move, specifically blocked the SAMSUNG televisions from being able to use the adapter.<br \/>I'll buy a 3D television one of these days, but not anytime soon.  Even the glasses (just about all of them) will not work with each other.  The universality of the system is still years away.  Think about having DVDs that work with Sony, another for Panasonic, etc.  Once your set dies, you're screwed.<br \/>-NO CONTENT ON CABLE<br \/>-NO INTERCONNECTIVITY<br \/>-NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT<br \/>If I want 3D, I'll take a walk around the block.",

    "review":"The Corkie colorful pepper grinders. I saw these listed, really liked the \"cute\" factor of the multicolored LEDs, and gave them a shot.  Ha!, they really are pretty cute.  The multicolor blinky lights go in sequence around this translucent lip, and yep, there are 4 LEDs to show the grinder's charge level.  I imagine the lights are more a novelty than a necessity, but it's fun to look at, and my cat is fascinated by the lights.  :D<br \/><br \/>The motor seems powerful enough, after loading up with those fancy multicolored peppercorns (black, red, brownish, tan, etc.) to match the festive colors.  Do I need the lights?  No.  Are they fun?  Yeah, why not?  :D<br \/><br \/>Anyway, you can adjust the grind from fine to chunky.  For eggs, I like chunky, to get little bursts of pepper flavor.<br \/><br \/>After charging them with the included usb cables, I got to work.  I tried both \"manual\" and \"automatic\" modes, but the manual doesn't describe how to select them.  It's pretty easy, though.  When pointed upward, turning it on gets the blinkies going and it's in automatic mode.  Tilt it to squeeze out pepper, and it does.  Tilt it back upright, and it turns off.  I haven't timed it, but after a while, it snaps out of automatic mode and turns back off into standby.  For manual mode, just point it down at the food, press to turn on, press to turn off.  Simple!<br \/><br \/>One thing I confess that I like most about them is that the \"output\" is on top and not the bottom.  I hate hate hate when peppermills have the output on the bottom, because it can be placed on a table or countertop that's wet, greasy, dirty, etc., and potentially all that dirt sticks to where the pepper comes out.  The grinders I have now, I have \"coasters\" that they sit in, basically just lids from used jars of peanut-butter and the like (cup-shaped also catches loose pepper).  At least that on these, the output is on top, so it stays clean.  It's frankly the first grinder I have which has that feature.<br \/><br \/>So absolutely, I like these.  :D",

Every toy was at least 20-30% off and my son still plays with them all (I stopped subscribing in January due to the influx in toys due to Christmas).  I highly recommend this!  The toys were so high quality and fun for both of us.",

    "review":"Pleased. So far have only tried the initial subscription box. I was very pleased.  The snacks tended to be of a higher quality and diversity than you get in typical Japanese snack boxes which tend to be mostly kiddie snacks.  It is a bit on the pricey side, but if the shipments continue to be of the quality of the initial shipment, I feel it will be worth the price for the exposure to higher quality and somewhat unique products.  Of course the initial subscriber fee went down AFTER I purchased it, but that's life.  Still feel it is a worthwhile purchase based upon initial impressions.  Also do like the in-box guide\/booklet.<br \/><br \/>Update:  Have been a subscriber for just shy of a year and have to say I have really enjoyed the monthly boxes and plan to continue receiving.  I look forward to seeing what arrives each month.  Though I may not like every item in the package, I have also found some items that I have absolutely loved and have even ordered more of them directly from the company.  I find the price worth it, especially considering the variety, quality, and the exposure to new and interesting items.<br \/><br \/>Update: Dec 2022.  Still a customer and still a fan of the product.  They keep providing interesting products that I enjoy.",

    "review":"mini but mighty. [[VIDEOID:3dfafae1f4988c69ddfb972c41fe2ce6]] This massage gun is mini but mighty! I've gotten the bigger heavy duty ones and while those are very powerful, I've honestly never used past the second or third speed. Those also get a little too heavy for my little hands to hold, especially if using it for more than 5 minutes. This one is just perfect in terms of size and weight. This one is not too bulky and I've brought it with me on a recent weekend getaway - did not take up too much luggage room at all. It has all the attachments that you would need (I usually stick to the round foamy ball). I think this one is perfect for women\/girls, or just anyone that cannot hold anything too heavy but still want the benefits of a massage gun. Don't be mistaken though, just because it is a smaller unit does not mean it isn't powerful! There are four speeds to choose from and at the highest speedy, it packs the same powerful punch as those big massage guns. If this is your first massage gun purchase then I highly recommend getting a smaller one like this first and if you feel like you need a much more heavy duty one then switch to those - I would start with something like this first though.",

    "review":"Unique looking accent light. I'm using this on a bookshelf in a windowless hallway and it does a nice job providing accent light in a location where we don't have an outlet. It's a nice looking lamp made with a unique design and made with solid materials. It's on the heavy side and feels and looks well made. My only complaint about the design is the on\/off touch sensor at the top - it's white plastic and lights up when the light is on which in my opinion disrupts the overall design of the lamp.<br \/><br \/>The lamp doesn't come with much in the way of instructions but I found it intuitive to assemble (screw the top to the base, that's it) and use. Initial charge time is quite long, more than five hours long, so hopefully that translates to long battery life. Keeping the light plugged into an outlet isn't really practical as the charging port is located under the shade of the lamp, not at the base, so a cord would be very visible.<br \/><br \/>The LED color is a soft white and can be dimmed by long pressing the on\/off sensor on the top of the shade. At its highest setting I'd say that the light is still basically and accent light unless you are sitting or working very close to it. I like that I can take this lamp out to the deck for summer entertaining and, assuming it's charged, can be useful during power outages.",

We bought the TV Jan. 2009 and did not realize you had to buy extra emitter and it was not even developed so we have waited almost a year to  get the emitter and then we found out the new  Blue Ray player had to be 3D so that was another $200.00 dollars down the drain. I will not go back to HH Gregg because I was not advised of all the extra you have to have. It was a 73\" Mitsubishi. .

Despite that long time boxed up both plants arrived in great condition.<br \/><br \/>Admittedly a little expensive for two plants but you're technically paying for shipping and curation as with any other subscription box. Will definitely ride it out and get another months box to see what else we get!",
