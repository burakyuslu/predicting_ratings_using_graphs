Its what you have to expect considering the adapter has to adjust the entire screen shuttering pattern.<br />Now for the backhanded compliment:<br />What is REALLY frustrating to me is that Mitsi created an adapter to get their legacy DLPs to function as a 3D device whenever 3D actually arrives.  I'm an adult, and I can't watch CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS more than once.  Then what?  There is no content.  I don't have directTV, so I might consider that.<br />However, I have one of the legacy SAMSUNG 3D NOT-SO-READY televisions.  I bought it and was unable to buy the glasses.  I thought it was just out of stock for awhile.  Nope!  Samsung just abandoned their user base and left all of us in the lurch.  Mitsi, in a bold marketing move, specifically blocked the SAMSUNG televisions from being able to use the adapter.<br />I'll buy a 3D television one of these days, but not anytime soon.  Even the glasses (just about all of them) will not work with each other.  The universality of the system is still years away.  Think about having DVDs that work with Sony, another for Panasonic, etc.  Once your set dies, you're screwed.<br />-NO CONTENT ON CABLE<br />-NO INTERCONNECTIVITY<br />-NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT<br />If I want 3D, I'll take a walk around the block.",

I've gotten the bigger heavy duty ones and while those are very powerful, I've honestly never used past the second or third speed. Those also get a little too heavy for my little hands to hold, especially if using it for more than 5 minutes. This one is just perfect in terms of size and weight. This one is not too bulky and I've brought it with me on a recent weekend getaway - did not take up too much luggage room at all. It has all the attachments that you would need (I usually stick to the round foamy ball). I think this one is perfect for women/girls, or just anyone that cannot hold anything too heavy but still want the benefits of a massage gun. Don't be mistaken though, just because it is a smaller unit does not mean it isn't powerful! There are four speeds to choose from and at the highest speedy, it packs the same powerful punch as those big massage guns. If this is your first massage gun purchase then I highly recommend getting a smaller one like this first and if you feel like you need a much more heavy duty one then switch to those - I would start with something like this first though.",

Initial charge time is quite long, more than five hours long, so hopefully that translates to long battery life. Keeping the light plugged into an outlet isn't really practical as the charging port is located under the shade of the lamp, not at the base, so a cord would be very visible.<br /><br />The LED color is a soft white and can be dimmed by long pressing the on/off sensor on the top of the shade. At its highest setting I'd say that the light is still basically and accent light unless you are sitting or working very close to it.

It's a nice looking lamp made with a unique design and made with solid materials. It's on the heavy side and feels and looks well made. My only complaint about the design is the on/off touch sensor at the top - it's white plastic and lights up when the light is on which in my opinion disrupts the overall design of the lamp.<br /><br />The lamp doesn't come with much in the way of instructions but I found it intuitive to assemble (screw the top to the base, that's it) and use. Initial charge time is quite long, more than five hours long, so hopefully that translates to long battery life. Keeping the light plugged into an outlet isn't really practical as the charging port is located under the shade of the lamp, not at the base, so a cord would be very visible.<br /><br />The LED color is a soft white and can be dimmed by long pressing the on/off sensor on the top of the shade. At its highest setting I'd say that the light is still basically and accent light unless you are sitting or working very close to it. I like that I can take this lamp out to the deck for summer entertaining and, assuming it's charged, can be useful during power outages.",

I bought there was no problem, this is a good company and service was great and it arrived very quick but I wish I had done more  homework before buying the Mitsubishi. Other Types  of TV (Samsung) comes with everything ready to watch 3D. We bought the TV Jan. 2009 and did not realize you had to buy extra emitter and it was not even developed so we have waited almost a year to  get the emitter and then we found out the new  Blue Ray player had to be 3D so that was another $200.00 dollars down the drain. I will not go back to HH Gregg because I was not advised of all the extra you have to have. It was a 73\" Mitsubishi. . Don't buy a TV that has to have an emitter because there is a lot of garbage to hook everything up to get 3D picture.",
