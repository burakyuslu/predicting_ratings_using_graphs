5,B01ANID80C,2016-07-06 10:34:06.000,"Fun and easy to use! This Hair Color Styler Wax is pretty cool stuff.  I am not one to buy and use temporary hair coloring products beause most of them look really fake when applied.  What caught my eye to this product is how it looked on a couple of the sample images shown with light application on this Amazon product page.  The images where it shows the styler wax applied on heavy looks a bit fake and painted on.  When I received this Color Styler, it came in a nice box packaging and the container is a really nice plastic twist top box.  So cool!  Funny that there is no English instructions on the packaging.  Luckily this product is simple and self explanatory.  The wax product is creamy in texture with a pearlescent sheen.  Apply some onto fingers and rub against the palm of hands and onto desired hair strands.  I find that when I applied it heavily into streaks, it looked really fake and Halloween-ish.  The best results is a light dusted effect over dry hair and then follow with hairspray to style and hold.  What is great about this product is that it washes off hands very easily and rinses off hair with one shampoo wash.<br />This is a very special hair wax product that is easy and fun to use.

I stumbled upon this color styler that is a temporary color. Silver ash is the color and I kind of like it. Great for cosplayers or Halloween or even just to go out. It is fun to use and completely fail proof. Comes in a great box so you can use it after you are done with the wax.<br />When I first opened it, I noticed a hint of playdo smell. It felt creamy and was easy to dab on the hair. I say dab because that is what I did, dab it into a part of my hair to turn it silver. I used a comb to work it through the hair so it did not look all clumped up in one spot. It looks pretty good. I can not wait to try a whole section of the hair!

5,B01ANID80C,2017-01-02 18:06:07.000,"Worked great, convincing as part of a costume. This stuff really works, and when applied correctly can give you a distinct grey/silver, or if done lighter a decent salt and pepper (darker hair). I actually used it to fairly convincing effect as Santa in my natural beard. It wasnt &#34;snow white&#34; like the fake santa beards you see out there, but a natural looking grey.  Once set it did not really rub off onto my hands or clothes etc and did not run when getting a little wet.  It was a bit of a struggle to wash out, so wash, rinse and repeat! This is a must-have product for temporary grey in a theater type setting and like i said was convincing while face to face.  I recommend cleaning up any edges of skin with a cotton ball and some rubbing alcohol after applying.<br /><br />The labee and all directions are in Korean or Japanese",All_Beauty

5,B072L84514,2017-06-28 23:00:21.744,💅. It took several cycles to remove all of the polish but still works a lot better than soaking off. It gets hot as well. Overall though I love it!,All_Beauty
4,B072L84514,2018-04-01 18:15:09.824,Works surprisingly good. Works much better than soaking gel nails off.  Still have to leave mine in for about 15 minutes but most of the policy comes off in one piece after that if you work it off with the included tool.  May have to put a few fingers back in for a few minutes but works much better for me than soaking.  Less damage to nails. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is the indicator lights are a little hard to understand.,All_Beauty
4,B072L84514,2018-01-29 17:06:58.597,"It works; just have to find the right balance. I've used several times now and found that this works best for us if we use Gelish Artificial Nail Remover (since we use Gelish structure gel and polishes) to break down the polish.  We do take quite a bit of the top layers off before we steam.  I also put my fingers in on the H (heating setting) so that it does get hot and then switches to the steam setting.  I don't find the temperature to be so hot that I get burned, but I do have to pull my fingers out about 8 minutes in, cool off a second and then right back in.  Oh, I have had the steamer on and gone through the entire H (heating); S (steam) and W (warm) before I turn the machine off and then back on to redo the cycle.  We find this breaks the polish down quicker than if you put your nails in during the steam and warm only.  So, far using the artificial nail remover rather than acetone has not hurt the plastic tray so I believe this will work very, very well for us.  Two of us having been trying to find the best combination and this seems to work best for us.",All_Beauty
5,B072L84514,2017-09-23 14:49:59.241,"Just get it! Amazing! Easy to use and it removed my gel nail polish in 5 minutes without completely drying my nails. And it doesn’t take much acetone either. If you use gel nail polish regularly, I highly recommend this.",All_Beauty
5,B072L84514,2017-06-10 22:12:48.710,"Works surprisingly well. I've seen these steamer machines that are used to remove gel nail polish and while I've always wanted to try them, I was very skeptical and unwilling to spend the money on a gadget that may or may not work. But, removing the gel polish is the worst part or the thing I hate about gel polish: it's time consuming and so hard on the nail bed. I've seen mixed reviews online about gel polish steamers but I finally decided to try one.<br />This gel polish remover machine actually works. It was easy to put together and I was able to completely remove my gel polish in under 20 minutes. First and most important is to file the top layer of gel down first with a nail file before using this device. I was not able to get the gel polish offf without filing the surface first. I put about two capfuls of 100% acetone (you can use less) into the little tray and turned the machine on. Once it beeps, you can stick your fingers inside. It gets a little hot but it's not painful. After five minutes the machine will beep and I am able to scrape off most of the gel polish. I have to do a second round to get certain areas that just won't scrape off. And when I say scrape off, I mean easily scrape off not scraping and hurting the surface of the nail. I guess I should say push off the gel polish to remove it. I leave the remaining acetone in the tray and either reuse it or dump it. I would say this is easier than using aluminum foil or plastic nail caps because you do the whole hand at once. With foil or plastic caps, I never get my whole hand done at once. This was easier and I didn't use any cotton balls and I used less acetone.<br /><br />The device is a little pricey. It's basically a warming plate fitted inside a contained area with holes to place your fingers. It's worth the money to me because I hate the process of gel removal. I  like that the company provides four replacement plastic pieces for the nail holes. It took me a while to figure out what the replacement pieces were for but after reading one of the reviews I now realize what it's used for. There is also a second plastic tray to put the nail polish remover or acetone in. My only criticism is that I wish the device was smaller as I have a lot of nail stuff and this will just add to it all. It's not the fanciest looking device but it does the job.",All_Beauty
5,B072L84514,2018-10-05 05:51:57.909,"Love this polish remover!!!!! I love this polish remover! I have tried several different ways to remove my gel polish. Foil soaks, foil packets, acetone in a bowl placed in hot water.... every method took waaaay to long and was massively inconvenient and awkward. Now I put just a little acetone in this, turn it on and in 5 minutes, my gel polish is ready to rub off. Gets a little hot sometimes, so you need to watch the lights and make sure you don't put your hands in when the light is red. Otherwise, I have absolutely no complaints about this. It came with an extra rubber finger diaphragm and an extra plastic remover dish. So far I've been using this for almost a year and am still using the original diaphragm and dish. I can have my polish off both hands in about 10 minutes. And have suffered a lot less nail bed damage using this then any other method I've tried. Did I say I love this polish remover? Well, I do!",All_Beauty

4,B072L84514,2017-07-05 01:06:32.959,Is not turning on. Update**<br />So seller contacted me like the next day and sent a replacement.<br />Replacement does work. I recommend the seller for the prompt customer service and for the steamer I have to file my nail polish so the steam can weaken it in I can peel it off easily and I believe that different nail polishes are harder than others.  So it took two rounds 10min each per hand.<br />Still faster than my old method.<br />But I'm still ISO the one that peels easier.<br />It also stunk up the whole house so I will now be using it next to the window. Or in the garage with the door open. Lol<br />Those are the nails after 3 - 5 min. I already had a little damage on the ring nail. After the clean up that's the only one that showed the damage still. Lol<br />Third update***<br />Wow this third time I was wearing thick polish and just one whole round of two 5 minutes and a plastic scraper took the polish off I liked it I thought I hated it but now I like it I'm going to use it as now every week.,All_Beauty

I HATED having to put the foil and/or clips on my fingers and wait and wait for them to soak off. This device works much faster and I can USE my hand if I absolutely have to. It seems to be gentler for removal and require less scraping to get the polish off.

Oil free/shine free face.<br />I have extremely oily skin - so if it works for me, I honestly believe it will work for anyone.<br />The reason I am giving it a full five stars despite the fact that it does fall just a tad short of blotting sheets is because of the convenience and discretion! Every damn pack of Clean and Clear wipes cost me 4-5 bucks, and I'd go through a pack in about two weeks. Not to mention, I was embarrassed to use blotting sheets in front of anyone else - at work, etc. - because it's just gross. I don't want everyone seeing the see-through splotch of oil that just came off my face. With this blotting sponge/compact, it just looks like I'm fixing up my makeup!

Great idea to have two sponges for those days im too lazy to wash and dry out the one i was using. This does a great job of removing oil without effecting my makeup. I will have some transfer of powder onto the sponge but that is not unexpected. There is no waste using this and i love that i dont have to worry about having to buy more blotting paper. I find this works better than blotting papers in the sense that the sponge helps blend the makeup that is already on my face. I am not leaving patchy areas where i pressed blotting paper. It sort of freshens up my makeup after wearing it all day if that makes sense. Washing the sponges do not effect their reuse.<br /><br />The only downside i can even think of is that i wish there was some sort of storage for the sponge that is not in use.

I haven't tried this specific scent, but the company sent me a reformulated deodorant in Lemon Martini scent which I assume is similar. Smells great and keeps things dry. I do find I have to reapply after a few hours, but that's expected with natural deodorant and totally worth it to avoid the carcinogens found in chemical-laden products.<br /><br />It's also worth mentioning the company's stellar customer service. I'd had an issue with their old formulation and they sent me two reformulated versions to try (which are great) in a neat little gift package. I've also received handwritten follow-ups since.

4,B01M655RA6,2017-04-08 04:22:17.000,"Great set on a budget with one caveat. This is a great little set of brushes for the price, but there are definitely some things that could be improved here. First, these really do apply foundation (liquid and powder) very well. I've used these with K-Beauty BB creams, stick foundations (Hourglass and FitMe), FitMe and Clinique liquid foundations, and BareMinerals powder foundation. Some of these require a beauty blend-type sponge on top to get a flawless finish, but most do not. I definitely use less product using these brushes, which has a bit of a learning curve - the first couple times I looked like a weirdo with way too much caked on. I mostly use the small round and the medium oval brush. The medium oval I use for foundation and sometimes cream contour/blush. The little round brush is AMAZING for cream shadows, especially ColourPop shadows.<br /><br />These are very easy to clean and I haven't had problems with them shedding fibers after washing. This set comes with a nice little branded cotton bag for storage/travel. My *only* complaint about these is the solidity of the heads and their connection to the handles. Although mine haven't broken (yet) I feel like I have to be really gentle with these. The plastic creeks a bit when you use them and just feels fragile. I've thought about adding something like Sugru to the handles to make them sturdier, but for now they're holding up.",All_Beauty

The handle seems to be a bit weak at the point where the &#34;metal&#34; and black part of the handle come together, making a slight..popping noise. Plastic basically.

The bristles are very soft and they really blend foundation and concealer exceptionally well.

4,B01M655RA6,2017-01-14 03:07:25.000,So soft! Very soft and nice brushes.  Handles do seem a little flimsy if you push really really hard.  But I think they will be fine as I won't be  pushing that hard when using them.  For the price I think they are wonderful.  I used them for the first time today and my makeup went on so smooth and looked so great all day.  I would Def recommend trying them. and I did not get paid to leave this review or get free samples.

5,B01M655RA6,2017-01-05 23:04:49.000,"Beginner set for oval brushes. Ok so I ordered these brushes on January 4th, 2017 I was suppose to get them same day. I didn't. I received an email stating that I would be getting a refund on my shipping cost. I received them today January 5th, 2017. I'll get right into the pros and cons of this product.<br /><br />Pros: super dense brushes, very soft ( feels like velvet), no cracking of the handle ( although I am light handed) amazing with cream foundations and contours, blends very easily ( circular motions not back and forth or else it will take off product), doesn't soak up the product, brushes clean very well, no shedding of the brush on application of cream make up or during cleaning, gives a full coverage with ease, keeps product pigmented, beautiful color and nice grip handle. No frayed hairs.<br /><br />Cons: smaller than other oval brushes, must have a light touch, not the best with liquid foundations.<br /><br />unsurety: not sure on powder application for the biggest brush, the density made it ( for me) take away foundation when lightly buffing on setting powder ( awesome if you are looking for a very natural look). Did well for my bronzer on the second largest brush. The linear brush can pick up a lot of product very quickly and be very pigmented.<br /><br />Overall: 5/5. I think this set is very well worth the price for a beginner to oval brushes. I think it's a good starting set to decide if you like the application of oval brushes and how to get use to them. Was pleasantly surprised at the quality of them for the price. Even though my shipping was not as expected and had to be refunded the product itself makes up for the shipping lapse.",All_Beauty

We bought them for a bachelorette party so we could all match on one of the days out. They were a hit! I was coordinating it so I had my fingers crossed that these would fit/work, and they did very nicely. The bride is a short, tiny gal she ordered a small, I'm about 5'5&#34;, 150 & ordered a medium. I look normally proportioned but always worried about my mamma tummy, but the medium fit fine. One of the girls is a mom of 4 and ordered the XXL. We had it shipped to Tx prime and it took 4 days instead of the normal 2 days. Like I said, all different ladies, some no trouble zones, some all trouble zones, this shirt was a hit. The material was very forgiving, the cut is flowy where it needs to be but more fitted and super feminine too. The material is kinda rough, but that's because it's not cotton clingy which I'm more used to. We walked the streets of Palm Springs and even did a bicycle pub tour in these and nobody had sweat stains (thank God!- We were trying to look cute). Everyone wore it with their favorite cute jeans. Some had flats, I wore flat boots, and couple girls wore them with canvas tennis. Everyone looked nice. You could wear heels and dress this up. The 3/4 sleeve is very cute and was fitted but not too tight. The rose pink is as bright pink as it looks in the ad.

The back is adjustable but the stitching that holds the end strap came undone the first time I wore it. It's still wearable but the straps kind of long and a little hard to tuck into the little pocket. The stitching on the back is the best part (thankfully!) it's pretty clear. You don't even have to be ~that close~ to read it! The cap was a little flat when I got it, and took a little while to mold into the nice rounded shape I like, it's not a very stiff visor so be careful when you're shaping it.<br /><br />Overall it's not a bad hat, I mean I wear baseball/dad hats all the time to get my hair outta my face and it does the job. I don't think it would protect you well from rain but it's more of a fashion statement than a practical hat anyway. After all, I got it to wear around work because I literally only work with guys.

I ordered this one and I like it.<br /><br />My phone is large, a Samsung Galaxy Note 4, and I have a slim case on it.  But because it's large I can't fit the phone, with the case, in the slot they show in the picture but I fit it perfectly in one of the other spots.<br /><br />There are four separate sections to the bag.  There is a pouch in the front that is an empty pouch and has a snap closure.  In the main part that is zippered, there are 3 diffferent sections.  The first has a place for 3 credit/debit/I.D. cards and a plain slot.  In the middle there is another plain slot that has it's own zipper closure. Then there is one more slot that has a place for 3 credit/debit/I.D. cards, a slot, and on the oppposite side a zippered compartment.  So for a small bag there are a lot of compartments!<br /><br />The bag comes with 2 straps.  One is a full strap that is adjustable.  I like to wear bags over my opposite shoulder like a saddlebag and the strap is long enough to do that.  It also comes with a loop strap so that you can use it as a wristlet.  I actually didn't want to lose that strap so I have it attached on the end over the long strap and they both fit.  Because I ordered through a voucher program I did not have a choice of color.  I would have preferred a different color then red but it's okay  - I'll definitely use this!!<br />Belfen Leather Wristlet Wallet Clutch Women",Amazon_Fashion

This is probably because we have heavy ceramic plates that we put on the lower rack.  I looked over the various replacement wheels on Amazon.  They all look basically the same from the different vendors, and they look like the OEM on the dishwasher.  I chose this vendor because I would get 4 instead of 1.<br /><br />Shipping was quick, I think I got them in a few days.  I decided that since I had 4, I would replace all of the wheels on the lower rack instead of just the bad one.  Removal of the originals was easy to do.  Installing the new ones was also very simple - they just snap in place.<br /><br />The reason I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because after installing the new wheels, the lower rack does not roll in/out as easily as it did with the originals.  This was with the rack being empty.  It feels like something is dragging or rubbing and preventing the wheels from rolling smoothly.  I compared the new wheels to the OEM and they look identical.  I left the new wheels on the rack and am keeping the 3 good  OEMs as back up.  Maybe these new wheels need a little breaking in - IDK.",Appliances

3,B0BBPS9YX3,2022-10-31 16:48:22.182,"Upscale and fancy, but not quite a 10. The Normcore Handleless Milk Pitcher aims at being a very upscale milk foaming pitcher.  It kinda is, but I was hoping for more.<br /><br />It does look nice.  The first impression is of a quality item.  The steel seems a bit more hefty than my typical foaming pitcher, and while it looks small in the photos, it's the right size for foaming for one or two drinks.  The sleeve is also cushy and comfy, and does protect extremely well from the heat.<br /><br />There are no volume measurements stamped into it, as there are with the typical 12-oz (which is about the size of this one - the box says 450ml) cheap stainless milk frothing pitcher costing a a bit less than half as much.  Volume measurements can help quite a bit for correct milk drink preparation.  Those less expensive units also have a welded handle, although the silicon sleeve does look much nicer.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the silicon sleeve is partially glued on but wasn't evenly placed - the distance to the bottom varies as you go around.  And, as you can see in the photo with the demitasse and coffee cup, the rubber at the top is separating and the unit is fresh out of the box - never even washed.  I worry that water and crud might get caught in there, but since the sleeve isn't removable, it won't be cleanable.",Appliances

I like this for making lattes in a larger glass, as this pitcher holds a lot more milk than my regular pitcher. The lack of handle makes it easier to manipulate as well, despite this particular size being a bit large for my hand.  Overall, I'm quite pleased with this product.",Appliances

5,B0BBPS9YX3,2022-11-16 00:02:31.307,"Comfortable quality. This is a fantastic 15 ounce milk pitcher.  Instead of a handle, it has a rubber grip around the middle.  This makes it very easy to hold and move around without burning your hands while steaming and pouring the milk.  The mouth is rounded so you get a wider pour when making latte art.<br /><br />I find the size very nice to pour with.  I find that the larger size of this pitcher makes pouring ia bit easier when attempting latte art.  I'd post a picture, but my latte are is not worth sharing.<br /><br />My only issue with this pitcher is that it doesn't have any volume markings on the inside, so you don't know exactly how much milk is in it.  I typically steam 6-7 ounces of milk, so I use a 12 ounce pitcher for steaming, then transfer to this 15 ounce pitcher for pouring.<br /><br />Overall I think this is a great pitcher made from quality materials.<br /><br />The price to value is a bit steep though and there are definitely less expensive options available.

One of the main issues I saw in the reviews is that people are worried about the sleeve, and how to clean it. The sleeve is fully removable. If you're careful enough while pouring your latte art, you would hardly ever need to remove the sleeve to clean it anyhow.<br /><br />The metal feels sturdy, and the sleeve has a nice grip to it.

This one feels very premium and I love the color and finish. I liked the idea of being able to more easily maneuver the pitcher by being able to grip it like a cup.<br /><br />First off, this thing takes some getting used to. The first time I used it I lost some milk and it took me a lot of small tweaks to get the wand positioning right and even then it wasn't really producing the vortex I wanted. Subsequent uses were better, but be prepared for a slight learning curve. I did find I was able to touch the bottom with my one hand to feel the temperature so I was still able to judge the right time to remove it. I wish the padding went up a bit higher to give my hand a little more room. Not a huge deal.<br /><br />My biggest gripe--which is still minor--is that there's no min/max marker on the pitcher (at least, not one I can see). I'm pretty sure max should be the bottom of the spout taper, but I felt like that was maybe a little too much for this particular pitcher.

Finally did it, and I’m loving it!<br /><br />The handle you get from traditional pitchers that come with machines just ends up getting in my way when frothing and when pouring latte art which I had learned to work around, but it still wasn’t ideal. This item completely changed that, which is taking a tiny bit of adjustment but I’m already preferring it.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, my only concern with this pitcher is that the sleeve is glued on which means you can’t slide it off…over time, I could see water potentially deteriorating the glue, but that remains to be seen. So far, it’s not a problem and I love it.<br /><br />I was also worried that the sleeve would be too thin to properly insulate from the heat, but it actually does an excellent job. I feel slight warmth at most, and since it doesn’t cover the bottom and doesn’t go all the way up, I can still use my other hand to judge temperature and when to stop frothing.",Appliances

4,B0BBPS9YX3,2022-12-03 16:32:48.158,"600ml is very wide to grip. I like the handleless style pitchers, since I don't reall like the handle on most pitchers anyway. I was between this 600ml and the smaller 450ml. I have handle versions of both but opted for the 600ml as a way to be able to steam more milk at a time, be a little more versatile. I wish I would have gone with the 450ml though, the 600ml is very wide for my small hands, and a bit too tall for my Gaggia Classic steam wand. I like the feel of the grip though, and the spout is nice.<br />Also if you are wondering if you want the rounded or sharp spout, The Real Sprometheus has a video on it, and the short version is, if you are pouring ""normal"" shapes like hearts and rosettas, opt for the rounded spout.

This is also one of the few pitchers with a beveled top which lets you get the pitcher closer to the coffee surface.

Easy to froth milk with my Breville barista express. Even when milk drips to the side as I’m pouring my milk, it doesn’t get past the rubber sleeve because it’s so tight. But also with the sleeve being so tight, it’s hard to get it off to clean and moreso harder to put it back on easily. The spout is wide and round so it offers a better latte art pouring capability.

I appreciate the uniform black non-stick coating and use this pitcher when making more than 8 Oz of frothed milk.<br /><br />While I love the look and feel of this pitcher, I do miss having measuring graduations in the pitcher. Without them, I have to measure milk separately which isn’t the end of the world, but does leave one more item to wash after making cappuccino. It’s just an extra convenience that would have made this a nearly perfect milk pitcher.<br /><br />The shallow spout allows me to use a cover on the pitcher while frothing, which reduces the spattering milk considerably.

I was able to monitor the temp by touching the bottom of the pitcher, while my fingers holding the pitcher stayed cool. Great looks and great functionality. I do wish they made smaller pitchers as well. Making a 12oz latte, I couldn’t use the bottom of the spout as a gauge for the correct amount of milk. I had to go about 1.5cm below the beginning of the spout. Steaming 10oz of milk in the 450ml pitcher was a bit challenging since the steam wand needed to go deep into the pitcher to get to the surface, then below the surface. Not impossible to do, just uncomfortable. This pitcher would get 6 Stars from me if they’re engraved volume amounts on the inside, to make measurements more precise.

It's just a pitcher....and an awkward expensive one at that.<br /><br />Here's my issues:<br /><br /> 1)  If you think it's going to improve your latter art or make it easier because of better control...it won't.  It's all about practice over time regardless of whether there is a handle or not.<br />2) On a traditional pitcher, most people keep one hand on the handle and the other hand on the side to feel how hot the milk is getting.  The rubber cover forces you to awkwardly hold the side of it with one hand while placing your other hand on the bottom which is the only place you can gauge the temperature by feel.  The downward pressured steam typically heats the bottom of the pitcher first before the rest of it.  You're only feeling localized heat as opposed the average heat of the milk in the pitcher.  You could use a thermometer I suppose but thats just one more piece of junk to clean that really isn't needed once you learn to gauge milk temperature by hand feel.<br />3)  The cover over the pitcher is just one additional place to collect particles.  So you have to disassemble it when you put it in the dishwasher.<br />4)  its 3 times more expensive than a more user friendly practical one.<br /><br />I've you're all about aesthetics at the sacrifice of functionality, then this pitcher is for you.

5,B00XNMDIBU,2023-02-01 13:10:40.728,good basic water filter. This is a good basic carbon filter. It removes the trace chemicals that may be present in the water.  I like the fact that it doesn't break down like other filters i have tried. I take a glass and fill it with ice and let it completely melt. Then I look in the bottom of the glass for fines or particles. These filters don't leave traces like other filters i have used.  The only thing that comes out of these filters is the black soot (carbon) when you first flush the filter after installation.  Flushing is recommended by the manufacturer.,Appliances

It was hard determining if it would work in my refrigerator. I have a Kenmore, and the model listed was very different from my model number. But I went to the Kenmore site and looked at the filter on their own web page. The model number for the filter Kenmore was going to sell me was ADQ36006101, and they wanted $45 for it! Yikes! It turns out these filters are made to replace that particular filter, so I got them.<br /><br />After putting the filter in place, you have to run water through it. It may come out blackish at first, and this is normal even if you bought the filter directly from your refrigerator manufacturer (it did it for me with a totally different brand). Run a quart of water through the system, let it sit for a minute, run another quart through, and repeat this several times. It very quickly comes out clear after the first batch (it's just loose charbon at first).<br /><br />All in all, I'm pleased. I could have spent $45 on a single filter, but I got this three-pack for about half of that.",Appliances

I was planning on attending Bahamas carnival and bought these boots online. My costume is red and gold, but I could only find red and black boots. I went on YouTube and found out about this product.<br /><br />How I did it:<br />1. I started out by using a cotton ball to swab the heels and bottom with the leather preparer and deglazer.<br /><br />2. I then used the colour Flat White for one layer on all surfaces I was painting. I allowed 30 minutes for drying.<br /><br />3. I added 2 layers each surface of the colours Metallic Gold (on the platform and heel) and Fire Red (on the bottom), allowing 30 minutes of drying between layers.<br /><br />4. *****THIS IS WHERE I MESSED UP*****<br />I used a paintbrush (instead of a cotton ball) to attempt to apply the acrylic finisher. When it dried it looked very runny and not at all appealing. So I painted two more layers of Metallic Gold in an attempt to cover that up, which it did for the most part. You can still see if you look closely but no one will be doing that.<br /><br />5. I allowed that to dry for about an hour then applied then I applied the acrylic finisher with a cotton ball on the heel and platform only. I made sure to rub it enough so that there were no parts running.<br /><br />It came out beautifully! And there's so much product left over!",Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

Some other vendors will charge almost as much for a single ring blank which is identical. I have found all of the edges to be very smooth and clean. The only cleanup I have to do is the result of my inlaying and sanding/ polishing.<br /><br />Only thing is that sometimes shipping is super fast and other times might be a week or two.,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing
4,B0BHP56W6K,2022-11-10 06:32:48.283,"Descent Quality. I filled a couple of these with polymer clay. Just stuffed it in and baked as directed by the clay packaging. I then put a Cleo, gloss coating over the baked clay. My son and I each wore one of the rings for a couple of weeks. They held up very well. We both had the same comment, however, the sizing seems a bit off. Before I made the rings, we tried several sizes and chose the ones that best. After wearing them for a while, they just seemed a little bit too big. The next smaller size was too small. We don’t have this issue with any other rings that we own. We don’t have weirdly sized fingers. I think it’s the rings that are strangely sized.",Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing
5,B0BHP56W6K,2022-12-08 09:20:58.364,"Sizing is accurate. The first thing I had to do with these was double check the sizing on my ring mandrel, and it checks out! 100% accurate. They came in individual bags with the size labeled on the outside, which was helpful for a quick-grab. The metal feels very strong, I am not worried about it vanishing or scratching in the near future. It's also very comfortable to wear.

5,B0BHP56W6K,2022-12-18 06:37:57.883,Works with polymer clay. I like the different sizes included in this set. I can make rings for men and women if I want. The rings are very comfortable because the insides are slightly beveled and smooth.<br />I used polymer clay to fill the channel and then put a layer of clay over the top. I think I used too thick a layer though so will use a thinner layer next time. I see a lot of possibilities for decorating these.,Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing
4,B0BHP56W6K,2022-11-25 14:58:33.722,"Nice ring blanks, but they don't have a perfect finish. I've been having a lot of fun playing with these ring blanks and UV resin. It's relatively easy to get a nice looking ring. I found that if you use a lighter layer underneath the color layer, the finished colors seem to pop a little more. For a couple of these I used a layer of white UV resin first, then the color layer.  For others I used a layer of white adhesive backed vinyl. For the one all the on the right hand side in the photos, I just used a layer of holographic vinyl with a clear UV resin on top of it.<br /><br />Using these with UV resin is pretty easy, as long as you keep the moving while you level it out. To do this, I just used a plastic ring mandrel and a small strip that I cut from a silicone mat. By putting the silicone between the ring and the mandrel I was able to keep the ring secure so it wouldn't slide around as I worked. Then I just kept slowly spinning the ring mandrel in my hand as I worked. You'll need to keep it spinning for the first couple minutes while curing as well. Once the resin has started to firm up enough not to drip, you can take it off the mandrel and finish curing it as you would any other UV resin object.<br /><br />These don't have a perfect finish on them. I didn't see it while I was working with them, but when I  was looking at the photos I took I noticed some micro-pitting on the surface of the metal. Since it isn't very noticeable in person, I only took off 1 star for it.",Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

I was a bit disappointed because when I ordered them, I was under the impression that they were regular rings. But that's not the case. These rings are meant to measure finger sizes. It's nice because they have multiple copies of the same size so if you lose one there's a back up. But if these were supposed to be regular rings... run away.

It also cut perfectly in my silhouette machine (put it on the flocked vinyl setting and a double cut and it peals perfectly!).  But I had a horrible time trying to get it to iron on to my daughters shirt.  I had it on the correct temperature settings and gave it the correct time, but it took FOREVER before it would stick on.  And then after a few hours of wear it started to peal off.  I only needed the shirt to last one day so it did its job there, but I think for the future if I get into making more shirts I might invest in a heat press because using an iron just didn't work for me.",Arts_Crafts_and_Sewing

The uniforms did say &#34;do NOT iron&#34;, but I held my breath and did it. As you can see, they turned out perfectly. Even a detailed cut like the Spartan on the skirt turned out wonderfully.

It was a solid sheet of gold glitter and was full of fun sparkle!<br /><br />Cut: I used my cricut - deep blade for this cut. I found it was hard to separate the cut from the rest of sheet even though the cut went all the way through? The adhesive within the sheet must be strong.<br /><br />Iron-on: After following the directions - most of the cut had not adhered to the fabric. After repeating & extending the amount of time it called for in the iron-on directions there was still a some areas that just would not adhere.

They require 24 hours notice to schedule a call back and I've been waiting 4 DAYS!!!<br /><br />2. This stuff WILL NOT STAY STUCK. I have purchased several different colors of this material (and made several different shirts with them) and absolutely none of them stick longer than one hour of wear! I did absolutely everything by the book, 100% cotton pre-washed fabric, ironed on hard surface, etc. and NOTHING WORKS. The material just starts falling off after easy wear. It's terrible that I made my kids birthday shirts for their parties and the crap just started coming off in the middle of BOTH parties. TERRIBLE!!!

5,B0C99HGBJG,2023-03-11 18:04:43.710,"Handy Tire Inflator and Phone Charger. I just received this Powools Cordless Tire Inflator. I selected this brand because we had previously purchased a VacLife cordless portable vacuum from the same parent company. Customer service was outstanding and the vacuum cleaner worked well.<br /><br />The main reason I purchased this charger is due to a slow leak in one of the tires on my Honda Ridgeline truck. I need to pump the tire about once a week. We have a corded tire pump that runs off the cigarette lighter. While effective, it is tedious unwinding and winding the power cord on a weekly basis.<br /><br />I used the cordless inflator to pump all 4 245-60R18 tires on the truck to 35PSI, from around 31 PSI. (The inflator is recommended for a max tire width of 245).  The pump worked well and inflated the tires in about a minute each. I was concerned the unit or air hose may overheat, but the unit had minimal warming and the hose was warm, but not hot to the touch.<br /><br />I then used the inflator to charge my iPhone12 from a 30% battery level to 100%. No issues. The tire inflator unit’s battery level indicator dropped from green (70 to 100% charged) to orange (30 to 70% charged) near the end of charging my iPhone. So, the inflator appears to have decent battery power. The box the tire inflator came in indicates 4-5 times for pumping car tires per inflator battery charge.<br /><br />The cordless tire inflator is charged with a supplied USB cable. The manual indicates full charge in 3-4 hours. It took about 1.5 hours to fully charge my unit when received.<br /><br />Other features of the tire inflator include a decent LED light for inflating at night, an included ball needle and Presta valve adapter (for bikes), a storage bag, real time tire pressure display, preset tire pressure capability, and the previously mentioned inflator battery level indicator.<br /><br />I am pleased with the inflator. I can’t speak for longevity at this time, but since I’ll be using it on a weekly basis, I’ll be able to update the review in the future.",Automotive

5,B082XS76CH,2018-07-22 21:51:29.086,"Product Review - After my first camping trip. Bought this jump starter power bank for a recent camping trip (more for peace of mind)  Fortunately, I didn't have to use unit jump-start my car, but ended up utilizing all other features:<br /><br />Flash Light:<br />- has 3 different modes: normal, strobe and SOS (be sure to hold the power button for a few sec. to turn it on)<br /><br />12V output port:<br />- connected my DC to AC power inverter, which was connected to built-in pump air-matress to keep it inflated.  When kids keep jumping on it, you have constantly put more air in. Most of the times, we had to settle with deflated &amp; wabbly mattress, but this time, we were able to keep this it frim &amp; sturdy.<br /><br />USB port:<br />- It seems like all other products offer this feature, but this is what our family &amp; friends ended up using the most. Without this unit, we would've missed more than half of World Cup. :)<br /><br />After using this power bank for about 14 hrs (on &amp; off), the unit still had 2 solid lights (40% left per instruction manual)<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with this unit, but it would be even better if this unit comes with a bag that can hold both power bank along with all other cables. Original box is nice, but I don't think it will last long.<br /><br />I will continue to use this unit &amp; update the following:<br />1. Charging time. Since the unit was fully charged when purchased, I didn't get a chance to test to see how long it takes to re-charge<br />2. See if the unit can actually jump start my car (I have 2011 Honda Pilot)",Automotive

5,B079PSSCYF,2020-02-26 23:02:56.979,"Handy thing to have. This device is a practical way to tap into a circuit in the fuse box, to power a 12 volt accessory. I used it to tap into the circuit whose fuse is labeled ""RADIO/ACCY"" in the vehicle owner's manual, to power a dashcam and have the ignition switch turn it on and off. The original fuse goes into the slot closest to the blades, and the add-on fuse goes into the slot closest to the wire.  It is important to orient the device so that the end opposite from the wire connects to the +12 volts of the circuit, so that current to the wire has to go through the add-on fuse.<br /><br />In the case of my 2005 Ford Ranger, there was not enough room next to the fuse slot for this device to be oriented the way it should, because the fuses stick out to the side from the device. I had to turn it around so that the fuses are sticking out the other way. The effect of doing that is that current for both the original accessory (radio) and the add-on accessory (dashcam) goes through the original fuse, then current for the add-on accessory goes through the add-on fuse.  For that reason, I replaced the original 10 amp fuse with a 15 amp fuse, to accommodate the extra current, and I inserted a 5 amp fuse into the add-on slot to provide current to the dashcam. So, this fuse tap device can be oriented the right way or the ""wrong"" way and still work.",Automotive

A friend told me about this kind of multi-purpose big battery pack that could also jump cars, and I just had to get one myself.  He had bought it at Costco, but it was little too big for my liking.  Wanted something more compact but with large enough power.  After some search, I finally landed on this one.  Glad I did because it's small enough and powerful enough!<br /><br />Times have changed and (almost) gone are the days where you carry jumping cable and require another car to jump your car!  So convenient!  Another big feature is the battery that could charge phones multiple times.  I charged my iPhone 8 seven times and still have good juice left.  Definitely a big plus when going outdoors like camping.  Flashlight is not as important for me, but it's there and completes it as an emergency battery kit.<br /><br />Jumping cables are just long enough to comfortably attach to the battery.  Phone charging cable's ok, also.<br />Just one thing... I wish it came with a bag to store everything together.  It's not a deal breaker for me as I already have a bag that I keep other tools and things that I keep in my car trunk, but it'd still be nice to have one just in case I need to let someone borrow it.<br /><br />Overall, however, since it's a battery, I'll see how it will perform in about six months and a year+.  The initial experience is great.  We'll see how well it will last.",Automotive

I assume the amount of vibration that the DRZ400 outputs broke the leads. I soldered it back together as a temporary fix, but I've since replaced it with an iJDMTOY relay has a better design.

Looking at the liquid inside the container I knew it wasn't oil but the fuel treatment I ordered. Without me telling Boost Performance about the issue, they sent me a letter of apology with replacement labels and a couple trinkets (a pen and mask). What excellent customer service!<br />My car is an SUV with a 2.0L GDI Turbo motor. Before adding in the treatment , I changed the oil, no reason other than it was needed. I always noticed there was a gas smell in the oil, this is not uncommon for GDI turbo motors to have.  After adding in the treatment  and about 100mile later, I noticed power at part throttle was noticeably  increased and that turbo lag was greatly diminished when stepping on the gas from a stop. I was really surprised that an ounce could do all this. The oil life left after the oil change is now at 92% and usually at about this time it would have this gas smell when checking the dipstick. The gas smell is not nearly as present now. I checked my wife's car with a non GDI/turbo  engine and roughly the same oil life, gas smell is roughly the same! Really surprised at that!  I'm hoping this product will diminish carbon buildup on the valves over time which plagues GDI motors. After what I'm seeing so far , it will. I recommend this product",Automotive

5,B00MEWEFIK,2017-05-20 20:12:07.000,"Great stuff, but have reasonable expectations. So to be clear, here is your expectation management.  It is after all, a fuel additive.  More to my point, I drive a Ford Focus ST and it does 0-60 in six seconds.  A Focus RS will do 0-60 in 4.7 seconds, and costs about 10-12,000 more dollars.  1.4 seconds is a huge deal on a track, but in my mind, not so much for the daily driver I take to work.  I'm just saying, if it costs 10,000 dollar to drop 1.5 seconds off of a 0-60 time, then you have to have reasonable expectations for a fuel additive that costs 1.48 per fill up.  It's not going to make up for the 10,000 you didn't spend on your RS.<br />Anyway, I think this is great stuff.  After filling up the other day, I could feel an immediate difference in the throttle response of my ST.  I also use it in my 97' Ford 350, which is now running smoother and stronger after the last couple fill-ups.

5,B0C99HGBJG,2023-03-29 23:26:05.511,"Convenient and accurate. Recommended. Finally got to use this inflator last night and I am impressed.  But first let's go back to the beginning.  The instructions say to give the battery a full charge.  I plugged the supplied cord into the USB power block I use for my phone and tablet and about 3 hours later the charge light was a nice solid green.  I was ready to go but didn't have anything to inflate.  I spent some time reading the instructions and looking at the accessories.  The inflator includes the standard hose designed for car and bike tires and a needle valve for inflating basket balls, soccer balls, etc.  Very handy.  It also has big display numbers and letters for the operation modes, car, motorcycle, bike, ball or custom as well as pressure displayed in BAR or PSI.  Basically atmospheric pressure and pounds per square inch. The default mode for car and motorcycle tires is BAR, so I did a quick conversion and found the default of 2.4 BAR is right at 35 PSI which is the recommended pressure for my car tires.  You could also use the custom mode which measures in PSI with a range up to 160.  One really nice feature of this inflator is that it displays the current pressure and then shuts itself off when it reaches the pressure you set as your target or default.  Makes inflating a tire a snap.  I used the inflator on one of my car tires.  I hooked it up per the instructions, turned on the inflator and about 2 minutes later the tire was inflated and the tool turned itself off.  Really great and really easy.  BTW, I double checked the pressure with a regular tire gauge and it was right on factory specification.  Simple to use, a convenient carry bag, and small enough to store just about anywhere in the car.  I'm glad I bought it and I would buy it again.",Automotive

5,B00MEWEFIK,2021-06-12 16:39:31.766,"Noticeable difference in fuel efficiency. I purchased a bottle of this stuff in December and it's now the middle of June and I still have plenty left; possibly enough to last enough 4 months or so. I'm pretty consistent, adding this immediately before or as soon after a fill up as possible, for two cars actually. Within the last 6 months I've probably only missed a few fill ups, so that should let you know how long this stuff will last you. I drive a lot too, probably more than the average person, so the value for this product is excellent. I have noticed that on fill ups when I didn't use this, I lost about 2-3 mpg. As far as performance, it's hard to say really. I think my car is pretty quick as it is, so a small difference in power would be hard to notice. However, I think the fuel efficiency improvement is well worth the cost of a bottle. If you break that down as a cost per tank/fill up, it's pretty low. I have a fairly new car and it is well maintained, so I can't say yet how effective it is as keeping this clean inside the engine and what not, but from what I understand from trusted sources, is that it does in fact help reduce carbon build up. So I plan on using this stuff for a long time on both my cars and I think it's worth a shot for...well anyone really. Why NOT get better mpg and keep your engine in good shape?",Automotive

The only things js the angle it faces up so only gets one corner of room but we adjust it underneath with a book or etc so it can tilt for the whole ceiling.

OK it's got way too many flaws, it's going back today.<br /><br />-- The big flaw is that to get it to stop spinning, you have to manually shut off the power switch on the back of the unit, or unplug it. Waste of energy and makes a very small but non-negligible grinding noise constantly unless physically unplugged or physically switched off. You cannot stop the spinning with the remote. Even after it times out after 4 hours and turns off the LEDs and lasers, it's still spinning. LAME LAME LAME<br /><br />-- on the ""LED"" washer light, cannot seem to do a red/green/blue mix: pressing a new color always seems to toggle to the last two<br /><br />-- no way to keep it on indefinitely.<br /><br />-- the ""laser"" star light is (a) green only, (b) does not rotate, and (c) is exceedingly geometrical, it looks like a grid projected on the ceiling.  Not a ""twinkle"" in sight.<br /><br />-- remote is confusing, and of course stomps on control of other LED lights I have, causing them unpredictable behavior while trying to control this light.<br /><br />-- Oh and the ""Fade"" modes do not do a ""cross-fade"": it brings up the blue,  then it completely dims the blue.

4,B07BB3FK19,2019-01-05 12:23:37.449,"I'm 56, on Steroids, and Recently Lost Weight. I'm in my 50s. I have lupus, and prednisone is constantly thinning my skin. Than, last May, I lost my gallbladder and, with it, about 20 pounds thanks to having to completely change my diet and eating habits. My face was beginning to resemble a sharpei.<br /><br />I wasn't ready for that, so I decided to get serious. For me, that meant spending some (for me) serious money on one of those creams with the white board commercials you can't pause or come back to. And it is actually a really good product. But it's five times the cost of this one and doesn't work as well. I also tried the stuff that costs about eleventy billion smackers and works as well as the drug store brand in the blue tin. And then I researched snail mucin and found this. Paid full price, thinking no way could something this inexpensive work.<br /><br />It's better than the infomercial one and way better than the super-expensive stuff. And the price makes it nearly painless to try. For me, it softens my skin and makes it a little thicker and more flexible. It's never going to put the baby fat back in my cheeks, but my neck wattle and jowls are noticeably lessened after about three weeks of using it. After the first week, I stopped using everything else except an inexpensive retinol cream and an HLA serum on the skin around my lips, both once a week. I don't look 30, but my skin has rebounded from the weight loss.<br /><br />Recommend trying this if you've lost weight and want to help your skin rebound.",Beauty_and_Personal_Care

Packaging isn't worth bragging about as mine came in a ziplock style bag with a small tag labeling what the product is. Had I not already bought mango butter in the past I wouldn't know what to expect in terms of scent and texture of the butter. This seller doesn't have any information about their product regarding use, shelf life, or storage.<br /><br />For those who don't know mango butter is a cosmetic product, do not try to use it as a foods item as it isn't made for such uses. This butter can take a bit of time to melt down using the double broiler method. It also takes some time to solidify if left to cool at room temperature. I use mango butter to whip into body/hair butters. I noted that by adding heat to the product and waiting on it to set before whipping takes a while so I just toss everything into a bowl and just whip from there. It does take some time to whip mango butter using a hand blender but it can be done with patience.

It feel's good going on the face and absorbs really fast because it's not super thick.  That's it, once it's absorbed you feel like you put something on your face, but not a moisturizer.  I used this for night time and under makeup.  The foundation I use is dewy and I still have trouble with dryness around my eye's.  This did not relieve that.  The only K Beauty product I've found that truly moisturizes is AHC Ten Revolution eye cream for the face.  Sound like an odd name, but I'm convinced that's my stuff.

I’ve tried several of this line’s products after reading a review in Allure magazine. Cannot rave enough about how great their products are and in my opinion is highly underrated! You will not find a better bang for your buck, nor will you find a better moisturizer for any type of skin! Do yourself a favor and make this apart of your skincare routine!

I’m not saying I wouldn’t use it again, but it can’t be during the freezing winter months. I didn’t have any breakouts while using it so that is a huge plus. My makeup went on nice, unlike other moisturizers that can make it slide around. It is hard to explain, but my face still felt tight and dry after putting it on, even though I didn’t have any dry skin. I just can’t stand the feeling that I don’t feel moisturized. That is probably a personal problem. Lol But it is like when your hands feel dry after washing them, putting on lotion, but they still feel dry, yet no actual dry flaky skin. Mind boggling!

This does come with UV Gel to use for builder or topcoat, and you need a UV light to cure that, but the kit says no nail lamp needed so that is a little misleading.

A little goes a really long way for it spreads easily and the texture is very thin yet creamy. So moisturizing but not oily. My skin loves it. It leaves me dewy and has helped my skin look more radiant and clear. I even use it around my eyes sometimes when I don’t feel like doing the whole eye cream thing afterward. It glides so smoothly that it’s perfect for under eye. Try this. You may be surprised. I also use a different brand snail mucin essence which is Devine. Costix I think the brand is.

I get really bad eczema on my hands and some skincare products irritate it to the point of extreme pain. This night cream doesn’t cause flare ups, but that’s about all it has going for it. It doesn’t make my skin feel any better or worse than generic creams (lightly moisturizing but a little heavy).

Not only is this cream wonderful on my face, it works wonders on dry lips. Feels like silk. I also use it under my eyes. I have tried it on patches of eczema, itches, minor cuts and I can’t believe the things it does. AND the smell is a light orange/tangerine. I never imagined a snail mucin cream would smell so good. I love it. Non-greasy, and disappears into the skin. Skin is just as soft as right after you put it on, in the morning.<br /><br />4/12/19<br />Update: I CANNOT LIVE without this cream! It has changed my skin. I have had violent bouts with eczema my whole life but the worst has been in recent years. I use this cream on my face and within seconds the skin is literally transformed. I will get redness on my face which I believe is a combination of hormonal acne and eczema. It’s gone. I will scratch at the spots on my arms. I take a green tea cloth, wipe the spots gently, spread a tiny bit of snail cream on the spots. They are healing. I open the jar just to smell it sometimes. I use it on my lips and they are like silk. I have put 3 jars on my subscribe and save so that I can take it with me and use it as a hand cream.

I even took a cap from something else to rub it into my pits and it still stayed wet.  I actually, finally, had to take my hair dryer, set it on low and hit both pits for a minute.  So it definitely works but is a pain to get on then.<br /><br />Also one day I used it I did feel a bit sweaty but there was no stink.  Another day I remained dry.  I will keep using to see if it was just my body adjusting to it maybe.  But again - it does work!  Love that it is Vegan and baking-soda free as those are my requirements for deodorant.  Also love what the company stands for and how it is helping people and put planet.<br />If you found my review helpful, why not click the “helpful” button. Thanks!

It’s nice to have products that we can both use. Also, I need to say that I have spent $500 on sets of Arbonne and this stuff works just as good as the expensive stuff or the overpriced stuff you buy in a department store.

I have a lot of different skincare items that I use but I keep going back to this. Whenever I use this, my skin is beautiful, moist and glowing.

5,B07BB3FK19,2021-03-12 03:01:36.996,Pretty good stuff. Yo this stuff is amazing. I’ve been using the Olay face cream for a few months and decided to look for something new when they stopped selling the one I like on Amazon. This cream turned out to be a lot better. It has the consistency of a regular face cream nothing weird ( I thought It’d be weird Cz of the snail component but feels like any cream/lotion). The scent is subtle and great it smells like orange or citrus peels but it’s very light I like it. My skin absorbs it pretty fast and I use it as part of my 10 step Korean skincare routine. My skin feels soft after using it and I like that it gets absorbed quickly so that half of it doesn’t end up on the pillow if you use it at night. I’ve been using it daily for about a month now and my skin feels a lot more moisturized just from adding it to my skincare routine. Overall I think this product is pretty good and you also get a good amount of product for the money like the jar is completely full and holds a lot Cz it doesn’t have a thick edge like most other brands I’ve tried where they try to make it look like it holds a lot when it doesn’t.,Beauty_and_Personal_Care

1,006235065X,2015-10-26 17:31:02.000,"Boring, poorly written ""thriller"" that doesn't thrill at all. This book was not interesting at all - mostly because I found it boring and the characters stilted and unlikable. I was ready for an edge-of-your-seat thriller, and instead I got a sink-into-your-La-Z-Boy-and-fall-asleep story.<br /><br />Protagonist Kit Finn is an interior designer - and apparently a very talented one at that, but when it comes to real life and her personal love life she is a clueless ninny. Determined to have a bold adventure while in Islamorada on business, she has a one-night stand with a man who gives the name of Matt Healy. There was absolutely no chemistry or heat between Kit and Matt. Instead of letting the reader feel the attraction that Kit has for Matt, author Kate White proceeds to describe every detail of what Kit likes about Matt and actually says, &#34;Kit found him attractive.&#34; I'd rather just be shown how they feel, rather than told. If two people are going to fall into bed together right after meeting each other, there should be some serious chemistry going on, and instead it felt clinical. I couldn't figure out what they saw in each other.<br /><br />Since the one-night stand was the plot element that sets everything in motion, I didn't have high hopes for the rest of the novel. I got about 1/4 of the way through the book before I was so bored that I shut it and returned it to the library. I think the book's biggest problem is in its writing. Kate White writes as if she's talking in monotone, B-O-R-I-N-G. It's as if she talks with no inflection and is writing the book as an afterthought, like she was thinking &#34;Oh, let's just throw this in there. Who cares?&#34;<br /><br />I'll stick with Lisa Jackson, Lisa Gardner, Tess Gerritsen, Harlan Coben, and many other top-quality writers to get my mystery/thriller kicks.

It covers everything from basics to advanced techniques with simple descriptions and multiple photographs at different angles. I highly recommend this book as a companion to a BJJ class or something to study when you are in an environment where you can't practice regularly.,Books

I am actually someone who had prior experience in terms of Martial Arts, though I do think in our modern world...it's important to actually know how to defend yourself. You can't bring weapons with you everywhere and what will you do when you might be in a situation where your life or health is in danger? You need to defend yourself. This book gives good reading as well as illustrations to help display points that you might need to use if you find yourself in dangerous situations...male or female this can potentially be a life saver.<br /><br />The book isn't meant to be a substitute for actual peers or instructors, it's to help you retain what you learn in a class. That's a very important thing that people need to know if they decide to buy this. Reading it and practicing the pictures won't make you proficient in the art. You need proper training and discipline to do that. The book simply helps you along your journey, no matter what it may be or to where it will take you.",Books

4,B0875S93MD,2020-05-07 10:29:43.689,"Christine's Horror Fiction Reviews. I admit it freely, when an ARC of a Bentley Little book lands in my lap, there pretty much go any other plans or priorities. Found this one in the mail just as I was leaving for a long day of dental stuff, so I read about 2/3 of it while waiting between one various procedure and another. Finished it up the very next evening.<br /><br />This is classic, undeniable, total Little, right here. Okay, so he’s got a formula … okay, many of the plots are the basic same … but it’s the way he does it, and the way it still just works so dang well every time! He plays upon our acceptance of normalcy, our unwillingness to be rude or difficult or rock the boat, our most basic societal urges to conform and not stand out.<br /><br />Plays upon it, and eventually-but-gradually ratchets it up to absolute insanity. Even the characters who suspect from the start that something’s not quite right get carried along. Like that adage about frogs and boiling water, it’s the slow increase, bit by bit, until it’s too late.<br /><br />As with works such as The Store, The Association, and The Policy, you-the-reader already know how it’s going to go. Involving, obviously, a bank. Most of us already don’t fully understand what they’re up to anyway, all the forms, all the numbers, sign this and authorize that. How much private information do they really have? How much control? Is our money safe? Are our identities safe? What would happen to us if something went wrong?<br /><br />The residents of Montgomery, Arizona are about to learn some terrifying lessons in that regard. When the new First People’s Bank opens – not just opens, but basically appears out of nowhere – it starts spreading its tendrils throughout the town. The bank is eager for customers, offering fantastic deals and incentives.<br /><br />Deals and incentives so precisely tailor-made to each customer’s current needs, or even their hidden secrets, it’s almost sinister. No. Strike the almost. Utterly sinister, in ways that can’t possibly be normal. From would-be homeowners to those burdened by gambling debts, the bank finds ways to ensnare and entangle. To ensure the loyalty of customers and employees alike. To eliminate the competition, so there are no other options.<br /><br />If it follows that familiar formula all the way to the familiar end, well, that’s no surprise either and it doesn’t really matter. By the time you reach the denouement and quick coast to conclusion, you’ve already enjoyed the ride.",Books

4,0425266281,2013-05-07 22:25:58.000,"Even more beautiful than the first volume. When the world is as lush and mystical as Patricia Briggs has created for the Alpha and Omega series, it just begs to be adapted to a visual form.  This graphic novelization (which includes issues 5-8 of the comics) is once again brought to vivid life by David Lawrence, Todd Herman, and Jenny Frison.  It's an excellent team, as this volume, is even more beautiful than the first.<br /><br />While I'm partial to Dan Dos Santos as the artist who creates the novel covers for Patricia Briggs series, as well as the covers for these graphic novel collections, Jenny Frison's issue covers (all included in this volume) are pretty spectacular.  She captures action in a way that makes the wolves feel like they are about to leap off the page.<br /><br />I still view these graphic novels as a compliment to the full novels, but this volume does a pretty impressive job of condensing the plot both through Patty's original dialog, and Todd Herman's deft illustrations. I especially liked how tortured Asil was drawn (great to get to see so much of the character since he crosses over so prominently in FROST BURNED, the most recent Mercy Thompson novel).  This volume is a no brainer for fans of Patricia Briggs, but more than that, it's a real treat for graphic novel fans too",Books

5,006235065X,2015-06-21 22:06:42.000,"page-turning romantic suspense. Despite having a few quibbles with this book, it kept me turning the pages. I hated to put it down. Kit is an interior decorator (some readers may get more decorating stuff than they'd like, but I enjoyed that aspect) who meets a man on a trip which is supposed to be a one night stand - something they both understand. But he ends up inviting her for dinner when they are back in NY and when she gets there, the man (by the same name) is not the man she met earlier. And then bad things begin to happen and the reader is left to figure out who to trust (actually, that wasn't hard) and what is going on (which was the more intriguing question to me). There are three big clues, one in the first chapter (not so much a clue as a &#34;This is a plot gimmick&#34;) and when that is solved, in the very next chapter is the second one. Things happen that you know are going to prove significant, and you know how and why (but the main character doesn't, which is a little annoying but then she doesn't know she's in a suspense novel.)  The third point is actually a clue as to who the bad guy is, and it may be fairly obvious to readers familiar with this type of story. Last quibble, the main character keeps deleting emails without reading them because she's mad and the love interest who is trying to explain to her things aren't what they seem. This always annoys me in books.  Nonetheless, as I said, I found this a fun and riveting book to read especially when you have time to do just that - plane, beach etc. Don't take it on when you only have ten minutes here and there.<br />  Note - The main character keeps telling her clients to pull pages out of shelter magazines to show the kind of interiors they like. It's taken me a week to figure out what a shelter magazine is. (old magazines that one donates to homeless shelters?)  It's a HOUSE magazine or life style magazine. Maybe it's a term of the trade but it drove me nuts. And how easy it would have been for one of her clients to ask - what is a shelter magazine? Her clients included a lot of professional, busy bachelors. Surely they wouldn't know the term, or even read those publications.",Books

I never expected anyone to ever come close to the love I have for him and his talent, let alone take presidence. Bentley Little did. Taking ordinary aspects of every day life and morphing it into nightmares thrills me to no end. 'The Bank' was no different.<br /><br />Most everyone uses a bank of some variety. I do. It's not something we ever really think about until we need a new loan, need to refinance, or get a dress overdraft fee. But, imagine, how much control, how much influence could your bank have over you, your life, your safety?<br /><br />A staple bank of a small, mid-West town suddenly closes. It's not a huge surprise to any of the residents, after all, lots of local businesses have been closing in preference to big box companies and online retailers. What is surprising about it is when the sheriff's department finds the employees of that bank dead, sprawled out in a backwoods clearing. Executed. Every single one of them. Meanwhile, next door to resident-owned used book store, The First People's Bank is announcing their arrival.<br /><br />The story circulates around several perspectives--the used book store owner next door, his wife and teen son, a couple trying to purchase their first home, an employee of the only remaining bank in the area, the local sheriff, a crazy killer in town, an old woman residing in the local retirement home, a city councilman--and the downward spiral is seen from all angles.

I really liked this book, more than I thought I would just based on the synopsis.<br /><br />The pace is brisk, the storytelling interesting and compelling, and the dialogue was authentic. There were so many times I felt like conversations between Baby and Kit were actual real-life conversations friends would have with each other. It also didn't hurt that pop culture references (Star Wars, Angelina Jolie, Pinterest, etc.)<br />were sprinkled throughout the novel.<br /><br />The writing was intelligent and believable. I've read better suspense novels, but for its genre &#34;The Wrong Man&#34; is one of the best I've read.<br /><br />The heroine, Kit Finn was thankfully, neither a Very Special Snowflake, nor a TSTL type of woman. The hero was just shady enough that you were never quite sure whether Kit (or we readers) should fully trust him. That made the story intriguing right up to the end. And even though all the plot points should have come across as over the top, unrealistic or completely contrived, the author did a good job so that I never felt that way. Rather, the explanations and justifications seemed reasonable and believable. That's fairly tricky to pull off, but I felt Kate White did a great of it.<br /><br />All in all, I was not disappointed in this novel. &#34;The Wrong Man&#34; is my first Kate White novel, but surely won't be the last.",Books

4,006235065X,2015-06-28 21:30:33.000,"The Wrong Man by Kate White (thoughts). Summary from Goodreads:<br /><br />&#34;Bold and adventurous in her work as one of Manhattan's hottest interior decorators, Kit Finn couldn't be tamer in her personal life. So, while on vacation in the Florida Keys, Kit resolves to do something risky for once. Flirting with Matt Healy--the rugged stranger she literally bumps into at her hotel--is one thing. Going back to his room after their date is another.<br /><br />Instead, Matt offers to cook her dinner when they're both back in the city. But when Kit arrives at his luxury apartment ready for the date of a lifetime, who is the man who opens the door?<br /><br />Kit's usually so good at reading people. How could she have been taken in by the deceptions of a con man? And why has he targeted her? Piece by piece, Kit realizes that this treachery goes a lot deeper, and gets a lot deadlier. Now the only way out is to expose the vicious puppet master who's turned her life upside-down.&#34;<br /><br />My Thoughts:<br /><br /> I thoroughly enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  This level of enjoyment is what I have come to expect from this author as I have yet to read a book by her that I didn't like.  For me this was the perfect summer thriller that is just meant to be read by the side of a pool in the sunshine.  I can't say that I actually read the book like this (instead I read it on breaks at work and in between innings during my kid's baseball games) but I would have liked to.  It was a page turner that easily sucked me into the storyline and allowed for me to finish this one in a matter of days.  I found that I had a hard time setting it down and often needed to read &#34;just a few more&#34; pages before I could actually put my bookmark in.<br /><br />In this book Kit Finn is a successful interior decorator who has a fling with a stranger that she meets on a business/pleasure trip.  She soon finds out that he isn't the man that she thought he was and finds herself pulled into a dangerous situation that results in murder. While this book wasn't always believable (there were just too many people involved who seemed to want to harm her), it was a really fun read!  This is one of those books that keeps you reading just to see what is going to happen next.  I really, really enjoyed the parts of the book that were about Kit's job as an interior decorator.  It was fun to read about the different ideas that she had for some of her clients.  This wasn't the focus of the book by any means but it really added to the overall reading experience for me.<br /><br />Overall I found myself enjoying this one immensely. I feel like if you are looking for a summer thriller this would fit perfectly with that!  It wasn't a perfect read by any means but for me it was the ease with which I got sucked into this book that made this a real winner.  A page turning thriller is always a good thing!  Easily recommended!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  A thriller that just begs for you to sit and read in one sitting!<br /><br />Disclosure:  I received a copy of this book as part of a TLC book blog tour from the publisher.  Thoughts are my own!",Books

4,006235065X,2015-08-14 10:12:31.000,"Thrilling and edgy psychological suspense! Sometimes we want to believe something so badly that we allow ourselves to be taken advantage of.”<br /><br />---- Aaron B. Powell, an American author<br /><br />Kate White, the New York Times bestselling author, pens her latest suspense novel, The Wrong Man, which is a heart-stopping thriller about an interior decorator who on a business cum pleasure trip to Florida gets conned by a man about his identity, and little did she knew that a simple stolen identity case would land her up in a dangerous game of illegal medicine trading scam which will put her on the hit list.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br /><br />She wanted to be more daring, but one small risk is about to cost her everything­—maybe even her life.<br /><br />Bold and adventurous in her work as owner of one of Manhattan's boutique interior design firms, Kit Finn couldn't be tamer in her personal life. While on vacation in the Florida Keys, Kit resolves to do something risky for once. When she literally bumps into a charming stranger at her hotel, she decides to make good on her promise and act on her attraction.<br /><br />But back in New York, when Kit arrives at his luxury apartment ready to pick up where they left off in the Keys, she doesn't recognize the man standing on the other side of the door.<br /><br />Was this a cruel joke or part of something truly sinister? Kit soon realizes that she's been thrown into a treacherous plot, which is both deeper and deadlier than she could have ever imagined. Now the only way to protect herself, her business, and the people she loves is to find out the true identity of the man who has turned her life upside down.<br /><br />Kit is a thirty-something woman who runs a pretty much small-successful interior decorating business along with her partner, Baby. Kit takes a business trip down to Florida and on the pretext of having no regrets and to let herself loose for a bit, she strikes a friendship with a total random stranger, who gives his name as Matt Healey. After their passionate one night stand, they decide to catch up with one another back in New York, only to find out that Matt Healey is someone different than the Matt Healey with whom Kit had a one night stand. Kit immediately realizes that she had been conned by a stranger. Upon further digging about the weird coincidences and circumstances that left Kit's apartment burglarized to the murder of the real Matt Healey, Kit is sure that the man whom she met in Florida has some agenda to kill Kit. Who is this man?<br /><br />The writing style is brilliant and while reading, I felt like driving down a wild zig-zag styled road the end of which I can't predict by my own. The pacing is really fast and the plot progresses with smooth flow and with an equally engaging narrative style. The suspense and the tension keeps on building as the story begins to move forward. The plot get deepens with mystery when Kit returns back to New York, especially after meeting the real Matt Healey.<br /><br />The mystery is tightly wrapped under layers of brain twisting and jaw dropping events that is unraveled one layer after another. I was sweating with anticipation to find out about the man whom Kit slept with on her trip. Each and every incident is intricately described with proper emotions and vivid and visual imagery to make the readers feel like they are actually a part of this mystery novel.<br /><br />The characters are etched strikingly and are kept closer to reality. Kit is a strong character although at times her panicking about almost slightest of the things annoyed me to the core, still midway through the story, I started rooting for her. The negative characters are firstly layered with lots of positive misdirection and when unraveled, the depth of the darkness underlying their souls were gradually revealed with great vividness.<br /><br />I did not like certain things in the book like there was no point or justification in including the chemistry or inevitable attraction between two main characters of the book, thus putting the book into romantic suspense genre and thus making me lose interest in the story. In a nutshell, its a perfect book for your summer trips to some exotic destination. A paperback of this book is worth every penny, I would say!<br /><br />Verdict: Read it only if you like passionate and romantic thrillers.",Books

I read this book on the recommendation of my favorite author of all time, Mr Stephen King and I've got to be honest this was a very forgettable book. The one thing about Mr Little's writing, and I've read five of his books is at times the uncomfortable reference to ""sex"" and the act of it that's portrayed. At times in several of his books I must confess I skip over most of his ""graphic porn."" The ending of The Bank was almost laughable but I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to find out what was behind it all and wow what a let down.

4,0451231112,2016-10-23 01:38:00.000,"Fun Holiday Read. With Thanksgiving and hosting duties just around the corner, along with the deadline for her latest book, Jessica Fletcher finds herself suffering from a rare case of writer's block. She's also dealing with anonymous letters, which may or may not be threatening, the script for the Thanksgiving pageant, where the amateur actors are her biggest critics, abrasive newcomers to Cabot Cove, who she immediately extends invitations to the main event and an upcoming visit from her beau, the handsome Scotland Yard Inspector George Sutherland. To say Ms. Fletcher is stressed, might be the understatement of the year.<br /><br />But, Jessica is not only a bestselling author and a domestic goddess, she's also one of the most astute detective on television and now in literature. So, when Jessica and George are walking off Thanksgiving dinner and come across a corpse with Doc Hazlitt's very distinctive knife sticking out of it, J.B. knows exactly what to do. She jumps right in and starts unraveling this completely ridiculous mystery.<br /><br />A Fatal Feast is not one of my absolute favorites from the Murder, She Wrote series, but it is a fun holiday read. The plot isn't unique and some of my favorite characters from both the TV and previous books in the series, such as Sheriff Metzger, come across drastically different (and a lot less warm). Still, it's interesting to get a glimpse into Jessica's feelings about George, her future and see her form new relationships, while reinforcing old ones in Cabot Cove. It's also a great escape while the bird cooks!",Books

And I've never written a bad review before either.  I bought this on Kindle because the description made it sound interesting and my past experience has been that 9 times out of 10 the reader reviews are accurate... if there are enough to judge, and to determine that they aren't all paid to review by the publisher, or friends and family of the author.  After this, I won't purchase if there are only 35 reviewers.  I'm not sure what they've been reading lately if the majority of them found this to be a good read.  I found it beyond tedious.  I just wanted it to be over.  I never quit a book until it's done, so I found myself counting the pages.

I also thought the relationship between Kit and her business partner Baby was well developed and realistic.

Snicket's evolving relationship with Moxie Mallahan, the girl sleuth/out-of-work journalist, and his conflicting feelings for Ellington Feint, is politely mentioned but left hanging as he rushes about town, from the library, to a ersatz Education Ministry office that is bundling the town's children to a mysterious Wade Academy,where everyone is drugged out in a laudanum haze.

She's down in Florida on work & some vacation time, when she bumps into a nice looking man, who eventually invites her back to his hotel room. Kit's feeling a bit in a rut & decides to live a bit risky, so she decides to take him up on his offer.  While he's in the bathroom, Kit happens to notice that he has the same pen that her dad gave her, she picks it up to look at it & compare them, when she hears him getting ready to come back into the room. She drops them in her hurried state, but manages to pick them both up, & return his where she saw it, & puts hers back in her purse. They have a nice romantic evening & he tells her he'd like to see her again & it just so happens they both live in NYC  He gives her his name & address & they agree to meet again once they both get back to the city<br /><br />It's now the night when Kit is to meet him again since they both were in Florida & she is excited, getting herself all ready for another nice night of dinner in his apartment. She gets to his apartment when the doorman calls up to let him know she's there. She goes up to the apartment & when the door opens, she sees a different man! She wonders if this is a roommate or who he is & asks him if he's Matt Healey. He says yes, looks a bit confused as to who she is but when she's just as confused, he asks her to have coffee at a nearby coffeehouse to talk & figure out who each other is, & how she got his name & what the other man looked like<br /><br />After this confusing evening she again agrees to meet with this man, talk to his bosses since he's due to fly out of town on business & she briefly sees him before he heads out of town & she stays to talk to his bosses & describe the man she met when in Florida<br /><br />After this meeting is when the bulk of the book takes place. More cat & mouse games , break ins, other crimes & a murder in her own apartment building! She feels it was supposed to be her that they were targeting  since the other woman had same build, hair color, & wearing her trench coat!  The police suspect she might be right & now her business & her are in jeopardy so she temporarily moves in with her co-worker while all this is going on & she doesn't feel safe being in her building<br /><br />It's a good suspense/mystery & many unsavory characters that may or may not play into what's really going on. It's hard for her to know who to trust & not to trust but she sticks around & goes out on a limb to help figure out exactly who wants her & why<br /><br />The book has a great &#34;grab you in&#34; beginning, but after that, although still much suspense it becomes a bit mediocre & even some dry boring areas. Towards the end it picks back up & you really want to read again to find out who is behind everything & how it all ends.

I was expecting wider array of issues.  It is full of examples and letters, but they all - same template, adjusted for the case. Some discipline pretty harsh and unreasonable. Also, structure not straight-forward and if you need verbage for the case, it is hard to find template you need. Book probably would be useful for someone dealing with labor relations or discipline issues, but for front-line manager or HR generalist wouldn't quick reference.",Books

5,0802789358,2009-08-01 03:48:13.000,"We Love Captain Raptor. I picked up Captain Raptor and the Moon Mystery at our local library thinking it might interest our six-year-old son. That was two days ago, and we have now read this book at least ten times, either us reading it to him, or him reading it to himself. He can't get enough of it! And we really don't mind reading it. It is brilliantly written and illustrated in graphic novel/picture book form, able to entertain all of us enough for the frequent readings. Written in the style of the old-time, suspenseful action comics (""Could this be the end of Caption Raptor?"") complete with ""Zap"" and ""Ka-boom"", this book is wildly entertaining and fun for read-aloud time. Captain Raptor, a space dinosaur, is a strong hero figure that the reader loves to root for. Told from the point-of-view of the dinosaurs, who later meet strange aliens (humans), this book is great for teaching perspective, as well as teaching good values - helping one another. I am grateful to O'Malley and O'Brien for creating the dinosaur-science fiction-hero-adventurer-good guy, a brilliant combination that is an obvious hit with many kids. I see there's another Captain Raptor book out there; I plan on buying both and hope this will evolve into a lengthy series so we can enjoy many more Captain Raptor stories. Cleverly written and beautifully illustrated in watercoler and gouache, this book should be a part of every adventure-loving child's library.",Books

It is almost entirely made up of parodies of songs, TV shows and other ilk of that time.  The latest reference is probably about 1962.  While there is some influence from Spike Jones, this man and his cast influenced many more that came after.<br />The selections are uneven, with some very, very good and a few that I had to wonder why they were included.  To me, the very best include the Dragnet bits, the send-up of Lawrence Welk and his viciously accurate attack of Madison Avenue (which I find particularly interesting, considering all the ad work Freberg did).<br />All and all, if you remember calypso music and The Platters, you will enjoy this CD.

5,B000069KGN,2004-06-06 08:20:38.000,"an emphatic Yes. I've never heard the Keys To Ascention CDs. I came across this CD at Circuit City, on sale. I asked a few people at another website about it and they wholeheartedly recommended it to me. I also read the reviews at this site. You were all right. I can't remember the last time I sat and listened to an album four or five times through in one day. I have to say this is a godsend, not just for Yes fans, but for progressive rock fans in general. I won't repeat everything already pointed out about why this album is so good, I will add that there is an economy of production to this CD that isn't present on most modern Yes albums. You actually hear the individual musicians, and that is what makes this album so reminisent of the early '70s output from this band. Not that this album is a rehash of that era, it isn't. This is a collection of mature songs, as well as being focused musically, and not over produced like so much of there '80s and '90s releases.<br />Too bad it wasn't released as an album back when they first recorded these songs, instead of being tacked onto the end of redundant live Yes compilations. Had this CD been released as an album of new songs, it may have been another hit. Instead, its an anomally. Its recieved no promotion. Its very cheesily packaged, with no liner notes, lyrics, or anything (except maybe some poorly chosen pics). Diehard completists already own these songs from KTA, and no radio station will ever buy this CD and introduce these songs to the general public and that's a shame, because these are the first truly worthy collection of songs in the tradition of classic Yes since 1977's Going For The One. Hopefully, we won't have to wait another 20 years for the next one like this.",CDs_and_Vinyl

This is the best collection of their music I've found to date.  BUY THIS!  I will keep looking for their releases on SACD (Enya has one I've seen), K2, DTS, or SHM and I hope the record companies in Japan have some in their future plans.  I listen to just about every type of music.  But sooner or later you want to listen to something soothing and comforting, and CLANNAD is just the band to listen to.  This is a remastered collection which brings out the vocals and layered back-up vocals, plus instrument placement is really great.  A plug here for new stereo equiment...if you do not have a 24/192 DAC CD player--get one.  The difference between and older CD player and the newer ones which seem to release the music to a wider dynamic range is really a huge difference.

5,B004ZBIJE4,2013-09-23 01:42:36.000,"The album far surpasses its radio singles. I've been a big country music fan for the past 5 years or so.  That being said, when I've heard Eric Church songs on the radio, I was never all that impressed, although I thought most of the songs were &#34;good.&#34;  This past summer I had the opportunity of seeing him live in concert, and he put on a really great, energic set.  Because of how engaged the audience was and how he connected with everyone, I decided to give his music another chance.  This time I wanted to go beyond his radio singles and actually listen to the full album.<br /><br />&#34;Chief&#34; really surprised me.  Some of the songs didn't resonate with me at first, such as &#34;Creepin',&#34;  but after listening to every song from start to finish a few times, I realized I was humming or singing along to most of the songs.  One of my biggest gripes with the country music genre is that there are a fair number of extremely cheesy tracks on almost every album.  One of the reasons that I enjoy this Eric Church album so much (the same reason I like Darius Rucker's newest album) is that most of the songs feel geniune, and they aren't very cheesy or cringe-worthy.<br /><br />If you're interested in this album at all, you first have to ask yourself if you like Church's style and voice.  If you're ok with those, then you should definitely give this album a try, you might be surprised by the number of quality songs on here.<br /><br />Standout Tracks: Springsteen, Over When It's Over, Jack Daniels, Homeboy, well...most of the songs honestly.",CDs_and_Vinyl

When I was a freshman attending Northern Arizona University (NAU Flagstaff) in 1966, Dionne Warwick was doing a national tour.  I was thrilled when I discovered she would be doing a concert there.  Two days before the concert, we were hit by an enormous snowstorm, making all roads and railroads impassable.  We were snowbound!.  Came the day of the concert at the gymnasium.  It was packed to the rafters even though we knew there was little chance of her performing.  Then it was announced that Ms. Warwick would be arriving - in a ski plane.  She was nearly an hour late, which mattered to no one and gave us an unforgettable show.  Just before she departed, she said:  &#34;If I get out of here alive, I solemnly swear I will never fly in a ski plane again.&#34;  This collection of her hits is a huge memory maker for me.  There are a few songs missing, but not many.",CDs_and_Vinyl
3,B000069KGN,2002-11-07 03:21:21.000,"90s Studio Material from 'Classic Yes'. Most Yes fans are aware that after 1994's _Talk_, Tony Kaye &amp; Trevor Rabin were gone, and Rick Wakeman &amp; Steve Howe were back.  And that lasted for about a year or so, yielding a three date live stint in California (which would make up the live material on _Keys To Ascenscion 1&amp;2_), as well as these studio recordings.  However managerial issues and scheduling conflicts caused Wakeman to say the hell with it and it truly DID feel like the 70s again with Yes members once again coming and going.<br />&quot;Foot Prints&quot; is kinda a funky, gospelesque Yes for the 90s, with Anderson's typical lyrics that come very, very close to self-parody.  &quot;Be the One&quot; starts off slow and has a weak chorus, but the last few minutes of it are some of the most rocking that Yes have produced in 20 years.  &quot;Mind Drive&quot; has garnered a good reputation from other Yes fans over the past few years, but it is awkwardly put together, the lyrics are silly, and Wakeman's keyboard sounds are stiff.  The best track on the album is the 20-minute &quot;That, That Is&quot; - truly worthy of being called one of Yes' masterpieces.  &quot;Bring Me to the Power&quot; goes on too long, but there are some very nice musical passages in the first four or five minutes.  &quot;Sing Language&quot; is a Howe/Wakeman instrumental that is not very memorable, and &quot;Children of Light&quot; is a folk/hippie song that had its origins in the late 80s and early 90s when Anderson sometimes performed it acoustically.<br />All in all, after listening to these songs, it's easy to see that there was indeed potential for this lineup in the mid 90s had they kept together for an extended period of time, but that was not to be.  Instead, &quot;Classic Yes&quot; produced a set of uneven songs - one excellent one (&quot;That, That Is&quot;), some good ones (&quot;Be the One&quot; &amp; &quot;Bring me to the Power&quot;), and some unstructured and unfocused (&quot;Mind Drive&quot;).  Buy this if you truly have no interest in the live material from _Keys 1 &amp; 2_... but out of all three, your best bet is _Keys to Ascension 1_ which contains great live selections (&quot;Revealing Science of God,&quot; &quot;Starship Trooper,&quot; &quot;Onward&quot;) and two of the better studio tracks - &quot;That, That Is&quot; and &quot;Be the One.&quot;",CDs_and_Vinyl

5,B004ZBIJE4,2011-08-24 18:22:58.000,"Much Better Than Expected! Eric Church has never been shy about breaking the boundaries of country music. He doesn't mind a few odd eclectic instruments, and a really loud guitar. This release shifts him into a whole new gear. This CD is loud, rocking, and very personal. I dont know what I was expecting with this album, but I was apprehensive in light of the interviews Eric did before it's release. He said he was going to shake things up, and really change the style he and his fans were used to. Well, I cant say he was wrong, but if you know Eric's previous releases, you really shouldn't expect anything less than what you get here. The album is a step above the others, but it's without a doubt, 100% Eric Church.<br />From the down-tuned but hard rockin' album opener, Creepin', to the limit pushing radio single Homeboy, and everything in between, Eric shows us that he can be a rock-star and a pure, down home Country singer at the same time. Falshes of Kid Rock and Bruce Springsteen, along with influences of Hank Jr. and George Strait. A perfect mix of loud guitars, deep, dark vocals, and bar-room burners. This album will turn off a lot of neo-traditional country fans, but even as a Strait, Jackson, and LeDoux fan, I'm open minded, and that's what it takes to fall in love with this album. The best Eric Church has offered, and one of the best albums of 2011 so far.",CDs_and_Vinyl

5,B004ZBIJE4,2011-07-26 10:21:48.000,"Perfect country album! ""Chief"" is Eric Church's 3rd studio album and picks up right where he left off with 2009's ""Carolina."" Church is the master at writing country music that rocks, and his music is the epitome of what every country singer should strive for: great songs, good musicianship, and great lyrics that make you want to sing and dance, have fun, or lament over a broken heart. ""Creepin'"" is the album's first track and is aptly named. It starts off from a seemingly far away distance and then creeps into a honky-tonk roar. The arrangement and delivery of the song are as unique as it is fun. ""Drink In My Hand"" can easily become an anthem for any guy looking for a fun night out on the town. ""Keep On"" features some rock and roll guitar licks that will raise the hairs on the back on your neck.  ""Homeboy"" is the first single from the album and tells the story of someone pleading with his brother to turn away from trouble and get his life back on track. The lyrics are deep and meaningful as well as catchy and melodic. ""Springsteen"" amazingly captures the sound of the person it's named after without coming off as a rip off of The Boss' sound.  What sets Church apart from other country singers is his not only his voice, but his passion and delivery. This man sings with passion and you can FEEL it. If you're a fan of this genre of music and haven't listened to Eric Church then you're missing something! Highly recommended!",CDs_and_Vinyl

4,B004ZBIJE4,2011-07-28 21:44:21.000,"Eric Church - Chief. This is definitely, easily, by far the most artistic album put out by Church. From the first sounds of ""Creepin'"" to the abrupt end of ""Over When It's Over"", this is an album that you can listen to from start to finish and the final song works so well to take you back to the beginning. Like all Eric Church albums I either love or hate the tracks selected. There's no in-between. My personal favorites are ""Creepin'"" ""Keep On"" ""Like Jesus Does"" (this needs to be a single), ""Homeboy"", the tongue in cheek ""Country Music Jesus"", ""Springsteen"", and ""Over When It's Over"".  For the die hard Church fans, they will love this album as a whole just like they have before. It's hard to believe that the same guy who put out Chief was put on the Rascal Flatts tour several years ago. His firing was the best thing that could have happened to him. Along with Blake Shelton I believe these two guys will finally move their careers to the next level. They belong up there with Keith Urban and Brad Paisley.",CDs_and_Vinyl

Maybe it's because the artist, Eric Church, has wrote or co-wrote every song on here. True artists, like this great talent (and another example, Toby Keith) usually get a bad rap in Nashville, (I was born & raised here) because they sing their own songs & don't compromise their music. It often makes the climb a little slower, but Hell eventually the cream rises to the top! I personally think it gives their music that raw edginess that is REAL versus the bubblegum commercial pop crap that is pumped out in a continual stream by the so called &#34;Music City Machine&#34; powers that be.

2,B07N9479PQ,2016-11-30 21:28:41.000,"Otterbox, step your game up. I have been a loyal Otterbox customer for years.  Here are the pros and cons of the floral case:<br /><br />Cons<br />1. This case has an overly shiny appearance and scratches easily.<br />2. The plastic is not nice and flush with the phone on the back, so if you set it on its back on a flat surface the phone spins, very annoying. You can see the bulge in the side photo attached.<br />3. For some reason Otterbox created 7 designs of the printed symmetry, and 6 of the 7 are dots or stripes.  Not very creative.<br />4. Case is slippery, they switched their material from a softer matte finish to a gloss finish, not good.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Beautiful design, the floral print is gorgeous.<br />2.

5,B07N9479PQ,2017-06-01 15:56:31.000,"2nd Otter Box (for new model), Love it!!! I had an Otterbox (the hard and soft dual case) for my prior iPhone and dropped my phone more times than I care to admit, but it always emerged as a champ, even if the double cases made it almost as big as a deck of cards... I switched teams and bought a Speck candy case with little rubber grippy stripes on the back for my next phone and was very, very pleased. I wanted to save money on my third phone, but of course Apple moved the camera lens over juuuust enough that the phone looks a little silly with the lens slightly obscured in my Speck case that was designed for another model. Finally, I broke down when Amazon put this on sale [I think it was a Cyber Monday deal?] and I bought it. And kick myself for not buying it sooner! The colors of the flowers are so vibrant and yes, I've dropped my phone a few times and it looks good as new. I've stuffed the phone/case into my purse with keys sharp side out, of course. And the case has protected the back from scratches. I will admit that it can &#34;spin&#34; if put on a flat surface aka could slide a little from its original spot. And if you put it on a slick surface- like the seat of a molded plastic stacking chair- with it non screen side up it can slide to the floor. The case doesn't make the phone bulky and is so snug I had to be sure I wasn't going to snap the actual phone putting it on. (having little otter paws doesn't help). But this is my 2nd Otterbox and I love it! Unless they horribly goof the next model's production I'll continue to be a loyal Otterbox customer.",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories

4,B07N9479PQ,2018-04-02 23:52:20.923,"Good case. But I still like Speck better. I had an OtterBox Commuter on my iPhone 4S, with all the flaps and stuff and it got really dirty and the flaps got flappy and I didn’t like it and went over to Speck and I’ve been there ever since. But after hurling my phone out of my pocket last week and cracking both the case and the glass screen protector but no damage to the phone, I needed a new case so I would have a backup (because I’m accident prone). I looked far and wide but either the cases were $45 or clearly knockoffs, neither of which I wanted, so I decided to look beyond and stumbled on this one.<br /><br />Most of the designs were super preppy and I just couldn’t get into them, or too plain for my spunky taste, but the pink dots was acceptable so I decided to give this a try. It’s a nice case. It has a nice hard backing and a soft lining and it doesn’t have any of the godawful flaps that just drive me bananas. And I can see my peachy Gold iPhone 8 so that’s even better! But I’m not a huge fan of the seam around the outer edge (it seems like the perfect place to harbor germs and bacteria) and I think the sleep/wake button is very hard to press. It’s a good case and I’ll use it until either it dies or I get fed up with it, but it’s not great and I’ll probably go back to Speck after this, because I feel like their cases really are great.",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories

5,B07N9479PQ,2017-06-15 18:18:43.017,"Super cute! Love this case and get tons of compliments on in.  It definitely gets scratched on the back and when you put it on a smooth surface it can slide.  It more so spins because of the way it seems to be weighted.  It doesn't actually slide.  But since there is no rubber element to the case there really isn't any traction for it to stick to a smooth surface.  I attached a couple pictures of the scratches which you can really only see when the light hits it a certain way - but there are a ton.  the other picture is as if you were just looking at it normally and not looking for the scratches.  Overall the case seems to work and looks super cute, so the scratches don't bother me.  One other thing though - this case was SO hard to put on.  I was scared i was going to snap the phone in half.  Now that it is on, I won't take it off because I'm too afraid to, which I guess is good since I do like the case.",Cell_Phones_and_Accessories

I would recommend cutting the flap off with a razor blade in that situation as your connector will stay in 24/7.

I suppose it's a function of the thickness and angle of the vent slats in the particular car and the weight of the phone. But it's better than trying to prop the phone up on its own, and it's much easier to carry around than a suction cup gizmo. So I'd say it was a good purchase, but it's far from perfect.<br /><br />EDIT -- After using the product for less than 2 weeks (I've had it for several months, but I've only used it during two week-long car rentals), it broke.  One of the four claws on the back that hold it to the air vent just broke off.  Very disappointing.  I'm changing my review from 3 stars to 1 because the product is very non-durable.<br /><br />EDIT AGAIN -- I'm adding back a star because of the extraordinary response of the vendor, S360.  Even though the return period on this item had long ago lapsed, the vendor refunded my order and let me know when the item was back in stock so I could order a replacement from them.  They told me that the new stock should be more durable than the original.

The price is a little higher than some competitors, but they guarantee you a fit!<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you look at the multi-ring packs like this one:<br />https://www.amazon.com/ThunderFit-Silicone-Rings-Singles-Wedding/dp/B06WRW8VN5/<br /><br />It's a good savings as most people wind up wanting to try different colors, and you get a lot of value from each pack.",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry

I got these because I currently have a pair of Asics running shoes that are the most comfortable things ever, but not something I could ever wear with jeans. Asics are the best.<br /><br />UPDATE: If you're doing more than 2 miles of walking, I would recommend a better shoe that's made for walking or running.

I bought this for my husband as an anniversary gift - representing the 19th anniversary gift of bronze...while it's not bronze...it was for representation.  We boat all summer long and he does not like to wear his wedding ring for fear it will fall off.  This is the perfect solution (and if it falls off...it can be replaced and it didn't cost a lot!).  He put it on and likes the feel of it and thinks he may even be able to wear it when he golfs.

Not a real hat in the sense. May pass in photos, but not the same in person. Came stuffed in a box, so there was a little damage to the structure/shape. Also, I purchased the yellow one with black belt and the red one fits tighter (I have a small head. Rarely is this a complaint for me.) And the red one appears misshapen, especially around the brim. The yellow one fits better, looks better on. They both appear to be made by the same manufacturer. I'll keep the ones I ordered, but wouldn't order again.

They say you can stretch it a bit, so I would order smaller rather than larger.<br /><br />I found that the rubber surface tended to stick to things rather than slide easily, so putting your hand in your jeans pocket is a little awkward, for example.

There are no complaints as far as design (Mordenmiss is so unique and I own many pieces now.)<br /><br />What is puzzling is the labeling of this product as linen.  Linen is porous.  This fabric is not.  Though China is now producing most of the linen in the world, I think these Amazon designers aren't being completely honest in their fabric descriptions.<br /><br />I could be wrong.  Mordenmiss could be using flax linen in all their products labeled such.  But as with the labeling of &#34;silk&#34; products from China, I feel this is not entirely accurate in almost all cases.<br /><br />Until Amazon can demand some truth in representation here, or the China design industry finds some controls and regulations in it's marketing, I won't be buying any more clothing from Chinese designers labelled as &#34;linen&#34;.",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry

He previously had a qualo band that had gotten a tear and we placed it with this one. This one is a bit taller and thicker than the qualo but that hasnt seemed to bother my husband. I personally like that it doesn't look quite so dainty as the qualo one.,Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry

The pockets are deep, and even though I thought things would easily fall out of them, they don't. The material is a stretch rayon and divine to wear!  The drape of the material is wonderful.

The bra band is extremely tight and constricting, but the part that is supposed to support the back and chest above the bra band is too loose, so that that area bulges even more than it would without the vest.

4,B01AGLJMG0,2022-04-28 20:30:43.665,"Great little bag with a few cons. Very nicely made and detailed for the price; the design is classic, classy and well organized. I love the  handy, almost hidden pockets with magnetic clasps.  However: I like to carry a separate wallet so all the pockets in the front ""organizer"" section are useless for me. (That section is perfect, however, for an iPhone 11 plus a small coin purse that holds my house keys and MetroCard.) But: once I get my wallet into the mail zipped section there isn't room for much else - necessities like a notebook, pen, extra glasses, papers, a small hairbrush, etc. So I usually end up carrying an extra tote along with it. Or carrying it inside a larger tote, which negates the purpose of a crossbody.  NOTE TO THE MANUFACTURER: Could you please make a bag that looks just like this, but an inch larger in each dimension? That would be my dream bag. Thank you.",Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry

But bottom line is that this ring for some reason gave me a bad rash, like eating my skin away... I since then have put on a different silicone ring and I’m all good, until I wear the thunder fit again... so moral is, we all have different skin types, if your skin can tolerate this material, it’s great!

You can layer this under a long jacket.  The models in this company are very small.  Although I am only 5'3&quot; the back part of the top does not come as low on me as it does on the model but it is still good.

5,B003616M2K,2023-03-18 00:46:59.517,"Honestly, I'm Floored. I came to this CD by way of the TV show Yellowstone, in which Kevin Costner stars.  The shows producer, Taylor Sheridan always provides a pretty eclectic soundtrack, often times showcasing songs by the people who perform on the show.<br /><br />During the show one night I heard a song play, one that I'd never heard before, but what caught my attention was the voice.  It seemed like I should know who's voice that was, but I couldn't quite place it.  After researching it I was surprised to learn it was Kevin Costner and HIS band, Modern West, not just some offhand performance with his voice, it was his entire band and obviously I'd managed to somehow miss that fact entirely.<br /><br />So when I started looking for music by Kevin Costner and Modern West, I discovered a variety of Yellowstone soundtracks and then a couple of CD's from Kevin and company.  I decided I would give this one a try and I can honestly say, I was completely surprised at how good this entire album is.  One song after another, the sounds just kept going strong, without a single dud in the bunch.  Starting with the opening track all the way to the final coda, this album is rock solid good.<br /><br />It's not rock and it's not country western, but a combination of of many different genres of music, but they always seem to work perfectly.<br /><br />And that voice.  Who knew Kevin Costner could sing?  Not me.  He uses a lot of vocal inflection to make the songs emote a sense of connection to each track.  His singing is quite good and you get a sense that these songs are speaking to you.  Although Kevin himself didn't write many of these songs, the way he sings them provides a truer sense of who the man is.  He is attached to these songs and then he draws the listener in with the emotion he provides each song.<br /><br />This album might not make my top 10 'on an island' selections, but this gets a lot of rotation around here, the music 'fits' my musical preferences and I'll be listening to it often.",Digital_Music
5,B06XJCDNQW,2021-12-15 01:45:51.504,"Bringing scripture to life. The series originally came out while I was in grade school in the late 80s and early 90s.  My family would listen to them in the car.  I loved them.  I still do!  I learned so many verses by heart from this series.  I think children can identify with the experiences the characters face, and see how scripture really applies to what they go through in their lives.  My ""all-time"" favorite episode was number 4, ""The Great Race of Faith.""  That how I took Romans 8:28 as my life verse.  This series is very impacful.  We had them on cassettes when I was growing up.  I am now middle-aged.  My husband and I haven't had our own children, but are in the process of adoption.

5,B06XJCDNQW,2021-01-19 15:11:38.496,"Fun Bible memory, stories, and music for kids. True, it's on CDs, but we still have a CD drive and windows media player.<br />If you're as old as I am, you would remember when CD's were cutting edge stuff, and most people still had ""cassettes"" with 1/8"" magnetic tape inside.<br />Back in the day, my wife played these tapes for our kids, which have kid adventure stories that result in kids singing scripture verses set to music. They liked them, they learned some good character-building wisdom from the Bible, and now they're having grandchildren. So while the price seems high--who buys a set of 7 CD albums these days--the payoff is incredible. I think the basic plan is to ""release"" the albums one by one over a series of birthdays and Christmases--whatever!<br />So for the wife and daughter who were once said to ""binge out on discipline"" by spending a long car trip learning verses, and the two year old who can sing the whole first verse of ""infant holy"" from memory, even though she can't pronounce ""f"", etc., this is an incredible treat that we were very happy to find.

I LOVE that not only are the songs word-for-word scripture, but the scripture is embedded into a relatable story for kids. These CDs teach scripture AND give meaning to the verses by showing children how they can be applied to every day problems that we face. At age 37, I still will have the songs enter my brain at much-needed times in my own life. I'm expecting the same will happen with my kids.<br /><br />People: I had a question about shipping and contacted the company via Facebook. I received a response immediately.

FAR superior to the original 80s CD release, and is audibly more bracing than the 2009 stereo remaster. If you have heard the Mono box version, then the debate is more than just about the sound, but also encompasses intent. Nevertheless, this is the most aurally gripping of the official releases. Side note: the snippet of Back in the U.S.S.R. on ""Love"" still sounds unique and very appealing; this 2018 remix is NOT that, but rather a shoring up of the original sonics.",Digital_Music

5,B0795YFDYZ,2022-12-28 04:25:54.629,"A more far reaching work of art by Gretzinger?. Perhaps. If you have followed Steffany Gretzinger for years like I have, you do not want to be without this album. Actually, if you’ve never heard of Steffany Gretzinger, you will also definitely want this album in your collection. This work of art went with a refreshing creative direction along with a more mainstream sound that I was aware could have the potential to draw others in who had perhaps not listened to Gretzinger before. Very well written and very well done. SO much more could be said, but I appreciated the very successful attempts at giving listeners a little different offering musically while not leaving the listeners feeling as if they were not served a full course meal. Still very meaty as well as wonderfully melodic with a more modern sensibility. Sometimes a more modern sound twist can leave the listener with a less emotional heart connection, but not the case here. Gretzinger knew she had zero to prove when releasing this artistic musical offering, but I do think she did reveal that no one should be too quick to cram “what she does” in a box. Highly recommend!  (I have zero negative to say about the album itself, but the seller who I purchased from here on Amazon sold me a used CD that was visibly scratched, which was a bummer. I, of course, did receive a quick refund though. Now to try again to locate this album in a CD)!",Digital_Music

I cannot say how disappoited I was when I hooked it up and it did not work. There was nothing wrong with the adaptor, though at the time there was no way to know this. After a week I now have it working and WOW! I contacted Mitsubshi several times and we determined that my set needed to be updated to version 9.03. They send you a flash drive with the update on it. Then it still does not work because no one mentioned that you have to enable the 3d playback in the display settings of PS3.I had all but given up on this adapter when I decided to give it one more try and now am very glad I did. This 3D is awesome. After you watch it for awhile you really do not want to watch standard HD anymore. It is a pain that the adaptor only has one input on it. You have to switch cables between the cable box and PS3. I will probably get a new AV receiver with HDMI 1.4 imputs to solve this. Everyone tells me that I should wait on this because it is still so new. Let me tell you it works really well now and it will be several years before anything comes out that will work a whole lot better. Even then it will be very expensive. So I already had the TV and for about $350.00 I now have a 73"" 3D television. If you have a Mitsubshi set that is 3D ready and about $350.00 to spare don't think twice about it. BUY IT!",Electronics

It looks like something DJI would make, but works like something a fiddler would make. That is because you have to constantly fiddle with it to make it work. Setting it up is like doing magic. Magic that requires years of practice to perfect. It sucks to set up. The instructions are in english. As in the words make sense but the sentences dont. You literally will end up watching every related Youtube video and still barely understand WTF to do. I really never did get it totally. So far I understand that its designed for a 75 gram camera so make sure to buy a scale that measures grams to match your camera to that weight. Once that is done throw it against the wall and break it. Just kidding, but come on. Did I say the instructions suck? Well they do. It finally kind of works but getting it to level the horizon is a female dog. Anyhow once you get it level and start flying around it will occasionally not level out right away, essentially ruining part of the footage. I will keep trying but I were to balance time wasted versus just buying the DJI gimbal, I would have to say I value my time if you know what I mean. So Walkera you should really invest in getting some damn knobs on this thing that dont require using a mirror under your drone to see what you are working on. And maybe actual knobs instead of potentiometers recessed inside of a plastic box and a terrible plastic screwdriver. Just sayin'. Oh maybe a bubble level you can see. Better yet a bubble level built in so it can freaking level itself. Well anyhow I have to make it work until I get a newer drone with an integrated solution. I wont be buying anything else made by Walkera, unless they heavily discount it and are willing to listen to customer complaints. Im not adding any photos, or video.

After buying the 65"" Mitsubishi DLP 3D tv, I thought ""what the h@#$, may as well get the 3d so I can watch 3d Blu Rays, and see what the 3d gaming is like."" As soon as I got it out of the box, I ran into a little bit of a snag with installing it, but only because I use a reciever. After about 20 minutes I had figured it out and I popped in the Demo Disney Blu Ray 3D starter disc and was pretty impressed with the 3D effect. Hopefully more studios produce 3D titles because I woudn't watch any of these disney ones. Then I had no trouble downloading a 3D game on PS3 called Motorstorm 3D. Just when I thought that maybe buying this 3D starter kit was a bit pricy for what it delivered, I had a change of heart. The potential for creating mind blowing games in 3D is incredible. I was hooked on the 3D gaming experience. I suggest getting this starter kit if you are interested in 3D gaming on PS3. The only downside is I absolutely HATE the way the 3D glasses were designed. They fit too tightly on my head and didn't have a natural, more ergonomic feel. Also, at this point, there are like 3 or 4 3D blu ray titles that you can watch, and about 5 games you can download to take advantage of this product.

If I am experiencing this, it just seems to me not a small percentage would.  I will still use it for blockbuster action movies.  It also took me awhile to figure out VUDU & the PS3 store are the only video ""aps"" conducive to 3D.  (Also googled trying to find some input from forums.  A VUDU engineer states doesn't work on XBox.)  I use my PS3 player.  I also have an XBOX, doesn't work on there.  It still works great thru your cable/satellite provider choices, but you have to plug it into your cable box.  (I'm quite certain that is the only way.)  Additionally, I found a website to rent movies [...]  Got my first rental within a couple days.<br /><br />All in all, I am disappointed am not able to immerse myself into the 3D world.  However, it works superbly as far as quality of picture goes.  My TV is 82"".  ""Maybe"" since peripheral vision is allowing eyes to take in not just the TV screen, that could be the cause for the issue with eyes.  I might be able to figure out a fix.  If you can afford this, I'd say give it a shot.  You can always return if have the issues I have experienced.  Good luck!<br /><br />Additionally, if you have digital everything as in phone, internet, TV thru the same box.  You may experience interference in other aspects of your system.  Ie: fax.  I work from home & have an advanced phone set-up.  (Called Avaya.)  My phone worked fine, but my Avaya thru work didn't work via my phone.  I acquired DirecTV right after acquired this.  It works again.  Bright House came out twice & escalated me within customer service, wouldn't work.  Now just my internet & phone is thru Bright House.  I didn't try to fax during this process, but that is something else which could experience interruption from the 3D signal.",Electronics

I have seen many videos on how to power this and some were nightmares but I had an easy fix. The gimbal works well on an X8G with 7.4 volt batteries. I simply took one lead off of my mudder 3 way charging splitter, you get two in a pack, and soldered the lead onto the power side of the gimbal. The battery charging side can fit through the door without drilling and simply plugs in. Easy fix! On an X8G you must replace the camera since the original camera has a proprietary wire to power it. It interferes with the gimbal. A GeekPro or a GoPro camera works well. I hope this helps you in your decision.",Electronics

5,B00MF8012C,2015-07-26 21:08:47.000,"Works well on Phantom 1 after initial struggles and trouble shooting. Setting up the Walkera gimbal on the DJI Phantom 1 was not easy, but I got it done in a few hours. One major complication had nothing to do with the Walkera gimbal. One of the tiny screws on the DJI was locked in so tight that it had to be drilled out, which delayed the project quite a bit.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the top plate has to be reversed to fit on the Phantom. This changes the location of the camera a little, but it still works fine and flies well. The power cable was too short and had to be extended with about 2&#34; of scrap wire which I soldered directly to the DJI aux power wire. I also purchased a 12&#34; servo extension cable at the local hobby store for about $3. It turns out to not be a good fit.  The DJI and the Walkera both use a keyed plug to maintain polarity, and the cable I bought was un-keyed. I had to cut the key off the Walkera cable to make the extension work, and I must be continually mindful that I don't plug it in backwards now.<br /><br />The gimbal functions flawlessly if it is not plugged into the DJI receiver, but you don't have remote control of camera tilt if you don't hook it up to the receiver. It took some research to learn that the tilt control is the first socket on the DJI receiver. I had to go into the software to activate the gimbal and then greatly restrict the travel so it didn't over rotate. Everything eventually worked well on the bench, but it had a terrible vibration during flight. The vibration is caused by an interaction between the autopilot and the gimbal. They start compensating for each other and it bounces the camera quite a bit. Unplugging the tilt control stopped the vibration.<br /><br />There is enough power leaching in on the servo control line to operate the gimbal, so unplugging the power alone will not turn it off.<br /><br />The brains for the gimbal were bouncing up and down.  By design the product would be better if the weight of the brains was on the copter side of the shock mount. The copter compensates so quickly for the changes in load that it kept the bounce going like a yo-yo. The white balls are better springs than shock absorbers. After reading that similar problems were solved by stiffening the balls I decided to dampen the motion of the shock mount. I inserted a scrap of foam rubber between the copter body and the gimbal brain board. This immediately solved the vibration problem.<br /><br />It is also noteworthy that the DJI software seems to connect better the second time it is plugged in. Make sure you are communicating with the drone before trying to edit settings or you will waste a lot of time trying things that have no affect.<br /><br />I recommend tall landing gear.",Electronics

THATS IT! can it be any easier? to enable the 3D mode you go into the menu on the tv, scroll around to the 3d mode and put it on. i'm using it with the PS3 and it is fantastic. i'm telling everyone about this product!<br /><br />the starter pack bluray is a Frisbee or coaster at best. it explains active shutter then has trailers for disney movies they want you to buy (you thought you'd get actual content with this? it's disney! they have to throw product in your faces. the bluray is useful in showing family and friends select scenes when you don't have a bluray in 3d yet though.<br /><br />the glasses fit snugly when you put them on but you really don't feel them after a bit.  I've heard you cannot wear these glasses and see 3D for a prolonged time so i was taking breaks. No problems with motion sickness or what have you.  syncing up the glasses to the adapter with the IR module sometimes is tricky since the glasses go on sleep mode and you need to wake them up.<br /><br />i can't wait to try these out on more movies and games!",Electronics

I set the adapter up in no time and was watching 3D in all formats pretty fast.  Prior to purchasing the starter kit, I had a Panasonic BDP215 setup in checkerboard format which was connected directly to my Mitsubishi 65737 TV.  I was able to watch 3D movies just fine (without the adapter) but I could not upconvert 2D to 3D.  I needed full HD 3D to use all the 3D functions on the Panasonic.  The adapter also allows me to watch 3D movies on demand from my cable company as well as play 3D games on the PS3.  I can also hook up my HTC EVO 3D phone directly to the Panasonic and view 3D pics and video on the tv.  Adapter 3D mode can be changed from Normal to Left/Right to Top/Bottom by a touch of a button on the remote.  Very cool!  I picked up a Kinovo 501 3D capable switcher (with remote) and plugged that into the adapter since there is only 1 HDMI IN on the adapter itself.  The switcher works flawlessly...highly recommended with this setup.  The XPAND glasses and emitter work just fine with the adapter (I plugged the emitter cable directly into the tv, not the adapter).  There are a few kinks to work out (some cable box video signal degradation, glasses lost sync but only a few times) but overall, I couldn't ask for much more in terms of flexibility and functionality.",Electronics

5,B003KTN0B4,2010-12-21 11:16:31.000,"Mitsubishi are the 3D kings. Let me first say that I have 3 3D TV's. I have a 73"" Mitsubishi DLP and a 55"" Samsung LED. The Samsung TV wins in terms of motion and sharpness, but 3D? Forget about it...the Mitsubishi destroys it. I don't know why, but DLP just mops up the floor with the competition when it comes to 3D. I don't know if it's the ridiculous size, the checkerboard 3D method, or what, but I don't even watch 3D on my Samsung anymore.<br /><br />Now, this kit comes with 2 pairs of glasses, the 3D emitter, and a Disney sampler Blu-ray. The emitter is a box that plugs into a special port on your Mitsubishi TV and controls the lens swapping of your 3D glasses. This emitter is built into the Samsung 3D TV's, but for some reason it's NOT built into the Mitsubishi's. Probably to keep the cost low for people who want these TV's but don't care about 3D. The box is easy to hook up. It hooks into the back of your TV and then it must also be plugged into a wall outlet. It comes with a remote, but i just leave mine on at all times. I don't think it will overheat. There's a red light on the unit which your glasses must be able to see. I've run into no incidents of the glasses not working, even when swapping them between people and moving around the room. Also, my rechargable Samsung 3D glasses work on it, too, so that's a bonus. The quality is the same. (the Mitsubishi glasses in this box are not rechargable. They use the kind of batteries you find in a watch).<br /><br />The Disney sampler disc is filled with trailers for 3D Blu rays from Disney, such as A Christmas Carol and Alice in Wonderland. There's not a lot of content on the disc, but Disney is doing a good job with their 3D, so it's a good showcase for your 3D TV.<br /><br />If you're looking for the cream of the 3D crop, check out IMAX Under the Sea, A christmas Carol, and IMAX Space Station. I've found those to be the absolute best 3D Blu Rays you can get. Alice in Wonderland is ok, but it's a bit unbalanced and some of the CG + live action stuff was not composited very well. Films like Monster House and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs don't look great. When it comes to 3D, live action is always the best, because of the textures. When you have textures which are a lot of solid colors (as you get with animated films), you end up with ghosting...Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, which is very cartoonish, has a TON of ghosting. A Christmas Carol, which was made to look photorealistic - does not. It looks great. So make sure you pick up live action films, or at least ones that try to look live action, since they look the best in 3D. Oh, and stay away from Clash of the Titans in 3D! It was post-processed, and was NOT filmed in 3D and it just looks ridiculous!",Electronics

Walkera should pay the youtubers for the training videos they do to teach how to install this.  Particular attention should be paid to reversing the mount so you don't hang too far out front.

I have a Panasonic 3D Blu-Ray player and set it up according to the directions but it was very hit or miss if a given movie would play.<br /><br />The problem was that the adapter (little black box that you made all the connections to) would convert Full 3D signals to the checkerboard that the TV (WD-65833 manufactured in August 2007) required.  My Panasonic blu-ray player can output checkerboard so the solution that Mitsubishi doesn't ever cover in it's directions, is to:<br /><br />1. hook the emitter to the tv<br />2. set the panasonic blu-ray player to output checkerboard<br />3. set the HDMI input you are using from the blu-ray player to FX Gaming (WD-xx833 series only)<br />4. toss the 3D adapter in the junk pile - you don't need it with the Panasonic player set to checkerboard<br /><br />Once I got rid of the adapter it worked great.<br /><br />If you have some other Blu-Ray player that doesn't support checkerboard then these directions probably won't help you.",Electronics

PLEASE TAKE NOTE: there is only (1) HDMI in and out. If you have 3D supported Cable/Satellite Service and have a 3D Blu-Ray player you will need to purchase a switch that will support the 1.4 HDMI 3D content.

Which basically means their name/brand carry enormous weight and clout that has afforded them a nice cushy spot as the leading source in pre-paid cards. Brand monoply allows for VISA something they otherwise could not afford to do because there are no other alternatives for us the consumer. There mindset is,  “We don’t have to do anything but supply a card upon purchase...it doesn’t need to be dependable or reliable because we don’t have competiting brands that can match our years of branding and global recognition so we don’t really need to work too hard or break a sweat in providing quality service for our pre-paid cards...our integrity is competition based which means the less competition, less focus on ethics and integrity and more capitalization on being the monopoly!”<br /><br />Unfortunately folks it’s a win win for VISA and crap shoot for us....so be cautious and aware of the game!...",Gift_Cards

I was able to get gas (pay in store) I got a pin and it worked as a debit as well as credit. It had the full value and it worked at stores as well as online. As expected I couldn't use it for my automatic bill pay but it did work with App purchases. You can check the balance online and call and I will say it's slightly delayed by maybe an hour or so for some transactions but if you keep track it's accurate. No ATM use however I didn't try it with a pin less debit option they have on some machines. Some merchants require the chip now so that may be a con for some but it's a giftcard not like a prepaid card so it wasn't a problem for me.,Gift_Cards

With all of the chaos and trauma associated with the hospital visits, getting meals together for a family of 4 can be overwhelming.  People who live close to them can drop food off in person. I live too far away for that, but wanted to help them with meals.  Buying this GrubHub card and mailing it to them was the best option I had to help out.  I'm not into Venmo or even PayPal, so having the gift card sent to me first made it easier for me to show my support.

I recently notice amazon offered visa giftcards.<br />As christmas approach, I had no time to go to actual stores for christmas shopping. I decided to do everything online. At first, I saw all these good reviews, soo I went ahead and purchased 1 card.. As I considered buying another one, I clicked on the review page, where I saw all the negative reviews it has. I was a bit worry. And I hold off buying anymore. But it worked out great. Two days after, I contacted my relative. I offered to switch it. They were baffled lol. They had already spent it on a purchase online:) And all this about registering the card wasn't needed. I ordered the card on Dec.23, 2022 before 9am. It shipped an arrived at my home by 7pm on the same day! I will be ordering another one soon.<br />I say its fine. I will take a chance on it again.<br />I say limit 2 per order. To be on the safe side. I saw alot of negative reviews on activation issues on multiples in one order. Overall I am please. Hopes this helps too...<br /><br />Update**I just purchased another one. It came overnight.  Since the holidays and times are rough with these inflations. I wanted to see If I can pay my tmobile bill of $100 due in 2 days as an emergency/buys me sometime till next payday.  I do have 4 pay with amazon like: Sezzle/Afterpay/Paypal 4 pay platforms that come in handy. I only pay %25 down.<br />which was $26.50.<br />I did have to registered the card. I was a bit worry based on reviews. But it worked out fine. Automarically it showed me $100 balance. I went to my T-mobile account.<br />I initially paid $95.00 incase T-mobile it holds $3 for payment.. But i tried it 2nd time $5.00 it went through as well:) It worked out excellent. No need to put less $100. I do say if you registered it.. use it ASAP.. if not hold on to be on the safe side..based on reviews about the website being hacked. But soo far 2 cards worked excellent for me:)",Gift_Cards

I'm trying to help my 72 year old mom save some money since she's on a fixed income but still thinks money grows on trees. She is not tech savvy and hates change, especially when it comes to anything that involves a computer, TV, cell phone, etc. (she still owns and uses a VHS player). I purchased her a Roku and decided to get her this Netflix gift card so she could see if this was something she could possibly use to cut down her cable costs without making any long-term commitment. I helped her set everything up (okay, I set everything up), showed her how simple it was to use, the HUGE variety of shows Netflix offers AND no commercials. Well, this might be the best purchase I've ever made for her. She loves it and is obsessed with Netflix! It frees up some additional time for me because she's 'too busy watching her shows' to need me to come over and help with her 87 projects. Win win! Using the card was easy - no problems and new subscribers still get their first month free! She's already had me add her debit card so when the gift card runs out, she'll still have all of 'her shows'.",Gift_Cards

I had that happen with the Starbucks ones at least.<br /><br />It's a medium roast, not bitter, with a bold taste similar to diner coffee. Since it is cold brew, there is no risk of that harshness that sometimes comes from scorching the beans. This allows the pure coffee taste to come through unhindered.<br /><br />Pour over ice or over hot water. Never add hot water to cold coffee -- for the liquids, always work from hottest to coldest.

The double packs are Impossible to stir. I had to dump it in my food processor to mix it, then scoop it all back into the jar. I went back to the single purchase jars - no problems mixing. Strange (???) Anyway, I recommend purchasing the single jars not the double pack jars.<br />This is, by far, hands down, the BEST almond butter on the market. No added oil, sugar, easy to stir & maintains consistency. Some other brands have too much oil or is pasty hard near the bottom of the jar.<br />I am so glad I tried Almondee!

Really added fantastic flavor to the meat. Simple to use and a little goes a long way. I do love the taste of onions so I will be adding this to plenty of meals in the future. Love that there is only five ingredients.,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food
3,B07DH7VCYX,2018-07-18 13:48:29.612,"Price makes this a tough sell for cold brew regulars.  Not bad for vacation. I haven't drank a lot of chicory filled coffee, but the flavor seems spot on.  The price is a bit rough.  The smaller sized packets may be great for occasional drinkers, but I had to use the whole tin to fill part of my giant coffee vat, which I usually fill with a (12oz or so) bag of coffee.  That bag of coffee can cost $5-10, but this is twice that.  Of course that coffee needs to be ground (many stores will let you do that) and I need to put it in a cold brew brewer, but the cost savings can buy a lot of coffee kit.<br /><br />I could see this used on vacation (throw these in a bag and brew on site with whatever is there.  The smaller size and lack of needing a proper cold brew setup could make this a viable scenario.",Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

3,B07DH7VCYX,2018-07-08 00:53:26.822,"I preferred the County Line Kitchen Cold Brew Coffee system over Grady's Cold Brew Coffee. I was really looking forward to trying this out when I ordered it. I've been using a [[ASIN:B01ATJ6AJG Cold Brew Coffee Maker - 2 Quart - Make Amazing Cold Brew Coffee and Tea with This Durable Mason Jar with Stainless Steel Filter and Stainless Steel Lid]] for about 2 years now and I wanted to know if Grady's would be any better.<br /><br />Well, in my humble opinion, Grady's is not better. The reasons why are as follows:<br /><br />Grady's is a little more difficult to measure to get the &#34;right&#34; volume for a cup of coffee. You see, Grady's instructs you to immerse one &#34;packet&#34; of coffee, very carefully, into a pitcher of water containing 2-cups of water overnight or for at least 12 hours. Yes, Grady's feels you'll need an entire pitcher for just 2-cups of water. However, when I opened the canister and very carefully removed 1 packet of coffee I was quite surprised because the packet of coffee is very large when only brewing with 2-cups of water.<br /><br />Sure enough, the coffee came out quite dark after brewing overnight. So dark, in fact, that it was doing it's best to stain my trusty white coffee mug. Again, Grady's wants you to practice your arithmetic here and make sure that you've measured the proportions/ratios correctly. So, you are supposed to brew one packet of Grady's in 2-cups of ice-cold filtered water overnight or for 12-hours. (check). Then you are supposed to remove the coffee packet from the pitcher very carefully and enjoy the concentrated mix for the week. Well, by my calculations, 2-cups of water divided by 3 = .67 or 2/3 cup of coffee to which you are supposed to then add an equal part of water or milk and pour over ice for delicious &#34;iced coffee.&#34; This is supposed to &#34;cold-brew&#34; coffee but I see that you can have your cold brew coffee over ice if you like, especially if you want to thin out this super concentrated concoction. I took Grady's advice but I added another equal part of the ice to go with the equal part of water (or milk) that I added to the original 1/2 cup of coffee.<br /><br />Whoa! Waitt a second! What happened to the 2/3 cup of coffee? Ha! Some of that water from the original 2-cups I used to brew with the coffee packet stayed in the coffee packet despite my attempts to very carefully extract all the fluid from the packet. Therefore, I was left with only a cup and half total from brewing the night before. Although I diluted the mixture more than instructed by Grady's (I actually had to figure out the ratios all on my own. Thanks Grady's!) I still had a cup of very dark coffee diluted with 1/2 cup of milk & a 1/2 of water in the form of an ice cube (I placed all 3 parts in a Blender and combined them).<br /><br />When I saw what the iced coffee/cold brew coffee mixture was doing to my coffee mug, I could only imagine what it was doing to my teeth. I don't think the coffee was &#34;great&#34; either. It definitely wasn't &#34;bad,&#34; but it isn't something I'd go out of my way to make again. In my opinion, the [[ASIN:B01ATJ6AJG Cold Brew Coffee Maker - 2 Quart - Make Amazing Cold Brew Coffee and Tea with This Durable Mason Jar with Stainless Steel Filter and Stainless Steel Lid]] is a much easier system to work with and it offers you, the end user, more control. You can choose the beans you'll use and you can choose how strong, or light, you'd like the mixture to be based on how long you brew the coffee or what kind of coffee you use or both.<br /><br />I did enjoy trying a different brand of cold-brew coffee but, in the end, I'm going to stick with the [[ASIN:B01ATJ6AJG Cold Brew Coffee Maker - 2 Quart - Make Amazing Cold Brew Coffee and Tea with This Durable Mason Jar with Stainless Steel Filter and Stainless Steel Lid]] that I prefer over the Grady's cold brew system.",Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

Smells GREAT when you open it up.  Directions are simple and in 12 hours you can have your own tasty cold brew ready to go.  My only &#34;complaint&#34; is that one bag makes two cups of coffee, basically four cups when combined with water to drink.  I think that ends up being like two x-large iced coffees at the end of the day.  Its a good amount of work for that.

Other brands that I have tried often end having a musty type taste - I can only assume from the bag which the coffee grounds are in - but this really tastes like a true cold brew coffee.

It’s a medium dark roast with an even, medium grind. Medium and dark roast coffees are my favorite, but I do prefer a finer grind than this coffee for my drip coffeemaker or espresso machine as I like strong coffee that’s full bodied and flavorful. With a coarser grind than I usual use, this Red Diamond Classic coffee comes out best when I make it using my Small Bodum french press. I’m heavy handed with the coffee and use about three generous scoops, and this coffee comes out strong how I like it and with enough body to satisfy me. It tastes relatively smooth and not overly bitter, but I do add milk and either sugar or honey. I find the taste and aroma somewhat flat rather than rich and think this coffee lacks any distinctive flavor or characteristics.

3,B07DH7VCYX,2018-07-04 18:27:29.066,"Nice taste, decent quality coffee, but expensive and not as convenient as you might expect. I'm sort of torn about this review, as the taste of the coffee is very nice. But it seems to me that what is important is the difference between using these packs to make cold-brew coffee vs using a device and coffee you grind yourself. Since I do a lot of the latter, here's how it strikes me:<br /><br />1) The coffee is good, but not great, compared to buying good-quality beans and grinding them, and using a device. (I forget the name but I have a 2-quart mason-jar device with a large filter that goes down into the jar and when it's time to stop the brewing you pull the filter with the grounds out, and wash everything. It's not a big deal to do and I like the size because cold-brewed coffee stays nice in the frig much longer than chilled hot-brewed coffee.)<br /><br />2) I don't think the taste justifies the expense, though I suppose it's a nice easy way to see if one likes cold-brewed coffee before buying something to make it yourself.<br /><br />3) The biggest negative for me is that when you remove the bag with the grounds in it, you need to be very careful or it will tear. And given how much coffee is in the bag (given that you only started with 16 oz and there's much left by the time the grounds are saturated) you really need to let the coffee drain from it, and setting up a nice way to do that is tedious.",Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food
5,B07DH7VCYX,2020-08-13 00:25:00.232,"36-48hrs Preferred Brew Time = An UBER-RICH versatile concentrate!!! I decided to try this product in my quest for the right make at home cold brew coffee.  I like that the bags are in a reusable tin canister with the illustrations for how to use.<br /><br />I really like a dark rich end result that can hold its own over ice black or with a splash of flavored creamer. As a result, I used two bags in 4 cups of cold water and let it brew for a glorious 48 hours in the refrigerator. The end product was an EXTREMELY excellent uber-dark rich bold smooth concentrate you can't see through. I added 3 cups of cold water to the concentrate which still results in a FABULOUSLY rich dark pitcher of cold brew ready for the next few days. The New Orleans flavors are delightful and complex.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for anyone and encourage you to let the concentrate brew for 36-48 hours for the super dark rich concentrate with more versatility in dilution and serving options!!!

5,B086862MDH,2022-11-22 19:21:51.507,"Better Than Most. I’ve tried a lot of Almond Butters, and this is the one I’ll be buying from now on. The reasons are, it’s way easier to mix up because of the wide mouth jar.  It’s also got a silkier consistency than most.  When you open a new jar, you can use something like a couple of chopsticks to poke around and start stirring, there aren’t a lot of dry clumps.  The wide jar makes it much less messy, no oil spills over the side.<br /><br />The interesting thing is, they suggest refrigeration after stirring, which most natural nut butters tell you is unnecessary, however, I found refrigerating it does keep it from having to be stirred again, and it doesn’t become too thick to spread.  Nut butters usually wear out your wrists with all the stirring required, but not this one!<br /><br />The taste is fresh, the consistency is not “chalky” like some others.  I can’t think of any negatives, I didn’t even mention the fact that this is all natural with only one ingredient (which is awesome).

4,B086862MDH,2022-07-12 19:57:15.932,"Took quite a bit of stirring to get the separated oil to mix back in. The issue of oil separation of almond butters I've ordered from Amazon isn't new, but for some reason one of the jars I received was almost solid, totally separated from the oil.  I probably should have tried a power tool like a mixer rather than hand-mixing for 15 minutes.<br /><br />That said, the flavor is delicious and the consistency of the now-refrigerated almond butter is perfect.  It's possible that my batch had set on a shelf for a while, so I'll give it one fewer stars than a perfect 5.  If my next order is less like a brick when first opened, I'll update this to a 5-star rating.",Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

I do not like almond butter as much as peanut butter, but almond butter does not give me heart burn like peanut butter does.  This almond butter has no sugar or oil and therefore very healthy.

5,B002DO19HE,2016-05-18 23:03:49.000,Pretty good item. These are very good crusts but a little stale when purchased through amazon.  Better from grocery stores.,Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food
5,B002DO19HE,2022-09-01 02:37:32.343,"Easy/Good for Non-bakers! This is a great crust for time savers and non-bakers (i.e. the baking stupid like me who refuse to measure and don't want to mess with dough more than a few times a year). It will work for anything -sweet or savory and even no-bake dishes. It's super easy to handle and tastes quite good.<br /><br />I didn't do any fancy stuff like use a crust guard (don't own any such thing anyway) or use pie weights, but I did blind bake it for 10 minutes at 350. Even if you are making something like a no-bake pie, you will still want to bake your crust a bit. I forgot to prick it with a fork first and it puffed way up but then went back down to normal as it cooled. I made a quiche and fully cooked my vegetables in pan (asparagus, mushrooms, and leeks in some olive oil) prior to adding along with cheeses and egg mixture to the pre-baked crust.<br /><br />This crust is more savory than sweet (&lt;1 g sugar) with clean, simple organic ingredients... just three besides water and salt. That is how it should be... if you read the crust on a grocery store quiche, the crust ingredients are absurd. This is way healthier and only 2/3 the carbs (each crust has 80g carbs). So, if you eat 1/4 or less as a serving and the crust comprises 98% of the carbs in your dish, you could work this into a low-carb and possibly even keto diet.<br /><br />If you are planning to use this the same day you buy it or within 4-5 days... just store it in the fridge. Otherwise, keep it in the freezer and let in thaw before attempting to blind bake it. As you can see from the picture of this quiche, the crust didn't burn even when I blind baked it and then cooked the quiche another 40 or so minutes. So, I recommend this... it is kind of fool proof for most folks.",Grocery_and_Gourmet_Food

4,B0BBQXC87Q,2022-10-16 03:37:53.131,"Maybe overpriced but worth it!! This is a beautiful pendant by Missia. The packaging is lovely - a faux leather box which holds a wooden (walnut), mirrored heart. Inside the heart is a lovely, very feminine silver pendant. A single, large moissanite stone is set inside a setting that reminds me of lopsided, colliding hearts. It dangles from a thin, sterling silver chain. The center stone does have some sparkle without looking like cheap costume jewelry. Inside is a packet that includes a polishing cloth, authenticity card and small note. Some may think this necklace is overpriced, but the packaging definitely accounts for some of the cost. I’d recommend it.",Handmade_Products

5,B0BBQXC87Q,2022-10-17 19:27:26.124,"I'm not sure what is nicer, the necklace or the packaging! [[VIDEOID:b3f59105b97693aba15156fe1e9ab1b9]] This sterling silver Moissanite necklace is well crafted, it has a 1CT main stone and a double heart design. The necklace is beautiful to look at and the Moissanite certainly sparkles in all the colors of the rainbow. When looking at the necklace from back to front I did notice a few parts that didn't have the high polish, like around the barrel that holds the main stone but it's not noticeable unless looking up-close. I would say the necklace is 4 stars in my opinion due to the unpolished spots. When thinking about the necklace and the overall presentation with the leatherette box and heart shaped piano lacquered walnut jewelry box, I would say the overall presentation brings this necklace and it's giftability up-to 5 stars.<br /><br />The necklace is nice, but I think the piano lacquered walnut jewelry box really brings the whole presentation up a notch. The jewelry box even has a heart shaped mirror inside which is a nice touch. The leatherette box that holds the jewelry box is also well crafted. Inside of the leatherette box you will find the walnut jewelry box that holds the necklace and also a cardboard box that has a jewelry polishing, two heart shaped gifting paper gifting cards, product warranty card against any defects for a year and a GRA card that certifies the authenticity of the Moissanite stone.<br /><br />Overall beautiful necklace and well crafted jewelry box.

I'm a little disappointed in this, but hopefully, it will not continue to wear so quickly.<br /><br />I really like this bag. I purchased it as a replacement for my multiple Kavu bags and ""hippie"" purses. I needed something large that could function as both a purse and a diaper bag. The quality seems good, you can still smell the leather after a week of daily use. The only problem I found was there is a much lighter patch of leather on one of the corners. Not a deal-breaker for me though. I would also prefer that the brand tag was somewhere other than the front, but also not a big problem for me.",Handmade_Products

4,B0768W7G38,2018-04-03 10:10:48.419,"A few details I wasn't expecting. This bag arrived on great condition, the quality is very good. There are some dark spots where it looks like the leather was either artificially aged or maybe rubbed in transit? They do not detract from the natural look, I like that the bag doesn't look brand new. The canvas lining is green so things don't disappear into a black hole in the bucket, the lighter color helps see things inside. A cheap purse insert organizer works well in the main part of the bag. The two inside pockets are very nice. One zipper pocket on either side and they are bigger than expected. The top bag zipper closes from either end or the zippers can meet in the middle. The dual zipper does restrict the width of the opening just a bit tho. I have a 14inch laptop and it's a tight fit. The pocket on the front is lined as well. I deducted a star because the flap and snap on the pocket aren't lined up exactly and take a bit of fiddling to get it snapped. If you have much in the front pocket it won't snap it is designed to be snapped when almost flat. The flap doesn't have any expandability like the pocket does and that's why I deducted one star. The bag arrives very flat and I plan to take time to stuff it full and straighten out the bottom so maybe it will stand up? Overall I'm very happy with this and for what I paid for it.",Handmade_Products

5,B0BBQXC87Q,2022-09-28 01:08:37.965,"This is a gift that will make someone feel really special! Amazing packaging!! I have never had anything that has had so much care put into the packaging to make something seem so special. I cannot say enough about how exciting this was to open, and that was while knowing what was inside! The box that came is a great, solid box that has an almost leather feel to it. I will be keeping this box for little keepsakes for sure. Then, if that box wasn't wonderful enough, there is the most beautiful and high-shined heart wooden box that has such a unique design that I dropped it because I was too excited. I am a grown woman who ordered this for myself, and I was still giddy beyond belief. The cards that came with it have a 3D optical effect when you pull them out of the box because of the intricate lace pattern cut into the cover. Even the polishing cloth was packaged up in its own little high-quality folded box. The certification card is a nice hard plastic that is brought to a high shine and comes with a certificate of authenticity. I don't think I have ever had anything so special that it came with a certificate for authentication. All this wonder came before I even opened the box to see the necklace. What a fun build-up to a beautiful piece of art. <br />The necklace is wonderful. There is a shine that I have never seen, even on brand-new necklaces. How this is achieved, I cannot say. The sparkle is perfect to really inspire joy in anyone. The gem is truly unique. I am not a really big fan of diamonds. I think they are rather plain-looking when you see the alternatives that are so colorful and show imagination. For a similar reason, I am not a fan of roses. I love different and unique things that the masses have not overly processed. So this is perfect for my taste because this gem has the ability to shine and sparkle with the color spectrum but remain pure simultaneously. The wrap around the pendant is wonderfully sculpted, reminiscent of two hearts that have merged into one. This may be like an ink blot and each person can see something different, but I love this. I am not a big jewelry person. I have never worn much outside of earrings on special occasions and my wedding ring, but this will be worn on any special occasion I can. It would be perfect for a wedding or a Tuesday, really anything special. The chain is a bit too thin for me, so I will look into getting a little thicker one so it will remain more secure, but that is a personal choice because I tend to forget I am wearing these and they tend to get pulled on. This is very unique and I cannot express how truly special the whole package can make someone feel.",Handmade_Products

The inside doesn’t have a fancy interior but is instead made with this super sturdy fabric that I love! So you know it won’t rip! There are two pockets on the inside, same size on opposite sides, which is great, and an outer pocket. The leather smell is  a little strong the first day or two, but goes away quickly after that.

A wooden heart box within a leather box and a beautiful intricately cut card for gifting. Highly recommend!<br /><br />I truly love moissanite, not only is it one of the best stones to shine and shimmer in the light, but is better than a diamond in sooo many ways. Really, do some research into why diamonds are bad, why moissanite is amazing, and why you should invest in these stones instead of diamonds.<br /><br />The presentation of this necklace is just amazing as well, and I think this would be a perfect gift for anyone to show how much they love someone. I got this for my fiancé (now wife!!) to wear on our wedding day and she not only loved it but looked so so amazingly beautiful that day! I couldn’t have picked a better necklace for her!<br /><br />My only issue is that the chain length was like a choker on her and we had to trade out the chain for one of her other nice chains. Once switched out it fit muuuch better! Would be nice if they would offer a longer chain for this necklace, otherwise this is a great jewelry piece!l",Handmade_Products

Anyways I contacted the sellers and they answered pretty quickly and offered an apology, an explanation, and a replacement free of charge. The bracelet itself is very cute and I’m sure the discoloration is because each rock is naturally different. It’s so cute and I would gladly buy something from this company again.

3,B0741259TJ,2018-07-28 18:11:37.954,"Shipping issues distressed the leather with bends that will not unmark this beautiful item! This is a well made and wonderful notebook for business travel.  It could be a bit cumbersome for everyday use without a way to fold it back and hold comfortably. It is not a tight fit and does allow for additional reference materials in the jacket. I would recommend a removable leather piece tucked into the pocket for additional protection to the screen.<br /><br />The soft-sided box did not protect the item enough in shipping as you can see in my photo. It bent the frame that holds the iPad. Since this came engraved we placed the plastic in the hot sun by a window and the next day forced the iPad into the plastic. It successfully reformed around the iPad after two days in the sun. The heat of the sun also reshaped the leather as we knew it would, however, treating the leather did not remove the lines of damage to the item.<br /><br />This is a beautifully crafted distressed leather cover. It has character and is very well made. I would have preferred to distress it with age and use instead of the shipping but would hope this craftsman would consider an insert to keep the IPad holder's shape and protect the overall product in future shipping.

Some of the seams on the inside are a little frayed but that's because of the material. It has two zippered pockets on the inside which is really nice and they are really deep going almost to the bottom. That makes it nice because i always stick my battery pack in the side pocket and it's heavy so with it resting at the bottom of the pocket, it doesn't pull the rest of the bag down.

5,B0768W7G38,2019-03-30 15:22:19.604,"Very nice bag. I decided after buying faux leather and other material bags, that I was ready for a nice real leather bag. I shopped for two weeks before i found this one. I was looking for a specific size and shape. First, the quality of this bag is oustanding. It looks like a hand-made bag which is what I was after the quality of the materials and workmanship is amazing. And if you can't tell whether the bag is real leather by its appearance, the smell will certainly confirm it-real leather smell!  Even the hardware on the bag is excellent quality. I was a tiny bit disappointed with the front pock as it can't be overfilled if you expect to close it but this was more than made up four by the two huge interior zip pockets. So I keep my cell phone, sunglasses and keys etc in the front for easy access and use those two huge pockets for everything else. The middle holds my wallet and ipad with plenty of room to spare. So in conclusion if you are looking for a real big real leather bag, this is definately the one! I was going to post a picture but the seller's pictures are very accurate.",Handmade_Products

Upon receiving it, I also like that it is compact and once it is in water, it expands, so it makes it easy to store. I do like the sponge side. It worked quite well. I wasn't as keen on the loofah side. It is very loofah-like so how it 'scrubbed' had a different feel than the usual scrubber. It felt like it took longer to get the dish or pot etc to get clean. I ended up switching back to my usual dishwashing sponge. That said, I do like this scrub/sponge combo to clean the sink and stove. It was great on my stove top. That's the reason why I put it at a 4-star. I didn't like it so much for dishwashing; but I do like it for other cleaning.",Health_and_Household

I have to be on top of my game as far as weight maintenance is concerned, as I used to have full blown Type 2 Diabetes. I love this beautiful weighing scale because it gives me accurate numbers every single time I use it. I can also opt to use it in conjunction with my smart phone, so I am well aware of weight goals. This weighing scale's features fit my lifestyle and it supports multi user functions - which allows/allowed me to share it with my husband. It also has an optional weightless weighing (my most favorite feature) which I really like, because it makes me focus on the positive side of maintaining my current weight. Sometimes, when you look at your weighing scale and you initially see big numbers, you get discouraged. Needless to say, this well though of product is a big help in boosting your determination to stay healthy.<br /><br />I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.

5,B00FT8ZHHE,2015-07-15 16:35:01.000,"Great scale, but if you use your phone app a lot, get their bluetooth model! This is an great scale!  It works perfectly right out of the box.  The design is clean and sleek.  It has a low profile and it's very easy to use.  You  put one foot on it to wake it up, then wait until it shows 0, then step back onto the scale.  The numbers are large and easy to see.<br /><br />After you get your weight, the screen gives a funny looking message (scanner code), this is the image you scan with your phone app to track your history on your smartphone/tablet.  I think this is the only downside to this scale for me.  If I had done more research, I think I would have purchased the scale with bluetooth built in so I wouldn't need to scan the code that pops up.  (This has only become an issue for me since I'm a klutz and fell off my porch, so it's hard for me to bend right now!)<br /><br />What I personally like about this scale is that you can set it to not show your full weight, just the current loss or addition from your last reading.<br /><br />This scale also has the option to set up and recognize other users, but I honestly have not tried out that function yet!<br /><br />*Edited on 7/28 -  I almost never change my review scoring, but after working with the seller for tips on how to get the scan function to work with my phone better (hold phone about a foot away from the scale or around waist height), I have decided that I really LOVE this scale!  Since I have had time to heal from when I originally wrote the review, it is easier for me to bend to scan the code.<br /><br />They also worked with me to get the calibration working properly after I mentioned that I store it between uses.  You turn it on and wait for it to show 0.0 BEFORE stepping on it if you put it away between uses!<br /><br />*I purchased this item at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review and I can see myself keeping this model for a long time!",Health_and_Household

4,B00FT8ZHHE,2014-06-08 03:25:40.000,"Lovely scale, but damn those sharp edges! It's a very lovely looking scale. It has nice features, from the small amount of time I used the app it did work. The accuracy is great, I was buying low quality scales that would tell me different weights each time I stepped on it. This one doesn't do that. The screen is large and LED lighted, so much easier to read than most scales.<br /><br />The cons are low but pretty important if you're looking for your perfect scale.<br />First, it's glass. So while being beautiful, it is delicate. Second, it has sharp edges, I'm not joking. If you're going to put it in a smaller bathroom with not much room and might smack your foot on it, you might want to consider another scale; it HURTS when you hit it and after the third time I put it in the kitchen instead. Third and lastly, the app is quite underdeveloped if you're looking at this scale as a cheap smart phone tracker. I used it for a bit but if you're not going to be active, then the app isn't the best for you. I also don't track my weight every day as I can flux 3~5 pounds a day, and that's one of the key features for the app.<br /><br />However, they're improving the app all the time so maybe sometime soon, I could track food and calories easily like the app I currently use.",Health_and_Household

Then I rinsed the jewelry under warm water (make sure to get all of it off!) and dried it completely. Tah-dah! Gorgeous. Looks new.<br /><br />Notes about the product-arrives in a plastic bag-I advise keeping this for storage. It is also *very* full, so be careful when opening!

3,B00FT8ZHHE,2014-08-05 20:00:50.000,Slow processing not worth extra functionality. It takes quite a long time to report your weight after you stand on it - or at least it seems so relative to how long a non-digital scale takes. A scale that I've had since the 90s reports the weight in about a quarter of the time. I haven't tried to set up the app but I imagine this extra functionality is behind the slow processing - if that component is not important to you then you are probably better off with a different scale.,Health_and_Household

I originally wanted to purchase a scale that can upload the user's weight directly to an IPhone via bluetooth, but those scales have additional features such as body fat measurement and send signals to your body to measure. Due to the later, it cannot be used for children under 10 and those using a heart rate minitor. My son is only 4 and I occasionally weight him, so this works well.

You have to use the camera on your phone to scan the bar code that appears on the scale's screen in order to sync the data. Still works, but it is 3 steps more than I understood it to be. It was also rather confusing to set up: I'm pretty technologically savvy but I had to have a computer programmer friend of mine set it up for me. Other than that it works great.

I am glad I bought this one.  It is very easy to use--just step on it and it identifies which user you are out of up to 8 users and then gives your weight in pounds and tenth of pounds, i.e. 139.4.  You can adjust to give your weight in other measuring systems also.  You can also program it to not give your weight but to simply tell how much weight you have lost, or gained, since the last time you used it i.e. -1.7  or +0.6. And you can download an app to track your weight with your Smart phone--if you choose. The blue back-lighting is pretty and looks just as bright as the photo.  The scale is simple and sleek.  My ONLY negative is standing on the glass feels cool to my bare feet.  The company who sells this has great communication and stands behind their product.

I think this one is perfect for women/girls, or just anyone that cannot hold anything too heavy but still want the benefits of a massage gun. Don't be mistaken though, just because it is a smaller unit does not mean it isn't powerful! There are four speeds to choose from and at the highest speedy, it packs the same powerful punch as those big massage guns.

Even though it has a sync button it uses the camera in your phone misleading description extremely slow to decide user and give you weight then even slower to give qr also in order to use it you must sign up for there app so i am sure they are sellling info and phisihing your personal info. Save some money and type into an app yourself.<br />I assume the scale is accurate but description is misleading and even with the discount i got was not worth the money.<br /><br />I also dont generally take the time to write negative reviews i usually just write it off as lesson learned but its one of those companies that now that they have my email address they are pestering me.<br />They asked for a review and now they want to know more.

4,B00FT8ZHHE,2014-09-10 17:42:43.000,"Great little scale. I haven't had this scale very long so it is hard to rate it yet. I've decided that I need to do something about my weight. I've been using the scale daily for the past 6 days. It is a little finicky about registering the barcode on my iPhone, but I'm getting the hang of it and I like the feature very much. Dieting and weighing daily I've noticed that each day, I've lost a little--until today, when I gained. Not sure if it is the scale or me. When you diet, you sometimes see days like that.<br /><br />I do believe the scale is a great value for what it offers. it works as advertised. I would recommend it. Why only 4 stars? Well, the bar code reading isn't flawless. Sometimes, it has to be done more than one time to register. Not sure if Bluetooth would be a better choice, but you really can't miss at this price. I'm happy with it even though I'm NOT happy with my weight. ;-)<br /><br />Update (January 30, 2015):<br /><br />I've been using the Weight Guru Scale for a 147 days now. I've lost 33+ pounds. It is slow going based on what others seem to lose, but I'm happy. I'm retired and I am not a huge exercise fanatic so therein lies a part of it. I met my first goal and decided that I'd like to go further so I have another 5 pounds to go. I attribute part of my success to this scale. The record keeping on the iPhone really helps. It is also easy enough to use the barcode scanner. I think the value for what you get is amazing. The scale definitely has me hooked. I will, now, always use a daily weigh in scale like this. Losing weight takes fortitude and a mind change, but with this scale, I'm expecting that I will be able to keep the weight off once and for all. I'd recommend it.",Health_and_Household

5,B000BODTWQ,2010-12-12 10:16:28.000,"Best silver polish you can get. When you have 16 place settings, serving ware, bowls, coffee service and trays to clean but your guests are arriving in an hour, this is the only cleaner that can reliably see you through.  It is a workhorse, doing an excellent, thorough, safe job on your expensive silver ware in a short time with minimal physical effort.  With silver, small physical effort is important, not only because it's easy but because you will not risk bending your silver or twisting it by working too hard with the polish.  The key is to follow the instructions and not get the items or this thick-mud-consistency polish wet until the rinse phase.  A dry/barely-damp sponge is enough.  They call it ""foam"" but that's only because it will foam up a little as you work with it.  It's not like those scrubbing bubbles in a bathroom cleaner.  If you have picture frames or something that you cannot get wet, you'd need a different product by Hagerty instead.  If you can get your stuff wet (rinsing), the ""foam"" is the best product of the lot.  It stores well, you are not going to accidentally use too much and you don't have to buy it often as you might with a liquid polish.<br /><br />My grandmother worked in silver shops for over 30 years and this is the best polish.

Also helps regulate blood sugar spikes. Everyone noticed a difference right away within the first month.

Too moist and the often leave spots or streaks. Too dry and they don't clean oily smudges but rather smear it around. Where these wipe &#34;sets&#34; stand out is that it's basically a two stage cleaning system.

When I'm swollen from the RA, it puts more pressure on the carpal band and is really painful. While wearing a stiff brace throughout the day is needed, it ends up hurting in a different way after being so stiff all day. Putting this on in the evening is like putting on a cloud brace. It still has a metal splint, but there's more padding and the cushioning in the palm area adds stability but its not rigid.

4,B086KT5RN5,2021-08-16 02:49:57.206,Not bad. So I have recently got into canning. Not the full blown Canning but just the waterbath a Canning that does jams and jellies. I wanted to start easy with an apple butter recipe.<br /><br />Well I realized that the apples had to be blended while they were still hot. I have a little magic bullet blender but it is plastic. I cannot put hot items in a plastic blender or it would break the blender. When I was researching options I realized that it was smarter to buy this because I could use it from multiple regular uses as well as my canning uses. Plus I have been wanting one for a while. So I actually asked for a friend‘s help and we went through the reviews on multiple items and came up with this one. I like the way it works. I didn’t give it five stars because it was a little slow at blending my apples but it did eventually get them to a good consistency.  No I do know that it is a safety measure that there is no on and off switch and that you have to hold a button to keep it going but it is a little hard because it vibrates a bunch in your hand and you have to put it down after a tiny bit of time,Home_and_Kitchen

I mostly use it on those ugly prehistoric looking stink bugs.  I do not fry them because they stink.  So I just vacuum them up and dump them in a container with alcohol and they die very quickly. I may have as many as 5 or 6 at a time and as long as the vac is on they cannot escape.  Then turn it upside down let go of the vac button and they fall into the alcohol. Dead!!!,Home_and_Kitchen

5,B01HHEH3C4,2022-11-06 17:03:51.506,"Great knife. I've had this knife for 3 years now, two of which were in a professional setting, and it's still as sharp as the day I got it.<br /><br />I bought it because the knives provided by my employer were hit or miss and I was tired of having to sharpen them every time I needed to prep something. I used it daily at work as well for two years as well as at home(which is where it resides now after changing professions) and the most it ever needed was a few runs on a honing rod.<br /><br />What made me get this knife was that it didn't have a heel, making it easier to filet and slice. This made it suitable for most tasks so you don't have to be that guy with a whole roll of knives at work, which seemed overkill since I wasn't working at a michelin star restaurant.<br /><br />I kept it in a plastic sheath, hand washed/dried it after every use, and only ever lightly honed it on a stick. That along with proper cutting techniques, aka not abusing it, has allowed this knife to fair better than most knives I've used at a fraction of the price. However, something to keep in mind is that this knife has a 12* edge so whatever you do, do NOT sharpen it on a regular sharpener as it will ruin the edge since most knives are 20*.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good entry level knife to start off with in a kitchen or just a good knife for use at home I'd highly recommend this one.",Home_and_Kitchen

Also, IMPORTANT: it's listed as having an 8-12 degree edge. If you use a sharpener on it be sure it's the right one! A sharpener designed to give a 20 degree edge (which is what most American knives have) will ruin the edge (he said with a sad sigh...).

Well the compact size of this device solved that problem completely. I am able to keep it in a drawer and quickly pull it out to reseal the deli meat or cheese. Suction can be a bit finicky at first but you quickly get the hang of it. And the problems are usually with the bag or specifically how much “stuff” you put in the bags. I find it works best when there is ample room at the top for the seal valve to sit flat on your countertop. Also make sure that the press and seal closure is completely closed or else you will never get a true vacuum.,Home_and_Kitchen

Felt like I needed a step stool to be able to hold it comfortably. But the biggest issue is the fact that it didn't pull liquids up from the bottom. I was making fruit bars which means I had to mix honey, coconut oil and an egg thoroughly enough to cream them together.

5,B09W25LTPT,2022-07-16 00:56:52.341,"The Corkie colorful pepper grinders. I saw these listed, really liked the ""cute"" factor of the multicolored LEDs, and gave them a shot.  Ha!, they really are pretty cute.  The multicolor blinky lights go in sequence around this translucent lip, and yep, there are 4 LEDs to show the grinder's charge level.  I imagine the lights are more a novelty than a necessity, but it's fun to look at, and my cat is fascinated by the lights.  :D<br /><br />The motor seems powerful enough, after loading up with those fancy multicolored peppercorns (black, red, brownish, tan, etc.) to match the festive colors.  Do I need the lights?  No.  Are they fun?  Yeah, why not?  :D<br /><br />Anyway, you can adjust the grind from fine to chunky.  For eggs, I like chunky, to get little bursts of pepper flavor.<br /><br />After charging them with the included usb cables, I got to work.  I tried both ""manual"" and ""automatic"" modes, but the manual doesn't describe how to select them.  It's pretty easy, though.  When pointed upward, turning it on gets the blinkies going and it's in automatic mode.  Tilt it to squeeze out pepper, and it does.  Tilt it back upright, and it turns off.  I haven't timed it, but after a while, it snaps out of automatic mode and turns back off into standby.  For manual mode, just point it down at the food, press to turn on, press to turn off.  Simple!<br /><br />One thing I confess that I like most about them is that the ""output"" is on top and not the bottom.  I hate hate hate when peppermills have the output on the bottom, because it can be placed on a table or countertop that's wet, greasy, dirty, etc., and potentially all that dirt sticks to where the pepper comes out.  The grinders I have now, I have ""coasters"" that they sit in, basically just lids from used jars of peanut-butter and the like (cup-shaped also catches loose pepper).  At least that on these, the output is on top, so it stays clean.  It's frankly the first grinder I have which has that feature.<br /><br />So absolutely, I like these.  :D",Home_and_Kitchen

I have a Chef's Choice Trizor XV Knife Sharpener (15-degree edge angle) and intend to start honing the  Tatara traditional, right-handed chef's knife (front edge facet on right side of knife) in the left slot of stage 2 of the sharpener and then proceed to stropping/polishing as specified in the Chef's Choice instruction manual.

4,B07WMPJXDF,2022-10-21 01:12:02.186,"Mostly but not quite good. Overall, the design idea is good. The material seems to be good. The track sections were manufactured to too tight a tolerance. As noted in other reports, each track section needs just a little rework to trim down the stops. Once the stops are trimmed, the track will lie flat. If too much is trimmed from the stops, the track will not support itself when it is bent.<br /><br />If you have time and patience, I recommend the track. If you have neither time nor patience, you should find another product that meets your needs better.",Industrial_and_Scientific
5,B0BGJ5B15R,2022-11-01 14:10:53.371,"Very handy! I’ve used clips like this before at work but I don’t own any. At home, I’ve used short wires with alligator clips on both ends to accomplish a similar function. These clips are much more useful and safe.<br /><br />The clips operate smoothly and grab very firmly. They open up pretty wide and I was able to get them around a 12 ga wire easily which was the largest I had handy. The insulation is flexible and feels durable. It fits inside the plug and clip firmly and there are no exposed wire. Be aware that the clips are only rated for 5A at 30VAC/60VDC, so if you’re looking for something higher, you’ll need to look elsewhere.<br /><br />The pass-through banana connections work well, plugs fit in firmly but not so much they are difficult to remove. The banana plugs on my test leads have a safety sheath so they won’t work with the pass-through but I can get some lower voltage leads that will.<br /><br />I got about .3 ohms on all clips but that is the same as my test leads, so I probably need a fresh battery in my meter.<br /><br />If you’re looking for a set of low voltage test lead clips, I think you’ll be happy with these.",Industrial_and_Scientific

2,B07WMPJXDF,2021-09-19 03:12:47.422,"Requires a lot of manual adjustments. This ""chain"" is incredibly stiff and the manufacturing is just plain off. It physically cannot lay flat without 5-10 lbs of pressure to make it do so, and it wont stay as soon as you let up. You have to disconnect every single link and widdle down the legs which create the physical stop so that each individual link has the extra millimeter it needs to fully extend into a 180 degree arrangement and not 175 degrees. That only solves one problem them, and for some maybe the second problem isn't as big of a deal. The links are so tight against eachother that they do not maintain a fluid chain-like movement and instead create awkward and unpredictable chains of links that wont flex, thus causing abnormal kinks. Sure, I could go through and drill out every hole in each link so that it had the extra space to actually move, or I could go buy another product and quit wasting my time trying to fix this one.<br /><br />Upgraded to 2 stars only because the material does actually feel nice and durable, even if the manufacturing tolerances for functional specifications is missing.",Industrial_and_Scientific

I put water in them and dumped them upside down and they didn’t leak with or without the seal! Thank goodness. I didn’t realize that these came with the seals so if you put the lid on the first time and screw them down until you hear the click, it’s sealed. Obviously once you break that seal the first time it won’t seal again just like a drink you purchase in the store. The quality is amazing!

Clean the spot on the appliance with alcohol prior to applying the adhesive and there shouldn't be a problem. I also recommend letting the casters ""cure"" a bit after applying and before heavy use.<br />I can see these being a great help to someone who isn't strong enough to move things easily and I feel like they are more versatile than the appliance sliders they sell.  Certainly a more affordable option.<br />I did notice the heavier items weren't as smooth sliding, but I didn't find them to lock up while moving so that's good.<br />I believe you will find lots of uses for these in the kitchen, office, craft room, garage, etc.",Industrial_and_Scientific

4,B0BGJ5B15R,2022-12-06 05:17:54.397,"Nice little grabbers but stiffer than silicone leads. These test hook leads by BOCEUC are a handy set to have with your electrical testing tools.  You get 5 testing leads x 3 feet each made from PVC insulated 20awg wire of various colors including black and red.  The plug ends are standard 4mm stackable banana style plugs which are compatible with many testers or multimeters.  The testing ends feature a neat little sprung loaded micro hook which is great for situations where the traditional alligator clips are too bulky.  These can get into tight spaces very well and will grab your wires or terminals securely.<br /><br />The current price of these is $15.99 which is a little higher than some others but the PVC insulation also makes these less flexible and less heat resistant than silicone coated testing leads especially for only being 20awg wire.  Also be aware that with it being 20awg, these are only rated for use up to 30VAC or 60VDC at 5Amps and so are best suited for smaller electronic applications.

They are very sturdy allright, but maybe a little too sturdy - they are just a tad too big.  When I hook them up to neighboring pins of a standard 0.1""-spaced header, they touch.  You can finagle two neighboring hooks to have them face each other and MAYBE not touch, but this isn't safe - if you cough, all bets are off.  Hooking them up to three neighboring pins without any two touching is impossible.<br /><br />Of course, for everything else, they work just fine, and the robustness of the thicker material is a plus, after all, this is a ""special"" application - but it is still a rather common one.",Industrial_and_Scientific

And she shouldn't get a drop on her, the car or the road. And it should fill quickly. And it should go in the car trunk or the back of the truck without getting gas all over the place.

I loved this book! Mac is on a quest to find the second love of her mother's life, and she has decided to screen each date before setting them up with her mom. First she tries relatives of friends, then personal ads, online dating, a nice gentleman acquaintance, and speed dating. Can she find a happily ever after for her mom?<br /><br />The dates that Mac went on for her mother were hilarious. The author really created some slimy men, but there were a few good ones thrown in as well. Mac's strained relationship with her mother seemed realistic, and Mac's raltionship with her boyfriend seemed very realistic as well. I liked that Mac and Dan were not this perfect, lovey couple, and that they had real relationship issues that people face everyday.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just a sucker for a happy ending, but I really enjoyed the book. I also thought that the ending was a surprising, and not happy and perfectly wrapped up like one might expect from a book in this genre. It was a good chick lit read that I would recommend, and I will watch for more from this author.",Kindle_Store
4,B07C94LF8W,2018-05-28 21:39:54.637,"Can an Improbable Cast of Characters Stop Dr. Perry?. Doctor Perry by New Zealand-based author Kirsten McKenzie derives its suspense from the question, can the improbable cast of characters she has assembled stop the nefarious Dr. Perry?  That Dr. Perry is evil is never in doubt – even the cover asks, ‘can you trust your doctor?’  But hanging in a delicate balance is whether the downtrodden and forgotten of the world can stop him?  Can Elijah Cone, a once famous but now forgotten football coach nearly bed-ridden with arthritis put up a fight?  Might Doctor Perry’s totally subservient wife rebel?  Could the gregarious, plus-sized Indian woman, Sulia Patel, make any difference, even if she is one of the few willing to resist?  And the police?  If they are to make any difference, they’ll need to overcome their incredulity and do more than arrive at Dr. Perry’s location…soon after he has left.  Whether this motley crew will succeed is definitely in question to the very end, to the author’s credit.<br /><br />The pacing of the book was good, with a range of people coming and going.  Many of them were grist for Dr. Perry’s malicious scheme, some were potential liberators, while still others seemed distractors added simply to build tension.  Or perhaps they provide groundwork for a sequel.  In any case, they did little to further the plot.  Some of the characters were well-developed, Elijah Cone and to a degree, Sulia Patel, being in that category.  But overall, the characters tended toward extreme stereotypes.  If you think of a bottom-line-driven, totally heartless retirement home administrator, you have Tracey Chappell.  Retirement home workers who looked the other way to keep their paycheck were in abundance.  The drug addict who never met a pill he didn’t want to snort or smoke was also there.  And several of these characterizations became well-worn by the end.<br /><br />There was a small disconnect between the language of the author and the setting.  The latter was Florida, while the former was definitely non-American, with words like ‘mould’ for ‘mold,’ and phrases that would be unfamiliar to the U.S. reader.  But the dissonance is slight.  More significant is the lack of a troubling technology at the heart of this book’s plot.  Masters of the medical thriller use examples that seem so real, readers wonder if they missed an announcement in the news.  The horror Dr. Perry wrought was a bit far-fetched, the suspense suffering as a result.<br /><br />Overall, Doctor Perry is an entertaining book, although it requires some imagination to achieve thriller status.",Kindle_Store

4,B07744NLFR,2018-05-29 06:33:10.617,"Interesting. This book is really humerous and moved at a good clip. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5 is, because the leftist  had to throw in bogus racist comments. Meaning they weren't racist. Only in the minds of the fascists. For example: “I think it’s Casablanca. Humphrey Bogart. Coolest guy ever. Did you know that line ‘play it again, Sam,’ is actually a misquote? In the movie, Bogart just says, ‘play it!’ and it comes across as vaguely racist as he orders the black guy to play piano for him.” This is not and was not racist. That was how his character talked and acted. If his best friend, father, sister, his mother, or his priest was up there, he would have said the same words the same way. Quit trying to change history. It's bad enough I have to listen to this crap on TV,  the news and movies, now I am forced to read it? Good pros, good story, likable characters. Just get rid of the politics.

But a few things… Key never went to Rehad, there was no talk on how the news was broken to Seriyah about her mom not coming back (dead), and no mention about the fact that Chanelle was working for Santiago unknowingly.

I was determined to finish the book to see if the plot would develop into something worthwhile - the best part came close to the end when the killer was revealed - I will say that was a good twist.<br /><br />The main character, Sam, is a grown woman who is a social worker.  She has two grown children in college.  She has 'vibes' that assist her in detective work.  I tell you this as she reads as a teen - a bit off putting.  She comes off more as a busy body than a detective.<br /><br />One redeeeming part of the book was the dog - hard not to like Clancy who acted older than Sam<br /><br />You have your romance - of course there are two love interests so you have to read the next book if you want to see who the victor is.

4,B07C94LF8W,2018-06-07 15:46:47.821,"Disturbing Psychological Horror. I have just completed reading Dr. Perry by Kirsten McKenzie and I am still shuddering. I liked this author’s writing style from the outset.  It’s professional, pacy, and way more than competent. With this immediate impression, I knew that whatever the story was to be about, I would enjoy it.<br /><br />However, I have to say that the early chapters in the Rose Haven Retirement Home were totally unexpected and difficult for me to read. Let me say they were well-written, underpinned with specific knowledge, and very obvious experience of such living conditions. But the descriptions of the miserly existence in that care home were seriously disturbing for a healthy senior person like me who would run  leagues to escape such a void and friendless existence.  And reading about it doesn’t make it any more appealing. The depictions of the very second-rate care home, its grubby minimalist living conditions, the brutal unfeeling manager and the corrupt employees, made this a nightmare to read about. The depression that hovered over the place like a miasma, the soul-destroying lack of any real hope ...God help any old people who have to end their days in a place like this. Don’t get me wrong. There was nothing wrong with the writing or the story. That was the problem for me. Both were just too real.<br /><br /> In fact, I was beginning to wonder precisely what the story was about when the creepy, self-deluded, utterly evil Dr. Perry appeared on the scene with his original but seriously spine-chilling experiments. When I read the first example of the guy waiting to be freed of arthritic pain only to suddenly go through the most sadistic torture as his body regresses to childhood .... wow! I was ready to scream myself.<br />And then come the questions, the fears, the doubts. Can the tired, arthritic Elija Cone, with  his secrets and solitariness, and the fat, garrulous Sulia Patel, even begin to mount any kind of challenge to the evil that Dr. Perry is visiting on their residence and its people? This is the totally uneven match that keeps the reader in panic throughout.<br /><br />I was reminded to a degree of some the weird novels Stephen King has written when I read Dr. Perry. There was that strange imagination that would create unusual and unexpected scenes and conflicts, loads of well written characters from the likable to the hateful, a plot with interesting sub-plots very skillfully handled ... all brilliantly designed to keep the reader glued to the pages (in a fingers-over-the-eyes kinda way!).<br /><br />I hate giving away spoilers in my reviews and I won’t do that this time either. But if you are a fan of weird or psychological horror, or even of Stephen King, you will find that the couple of dollars this book costs will be well spent money.

4,B0097GFP0I,2012-11-29 20:21:46.000,"Hilarious Chick Lit!! I have to say, I'm not much of a chick-lit reader. Something about it just throws me off, but this book is the exception to my rule. The mother almost made me want to toss the book away, but fortunately it's on my Kindle, no tossing any books that are on there! ;) No, but seriously. The mom... whew. She reminds me of the bad times I've had with my mother and there have been many. That's the great thing about growing up, you learn that neither of you are perfect. Fortunately though Kismetology brings out the funniness of having a mother like this as the main character of the story goes off to find her mother a boyfriend.<br /><br />Sadly MacKenzie has to go through a few, and I do mean a few men to find that ONE for her mother. I mean there are a few doozies in here! The main plot of the book is really positive and upbeat. Hilarious at times. Literally in a, I nearly spit out my tea I was laughing so hard. I didn't love Dan from the beginning. I don't know why, maybe I'm just a pessimist but that guy just gets under my skin for some reason. MacKenzie however is a sweet, courageous girl who just wants the best for her mother.<br /><br />As I said above, this is a total feel good story. And I must say I was quite impressed that I came away feeling SO good about it. Who knew I could find a chick lit that I was in love with!? For a first novel I think this is outstanding and I can't wait to see what else Jaimie comes up with! A++",Kindle_Store

4,B07C94LF8W,2018-07-09 11:46:18.611,"Insidious and disquieting horror. Great evil characters, a very satisfying ending. I write this review as a member of Rosie’s Book Review Team and thank Rosie Amber and the author for providing me with an ARC copy of this novel, that I freely chose to review.<br />I read and reviewed Kirsten McKenzie’s book Painted a while back and thoroughly enjoyed the experience, so when I heard about her new novel, and after reading the description, I knew I should read it.<br />Although the topic is quite different, there are many similarities between this story and the author’s previous incursion into the horror genre. The setting is not quite as important as the old house was in Painted, but Rose Haven, the retirement home where much of the action takes place, plays a central role in the story. This home, which had previously been a motel, has not much to recommend it, other than being cheap. There are a few sympathetic members of staff, but mostly, from the director to the nursing and auxiliary staff, people are in it for what they can get, try to do as little as possible, and some are downright dangerous. Caring professionals they are not, that’s for sure. What comes across more than anything is how dehumanised and dehumanising a place it is, but there are also gothic elements to it, particularly the doctor’s lab, that seems to have come right out of Frankenstein or Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The novel also has a timeless feel, as there is talk about television and the news, but no mention of social media or modern technology, and the action is set in the recent past, or in a parallel time-frame, similar but not quite the same as our present. Even with the outdoors scenes and the many settings, the novel manages to create a sense of claustrophobia that makes readers feel uneasy as if they were also trapped and caught up in the conspiracy.<br />I found this novel much more plot-driven than the previous one. The cast of characters is much larger here (there is a list at the end, which is quite useful), and it is not always easy to keep them separate, as some of them don’t have major roles, and sometimes the only difference between them might be their degree of nastiness or their specific bad habits (drug use, thieving, violence…). Some characters we don’t know well enough to be able to make our minds up about, like the police officers or some of Dr Perry’s patients. There are not many truly sympathetic characters, and even those (like Elijah and Sulia) show a certain degree of moral ambiguity that makes the novel much more interesting and realistic in my opinion. The book is full of characters that show psychopathic tendencies, and its shining star is Doctor Perry. I’ll try not to reveal any spoilers, but from the cover of the book and the description, I think anybody reading the book will know who the main baddie is (as I said, he’s not alone, but he is in a league of his own). He is a fascinating character, and we learn more and more about him as we read, although there’s enough left to readers’ imagination to keep him alive in our minds for a long time. Oh, there are two other characters that are quite high up in the malevolent league, but I’ll let you discover them yourselves. (I love them!)<br />The author uses the same peculiar point of view she used in Painted to narrate the story. The novel is written in the third person, from the point of view of most of the characters, from the residents in the hospital to the receptionist, and of course, the doctor, while also having moments when we are told things from an outside observer’s perspective (it is not a third-person omniscient POV but it is not a third-person limited point of view either, but a combination of the two), and that increases the intrigue and adds to the novel rhythm and pacing. There is head-hopping, as a chapter can be experienced through several different characters, and I recommend paying attention to all the details, although the main characters are very distinct and their points of view easy to tell apart. The mystery, in this case, is not who the guilty party is (that is evident from the beginning) but what exactly is happening and who the next victim will be. And also, how it will all end. In case you’re wondering, and although I won’t give you any specifics, I enjoyed the ending.<br />There are great descriptions of places, characters’ thoughts, and their sensations (including those due to chronic illness, which are portrayed in a realistic and accurate way), and also of some of the ‘supernatural’ (I can’t be more precise not to ruin the surprise) processes that take place. There is more gore in this novel than in the previous one, and although it is not extreme, I would not recommend it to people who are hypersensitive and have a vivid imagination unless they like horror. If you can easily “feel the pain” of the characters, this could be torture.<br />Another fascinating novel by Kirsten McKenzie, and one that will make readers think beyond the plot to related subjects (elderly abuse, unethical behaviours by caring professionals…). Great evil characters and a very satisfying ending. I recommend it to readers of horror who enjoy a gothic touch, and to those who prefer their horror ambiguous, insidious, and disquieting.<br />(Don’t miss the mention of a real orphanage in Florida and the link to donate to their important cause).",Kindle_Store

I like the fact that Samantha Darling is an unlikely detective. Makes the story able to relate to better.<br /><br />The story is very well written,never boring, and you won't want to put it down once you start. Unlike some stories where you have trouble following the plot, you can follow this one from start to finish and never get lost. The author does not over detail us with unneeded facts. We start reading and the action takes of from the beginning. Another thing I like about the book is the ability of those people trying to solve this mystery coming closer in friendship as they work on it.<br /><br />The characters are very well defined and explained. As you read, you will find yourself with a picture image of what each of them looks like and what makes them tick.<br /><br />Now, I am wondering if this novel will have a sequel or not. You can't leave us hanging as to which guy Sam ends up with. And, all I can say to the author is this.... Oh! PLEASE make it be George!!<br /><br />I recommend this book for mid teens on up.

Have you ever thought that you would be better off if something drastic happened to the boss who makes your life miserable? Well, if you have, you are not alone. Then I ask you: Is it better to have a difficult boss or a dead one? Samantha Darling can answer that question for you in Jerilyn Defresne’s Sam Darling Mystery, Who Killed My Boss?<br /><br />Defresne hooks the reader on the first page. Sam has just been employed by Dr. Burns and sits in the offices of human resources when --<br /><br />A scream brought us both to our feet. [Leonard] Schnitzer jumped up<br />ready to investigate. I wasn’t as excited as he was. Hell, this was a<br />psychiatric clinic. People yelled in psychiatric clinics.<br /><br />But before Schnitzer leaves to investigate, Sam pushes the employment contract in front of him and demands he sign it. Stunned, he complies, and Sam is officially employed only to discover that it is the murder of her new boss causing all the screams.<br /><br />Thus, begins a dangerous adventure for Samantha Darling. She delights in solving a mystery. Unlike some heroines of mystery novels, she had two advantages: (1) Her brother Rob is a cop. Perhaps, he will give Sam some inside Information, and (2) Sam is more than a little psychic in that she feels faint when she is near “evil.”<br /><br />These advantages could come in handy during Sam’s search for the murderer of her new boss, but there are two problems Samantha must overcome. Her brother won’t share police information.  And her psychic powers don’t consistently speak the truth.<br /><br />Be that as it may, Sam can always rely on her dog Clancy to serve as her sounding board. With him, she can discuss not only the case but also her personal problems, especially the one that has haunted her since her senior year in high school.",Kindle_Store

Raved about it. Gave it all the possible stars, then ran eagerly to get another book by her.<br />Okay, the concept is interesting. The overbearing mother is interfering with the daughter's relationship with her boyfriend, so Mac, the daughter, decides to find her mother a significant other of her own.<br />The characters are awful people. Mac is judgemental and whiny. She 'interviews' each guy on a first date to see if she thinks they're good enough for her witch of a mother. And her mother is obnoxious. She constantly denigrates Dan, Mac's boyfriend, who is the only good person here. Most of Mac's interviews/dates are horrifying and not in a funny way. She's a mean girl, just like her mother, without an ounce of compassion. She thinks nothing of using Dan's credit card to buy a 100 quid bottle of champagne for one of her mother's dates without bothering to ask and while she's agreeing with her mother about Dan's imagined deficiencies. This was so not a feel-good romantic comedy, at least for me. However, it is the author's first book, I guess, and she wrote such a lovely book after this. I advised you to skip this one and move onto The Little Bookshop of Love Stories.",Kindle_Store

5,B009NVU192,2018-04-27 15:51:06.671,Wonderful! Read the entire series of five books. Must Read. If you want a panoramic view of what happened to Israel after King Solomon built the temple. This series starts with King Ahaz and ends with Mannasah his grandson.  The author uses the scriptures and other historical documents to weave a story that both convicts and redeems as the children of God sin and we view God's punishments and ultimate forgiveness. The author uses her own words to describe what is happening  in such a way that it brings such vibrancy that you are projected to that time.,Kindle_Store

I don't see a romance here; I see a dysfunctional codependent relationship between Mackenzie and her mother Eleanor. I don't care for profanity in stories but in this rare instance I feel the author used it to give an effective portrayal of the frustration Dan experiences dealing with Eleanor and her relationships with Mackenzie and himself.  The book contains crude sexual references but no sexual descriptions.  Readers looking for something ""steamy"" will not find it here.  Readers who have little tolerance for ""good guys"" who are whining, codependent, manipulative and spiteful will probably not enjoy the story that much.",Kindle_Store

This is a review of the magazine and NOT the subscription through Amazon.<br /><br />I had subscribed to Sunset several times over the years.

Fast forward nearly 40 years and I'm back on the Pacific side of the country where Sunset actually matters to me now.<br /><br />I've always like their writing.  It's an easy comfortable read without dummying it down so much I feel as though I'm being talked through instead of to.  Their articles seem to hit home for me.  Being an avid hiker, camper and backpacker (as well as retired chef), there seems to be many choices that speak directly TO me.<br /><br />Sunset magazine isn't going to shake up the world.

The spreads have also been super saturated lately. The size is super cute and handy.<br /><br />cons: no one would wear this stuff. The ads and the strange combinations of clothing articles contrast greatly. They make those poor girls wear the strangest things. I suspect some of the pairings are completely random and last minute. The writing is very simple. The articles are a rehash of teen issues that have been going on for decades.

A few great new pics of the boys (Donna and Keith are conspicuously downplayed) but you've probably seen many or most of the photos in this issue before. What you might not have seen are lots of images of posters advertising old Dead shows plus tickets, album covers and other Dead-related art. Most of the text also covers familiar ground but there were some bits about origin of the skull and roses imagery and a reveal about Dick's Picks and Dave's Picks that was new to me.  Some folks are misidentified in a few photos in the text and there are a few errors (calling Jack Straw a Garcia-Hunter tune).  Way overpriced at $15, but for baby boomer Deadheads like me, how do you pass up a 50th Anniversary special edition on the Dead?

5,B0040VGZSG,2015-07-08 22:45:30.000,"Best sawing and fashion magazine, ever. I have learned sewing from this magazine, and I find it excellent.  Not only you get about 50 patterns for about $8 per month, but you also get an advance preview of fashion trends to come. This magazine is one to two years ahead of the fashion trends, and it has a beautiful, sophisticated but simple style.<br /><br />The instructions are excellent. Not as detailed as if you buy a pattern separately, but they include extras that you usually don't have in pattern booklets: detailed technical diagrams, list of notions, and cutting layouts.  I find those indispensable and wish they had them in packaged patterns.<br /><br />One drawback is the time you have to spend to copy the patterns from the pattern sheet.

5,B0040VGZSG,2014-01-22 06:43:41.000,"One of my top 3 favorite publications. I'm a home sewer who loves fashion forward clothing that is well-made and not super expensive. I first subscribed to this publication about 10 years ago.  This magazine is like getting a great fashion magazine with the patterns included instead of merely a pile of ads.<br /><br />It used to be harder to use the patterns in the English edition as they didn't include any of the detailed sewing instructions typical of an individually purchased sewing pattern, and the pattern markings were all in German. However, the current version includes helpful tips in every issue that over time will give a home sewer a good amount of technique for clothing construction and other projects.  You effectively get the value of more than $100 (USD) worth of patterns in every issue!  This edition includes mainly misses, some women's plus sizes and a few patterns for men and children in every issue.  They also have a &#34;plus&#34; edition in English which I also purchase as the regular issues are mainly filled with &#34;skinny&#34; sizes that quite a large percentage of American women cannot squeeze with our curves.  If you learn to redraft the patterns that must be traced anyway, this edition will give your far more original patterns for your money than the plus edition which seems to use 3 variations on the same basic pattern (shirt, dress, jacket for instance) and list it as if it is a completely different pattern instead of a typical pattern envelope that shows it as views A, B, C when only minimal style differences are done such as collar or hemline variations.<br /><br />This edition includes a few tall designs and a few petites as well.<br /><br />I'm still not a huge fan of the &#34;extra&#34; craft projects that are included like lampshades and other &#34;homemade&#34; looking things like decorating an old wine bottle or mirror.  There are many craft magazines and womens magazines that do that little craft stuff better and in more depth.  I wish they would take that out and include more sewing techniques or details about the individual garment patterns that are included or even another article about a designer or talented reader.",Magazine_Subscriptions

I'm a long-time subscriber to the magazine, but have joined many other readers in noticing its drift away from the genre of its own title. While ""Art of the West"" and ""Western Art Collector"" both maintain a strong focus on true western art, ""Southwest Art"" is becoming more generalized in its content, overlapping ""Art in America"" significantly. There are always a few pages of true southwestern art, but the vast majority of the magazine features cityscapes, floral still lifes, ballerinas and dancers, seascapes and boats, roads, etc. In fact, most of the glimpses of actual southwestern art (mountains, Indians, cowboys, buffalo/elk-style wildlife) are found not in the magazine's content, but in the advertisement images.

The recipes are not worth the price of the subscription and there is not enough left in the issues about Cal to make it fun to even page through.

My Amazon account said my subscription was valid through April 2022, but I just received a reminder notice from the publisher that my subscription expired. I contacted Amazon, who told me to contact the publisher, who told me to contact Amazon's subscription agent. After being put on hold with them for five minutes in complete silence, I hung up.

To my surprise, the ratings aren't reflective of my love for this magazine.<br /><br />True that the magazine is for those who have money but isn't this implied?  If you're struggling to make ends meat, is traveling for leisure really at the top of your priority list?  I'd hate to be downright blatant here but for those who are lowering the ratings of this magazine for that reason, your complaint really has no bearing on the contents of this magazine.<br /><br />Here was my take on the magazine:<br />- I really enjoyed it because it wasn't all about travel.  As the name implies, there's other aspects to this magazine as well including design and other lifestyle related information<br />- The magazine does list more expensive hotels and spots that they recommend but isn't that sometimes part of being 5-star?<br />- There were a normal amount of advertisements, nothing too extreme<br />- The articles were relevant and informative<br /><br />For those travel enthusiasts who are curious about what more is out there like myself but want to also read about design, culture, and other lifestyle related information - this is for you.<br /><br />If you're looking for a magazine that's all about travel, cheap deals, and how to save money on travel - look elsewhere.",Magazine_Subscriptions

Every month I look forward to reading through the recipes and picking a few to try.

However, I feel that their accent on gardening/outdoors/architecture for helpful info, beauty's and enjoyment's basic sake is taking a backseat to wines and fancy foods. It seems that with every issue, they up the percentage on coverage of those two elements. For me, that's too bad, while, I'm sure others will think that's just fine.

1,B07GSH3YSW,2019-12-23 12:19:11.311,"Shame On MUFON. I used to actually have respect for this organization prior to watching a few episodes of this ridiculous TV series. This is the kind of stuff that gives UFO research a bad name and completely shreds any credibility that MUFON had prior to the series premiering. It is a pure sell-out, with any real research being completely thrown-away and replaced with sensationalism and mindless entertainment.<br /><br />The series goes well beyond the kind of ridiculous speculation that you will find in the Ancient Aliens TV series, which is just a bunch of mindless garbage. In this series MUFON seems to intentionally misquote and misrepresent countless facts that are well known in the UFO research community. Like the Ancient Aliens series it also features interviews with fringe ""UFO experts"" who few, if any, take seriously. They seem to just spew forth a bunch of baseless ""facts"" that are based on nothing but crazy speculation or rumors. The few facts they do happen to bring up are easily lost in the 99% BS they are telling us.<br /><br />About the only UFO researcher that I have seen in these episodes that has any credibility is Richard Dolan and the few, brief clips they show of him seem to indicate that they are largely quoting him out of context and have edited his sound bytes in such a way as to twist their meaning. I am pretty sure that if Dolan had any editorial say in the series that he would never have allowed these interviews with him to be aired.<br /><br />In one episode in particular there is some MUFON staff member claiming that the Iranians probably used reverse engineered UFO technology in order to capture a drone operated by the United States. This has to be one of the most ridiculous and laughable claims I have ever seen from a supposed ""UFO expert"". The Iranians had no need for UFO technology to accomplish this. It's well known that the only technology needed to capture a drone such as this is to jam it's GPS receiver with a high-powered transmitter that tricks the drone into thinking that it is somewhere that it is not. You can literally buy off the shelf hardware on Amazon to accomplish the same thing. The military and Secret Service have been using the same technology for years to guard against drone attacks.<br /><br />Another laughable claim made by MUFON is that the invention of the transistor was a result of captured UFO technology. The history of the invention of the transistor is one of the most well documented of all inventions made during the 20th century and was a logical technological advance that was simply an improvement over the vacuum tube. The transistor is already basically obsolete as a piece of technology in the 21st century as it has been long replaced by the integrated circuit. Yet, MUFON would have you believe that aliens were using this obsolete technology to run their spacecraft?<br /><br />There are so many inaccuracies, misleading statements and flat out lies in these episodes that none of them can be taken seriously. I'm not sure how much direct control that MUFON had over the content, but since they have not come out and outright denounced the series I am assuming that they are o.k. with it. As such, I can never take anything that MUFON says seriously ever again.",Movies_and_TV

4,B0000B1A1J,2008-02-18 20:06:33.000,"Grotesque, Macabre, and Extremely Influential Silent Classic. Like most artistic ""isms,"" expressionism is somewhat difficult to define; in general, however, it refers to a style in which the artist is much less interested in capturing external realities than in portraying emotional and psychological states; consequently, expressionism is often fantastic in a visual sense--and when it combined with the darker edges of Germanic folklore it gave rise to a series of classic and near-classic silent films, including THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI, NOSFERATU, THE GOLEM, and WAXWORKS.<br /><br />Over time, the style began to creep into American film.  This was most particularly true of films made at Universal Studios, which had major successes with such gothic-inflected films as THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, both of which starred Lon Chaney.  Drawn from a minor work by Victor Hugo, THE MAN WHO LAUGHS was first intended as a Chaney vehicle; by the time it began production, however, Chaney had decamped to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer--and Universal assigned Conrad Veidt to the starring role under director Paul Leni.  Both men had been deeply involved in the German expressionist movement, and the resulting film was a melodrama so deeply steeped in the grotesque that it came to be regarded as a horror film.<br /><br />THE MAN WHO LAUGHS concerns a child named Gwynplaine who is caught up in royal intrigue and is deliberately disfigured, his mouth cut into a ghastly, inflexible grin.  Abandoned, he rescues an blind infant girl; both are taken in by the kindly Ursus (Cesare Gravina.)  Years later, and entirely unaware of his aristocratic origin, Gwynplaine (Veidt) and the beautiful blind maiden Dea (Mary Philbin) are popular carnival actors, appearing in a play written by Ursus--but although he loves Dea, Gwynplaine is deeply humiliated by his eternal grin and feels he can never marry.  Ironically, it is not until he is once more caught up in a royal powerplay and recognized as a peer that he realizes the depth of Dea's love.<br /><br />In some ways the plot is simplistic and occasionally too much so, but the look of the thing is relentlessly fascinating.  Director Leni endows his world with grotesque faces, vulgar sexuality, and deliberately twisted visuals--particularly so in the first half of the film, which is greatly famous for the sequence in which the abandoned child stumbles through a snow storm beneath gallows bearing rotting corpses to find the infant Dea.  Veidt's hideous grin, an early creation by make up genius Jack Pierce, is remarkably effective; the performances are memorable, and although the second half of the film is excessively predictable the whole thing goes off with a bang.<br /><br />Although it was hardly a failure, in 1928 THE MAN WHO LAUGHS proved too gruesome for many audiences, and the rise of sound films drove it into a too-rapid obscurity.  Even so, it would cast a very long shadow: it is an important link in the chain between German expressionism and the great Hollywood horror classics of the early 1930s.  The Kino DVD presents a reasonable but far from flawless transfer of the film, along with several bonus features, most significantly a ""making of"" documentary that details the film's stylistic importance.  Recommended for fans of classic horror.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Movies_and_TV

There was no backstory or history of this tribe and how they came together and the philosophy that was vacant and empty and just hollow words about being on your own path and some lost in translation message about ecoterrorism. There was no joy, it was just going through the motions.

Yes, the original was a great movie and &#34;didn't need to be remade&#34;.  Yes, this movie is short on plot and character development - and chemistry.  Yes, this movie makes no sense - and it doesn't have any of the &#34;spiritual values&#34; of the original (through it pretends too).  And I don't like the hard sell on tattoos, which are ridiculous and prohibited in the Old Testament.  BUT ...<br /><br />This movie is fantastic.  Never a dull moment.  Some marginal CGI, but still the stunts were super exciting.  The rock climbing was almost unbearable to watch.  I don't know how they filmed that or how much of it was fake - but it looked very real.  The last scene was great, but there were many great scenes, including the motorcycle riding at the start.<br /><br />I didn't like the female star.  She was too tall to be an extreme athlete.  He breast implants looked (and I'm sure felt) ridiculous.  Her tattoos were disgusting - and I knew that was her in the gondola - good riddance.  Bhodie was good.  The star was good.  Nothing great, but good enough.  The British guy was useless.  They should have killed him liked they killed Nolte.<br /><br />Still, I highly, very highly, recommend this movie.  Awesome.  Not as clever or compelling as the original, but nearly as exciting.  It's hard to beat the combo of Reeves and Swayze, so this didn't try.  But it succeeded on its own terms.  Fantastic.<br /><br />BTW - Another good action movie is &#34;Unstoppable&#34;, with Denzel.",Movies_and_TV

It's sad to understand that Miss Bledel, who came close to the title of &#34;America's Sweetheart&#34; on the &#34;Gilmore Girls,&#34; is now forced to accept roles in tripe like this.

Yawn, another &#34;found footage&#34; flick. the Found-Footage genre is usually a cop-out for justifying bad cinematography and this is no exception. However, This director has found an additional cop-out. The creature's energy-field disrupts the video images when it comes near - consequently, there is no need to worry about special-effects or make up. The result is that an attack by the creature is simply accomplished by shaking the camera about for a few seconds. However, this was the only spark of creativity apparent in this disaster. Finally, the actors were as close to generic as you could get. Mr. Baxter may have done better if he called the computer-graphics store and ordered the cast - one pretty brunette, straight hair, lots of make up etc. The acting was that stiff. Wish that I could think of something good to say, but there is absolutely nothing here. My condolences to the investors.",Movies_and_TV
5,B016DMXW1W,2017-10-16 02:43:57.169,"A Day In Alien Valley. I'm giving this film 5 stars simply because I do not think many other people who are giving it bad reviews really &#34;get&#34; this film.  It is the PERFECT example of what all those &#34;reality/ghost hunting shows&#34; really are. I would not call this a &#34;parody,&#34; I would call it a film that &#34;calls out&#34; the entire genre of ghost hunting/paranormal programing for what it is.<br /><br />Having said that, I need to admit that I love &#34;found footage&#34; films. This is by far one of the better ones out there and certainly worth a free viewing on Amazon Prime. The actors are pretty good, considering their job as actors is to portray a bunch of dimwitted reality paranormal stars (except for the ranger, she was pretty terrible - but maybe the actress really nailed what a lone, rookie ranger would act like...who knows). They seem to hit the mark &#34;dead-on&#34; most of the time. You will certainly recognize some of the &#34;famous stars&#34; of the paranormal genre that they are meant to be representing. However, what makes these folks great actors is that they make you care about their characters WAY MORE than you should ever care about any real reality paranormal &#34;star.&#34;<br /><br />Loved the setting, loved the story/premise and loved the delivery. This is actually something that you could see spinning out of a paranormal reality show...that is, if any of the alien stuff is actually real. Still not sure why this film is getting so much hate. It deserves a few fresh eyes and some fresh reviews because it is way better than many are claiming. A fun way to kill an hour and a half.",Movies_and_TV
3,B000KFMN6Y,2015-03-08 18:47:09.000,"Caesar Burned the Library??!! *** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />I have watched this film several times and finally appreciated the witty dialog. Shaw sets a precedent for more modern phrases and lights up the B&W screen with audacity and welcome intrigue.<br /><br />Beautiful vixen Vivien resorts many times to her impish Scarlett character and found this most annoying but loved the interplay with Claude. He made Caesar playful, powerful, and poignant. How could they have murdered him? History is told much more affectionately in this version and it is a treat. Many are offended by the inaccuracies, but if you know the difference the offense is lessened.<br /><br />I think the horrendous burning of the Alexandria Library allowed by Caesar was the most difficult to comprehend given his appreciation of learning, literature, and history. This just did not make sense and wondered how Shaw got this all wrong, unless there is some factual aspect I am unaware.<br /><br />Robson was unforgettable as the Chief Medical slave and remembered her in &#34;Withering Heights&#34; and &#34;Fire Over England&#34;, such versatility!

Even for an actor as talented as the immortal Conrad Veidt, The Man Who Laughs is an amazing achievement.<br /><br />Throughout his portrayal of course he has to wear the ever present smile while responding to a range of emotions, needless to say, for most of which a smile is definately not appropriate.<br /><br />So wearing that smile we of course see Veidt cry but we also see him combatant and empathetic and even disapproving all while having the same look on his face from the nose down.<br /><br />If this were merely a movie depicting Veidt's estimable range I think it would be largely forgettable.<br /><br />What makes this movie truly astounding though is the skillway in which Veidt's range of emotions is so properly brought into play as the story develops.  In a flashback we see the making of the man who laughs, essentially a cruel prank pulled on the son of an enemy of the King.  As he grows we watch him ripen into a mature man.  Ostensibly a side show freak, the man who laughs repeatedly earns our empathy and sympathy in much the same way the title character of the Elephant Man does in the play of that same name.<br /><br />At the end however and in a departure from Victor Hugo's original story, we see the triumph of the man who laughs who at last ironically is able to wear his artificial smile genuinely.<br /><br />Orson Wells used to say that it only takes one masterpiece to enshrine one's name to history.  If this were Veidt's only film, it would certainly qualify as his.  But by the time this movie was made he'd already had so many masterpieces to his credit including Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, the Hands of Orlac and of course Waxworks.  This isn't even including masterpieces he would yet produce including his role in Theif of Bagdad (British spelling) and of course as Major Stassser in Casablanca.",Movies_and_TV

3,B07GSH3YSW,2019-02-06 06:24:47.622,"Interesting new to me info. I grew up loving this stuff and really believing having seen weird stuff in rural NC MTS and FL. We watched Project Blue Book as a family each week and even Daddy watched which was strange because he absolutely didn't believe in any ""Supernatural"" occurrence. The rest of us did. We had seen things as I said. However, as I grew older and learned more and more about space having an engineering family inc my own kids I started believing that yes, something was being experienced and no, it probably wasn't extra terrestrial. I thought this is perfect spin in both directions to make us question alien existence while everyone develops space capabilities of the time and now better aircraft for surveillance and defense or offence. I do have a very high up friend who was in Vietnam and in the Air Force training and development. He categorically denies the military has been developing any of these things or the possibility of aliens but this is exactly what his security clearance would require. I don't deny the possibility of life on other planets or moons but just the ""bump"" we encountered when the first craft we sent out passed out of the solar system (I think of it as a gravity well sort of record groove idea to keep things in shape and place) makes it hard to overcome something coming in from another part of the galaxy. However, anything is possible. I mean we don't understand even 1% of all possible knowledge available to us or even use all our brains so who can say for certain? All we can do is make an educated guess. I expect them to find evidence of life in the solar system besides us but breaking the light barrier? We DID break the sound barrier and there are worm holes and possibly other universes and I am a Christian but my Provost at a major college isn't and we both have no idea why all that matter was there in a tiny speck to begin with. Boggles the mind. So never say never but I believe God created whatever we find so there isn't anything to see as unnatural or to make us disbelieve. Even if you believe in no God it is still out there created the same as everything else so nothing is weird, just new. Nothing negates our beliefs in other words. Plus to me it is fun. I am a tail end Baby Boomer and so a Space Age kid. Imagine how fun it would be in the 50's to read all those comic books kids were obsessed with. This is just fun to watch and I am sure there is something to some of it. The episode 2 guy doesn't blink and has a ""chest spread"" cut ie HEART OPERATION scar. LOL. I think maybe he had some mental issues but I believe they have experimented on putting suggestions of UFOs into personnel and how anyone missed all the space race sightings and the development of aircraft for military is beyond me. If you watch space race films you can easily see how someone would mistake these things for UFOs or how the military could use our gullibility to make us believe all this new military development is really related to alien beings. If you do ever show me a for certain space craft and aliens not from this planet I would be the first one to accept it, though. As I said, we don't know even 1% of all possible knowledge according to one of the experts in planetary science today. A lot of this is new to me. I have APS and strokes at 56 yrs old so I could have seen all this before and not remember. It is fun to watch at any rate. I certainly never want an encounter.

The FBI agent is a former dirt bike daredevil who gets someobne killed in a stunt then becomes an FBI agent because....?

Ok I will say I think it is highly disrespectful for then to be remaking all of Patrick Swayzes movies 7 years after watching him suffer and die from cancer.  He was a brilliant actor.  One of my favorites.<br />  Ok my unbiased opinion on the new Point Break.  This is not the same story.  Oh it has its similarities and a quick shot of them in dead president masks but that's not even much of an issue.  It's about a thing called &#34;the 8&#34;. It's not even a surfing movie.  (They could have saved themselves some bad reviews and named it &#34;the 8&#34;and changed some names.  Nobody would have connected them.  )This is not the Point Break you grew up with. It's got 2 surfing scenes in the movie.  It's a parachute suit, sky diving, rock climbing action movie in which the  crimes are justified in a Robin Hood kind of way.  Giving back more for the greater good with illegal means.  It's a good action movie with an interesting story.  There is no Tyler.  There's a girl named Samsara who is not like Tyler other than the fact that she understands Bohdi.  She's cute and isn't in it much.(she's no Lori Petty, she had the whole package)  He says outright how he is not doing this for enlightenment but atleast they didn't let you know that Bohdi is short for Bohdissatva because it would have made the guy look kind if silly seeing that Bohdissatva means enlightenment.  I really liked the new Johnny Utah.  I think he showed more of a back story where Keanu Reeves to me was more &#34;ok I'm here what to I do now&#34;  (oh I'm sure that's gonna piss some people off) I like back story and I like action movies.<br />In the end I give it four stars.

Instead of understanding the times, a lot of the information people would have known then would have made folks snort in derision at the nonsense offered here.<br /><br />For example, the first few minutes of the first episode tries to create a correlation between Eisenhower's dental emergency (listed in the public records for the time) with a drill at Edwards AFB (Simulating a nuclear attack, which shut down the base), saying in a conspiratorial tone, ""They happened at EXACTLY the same time!""<br /><br />Instead of explaining why these things happened at the same time (public records are available if anyone bothers to dig deeply enough, which obviously the makers of this rubbish did NOT want to share, or simply didn't do), they followed ""rumors"" that ""began circulating"" about Eisenhower meeting with Aliens.<br /><br />This was at the height of the UFO craze, so yeah, that kind of nonsense was going on ALL the time.  That doesn't mean anything actually happened of any ""alien"" nature.<br /><br />Were anyone to actually look at the possibilities of life on another planet coming secretly to an inhabited planet, let alone a President of the United States meeting them in secret, well, we're getting so close to zero as to make no difference.  Each step seems reasonable, but each step has a ""probability"", and as one adds steps, the probability goes down.<br /><br />To highlight how this works, let's say there's a 5% probability that technologically advanced aliens EVER EXISTED in the universe.  That's actually an exceptionally high chance, but this is an example.  Now, what's the probability they exist in our galaxy?  Lower than 5%, by several orders of magnitude, because there's only a 5% chance they ever existed among billions of galaxies.  Now, of those that might exist (the number has a lot of leading zeros, so the chances are exceptionally remote), how many of them have the capabilities of space travel from where they are, to where we are?  It's actually very possible (more possible than not), that there is only US in this entire galaxy who can even get into planetary orbit, let alone visit another planet in person.<br /><br />The odds of us being where we are seem ""certain"", but the fact is, we are a statistical fluke.  If the whole history of Earth were compressed into 24 hours, mankind would have come into existence (never mind advanced civilization) at 11:58:43 PM.  Civilization came in the last few seconds of that minute and 17 seconds (because the first ancestors of mankind evolved at 11:58:43, which include Australopithecus , Neanderthal and all of that).<br /><br />Against the vastness of the universe, and even our own galaxy, the likelihood that two alien civilizations even remotely capable of space travel meeting in PERSON, isn't zero percent chance, but it's so close to it that it would take a scanning electron microscope to get a hint that it wasn't.  Go look at the Drake equation sometime to see how it all works out.<br /><br />The point being, as a proponent of critical thinking and logic, I saw this series make a lot of assumptions, utterly ignore context and essentially feed into the mania of UFO ""believers"".  Reason, logic, and facts say there are no aliens, and none have visited Earth.  There is no evidence that isn't explained by something else, or that has more plausible explanations than ""aliens"".<br /><br />If you wish to be a true believer, that's your choice, but know that you're leaving critical thinking, logic and reason behind.  If you want to use this series as a learning tool for propagandist techniques (it's billed as a ""documentary"", but is fraught with logical fallacies and a biased agenda and you can see that in action here), then it's a very good way of learning how to decipher when someone is selling you ""fake news"" - or a bill of goods.  It's an excellent example of the use of innuendo and the improper use of correlation and cause and effect.  Correlation doesn't mean causation.<br /><br />An example of that is the infant survival rate of the Finns in the mid 1940's.  It went up dramatically when ""baby boxes"" were issued by the government to expectant mothers.  The post natal survival rate went from the mid 40% to over 85%.  But the boxes did nothing.  In order to GET a box, the government required pregnant women to see doctors regularly during their pregnancies.  THAT'S why infant survival rates doubled.  The boxes had nothing to do with it, other than an incentive to get women to see doctors.<br /><br />Much of the same kind of thing is offered here.  Just because two (or more) things happened, doesn't support alien visitation.  Each piece must be examined in context and with a critical eye.<br /><br />Extraordinary claims requires extraordinary evidence.  They completely miss the mark on that requirement, and string together a bunch of unrelated events to try to weave a picture in the minds of a viewer that flat out doesn't exist in real life.",Movies_and_TV

2,B000KFMN6Y,2011-06-22 14:19:46.000,"Shaw's Cleopatra. ""Caesar and Cleopatra"" is based on a play written by George Bernard Shaw in 1898. Shaw (1856-1950) was one of the greatest playwrights of all time, and the only person to ever win a Nobel Prize (1925) for Literature and an Oscar (1938). His plays include ""Candida"" (1894), ""The Devil's Disciple"" (1897), ""Man and Superman"" (1903), ""Don Juan in Hell"" (1903), ""Androcles and the Lion"" (1912), ""Pygmalion"" (1912), and ""Saint Joan"" (1923).<br /><br />The play's U.S. premiere was in 1925 and starred Lionel Atwill and Helen Hayes. This 1945 film was the first adaptation of his play for film, and Shaw helped adapt it for the screen. Bear in mind, this is a filmed version of a play, rather than a film about Caesar and Cleopatra.<br /><br />Vivien Leigh (1913-67) stars as Cleopatra. She is best known for her stunning performances in ""GWTW"" (1939) as Scarlett O'Hara and as Blanche Dubois in ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" (1951) - she won the Oscar both times. Eventually physical problems, a miscarriage, and the difficulty of living with husband Laurence Olivier would take their toll and she began a slow descent into madness, perhaps precipitated by the 326 performances as Dubois on stage in London followed by months filming the movie. Between 1955 and 1965 she made only 1 film, but she carried on with her theatre work and even won a Tony in 1963. Her last film appearance was in 1965 (""Ship of Fools"").<br /><br />Cleopatra has been the subject of many films, the most famous being the 1963 production starring Elizabeth Taylor. Other actors who played Cleopatra include Theda Bara (1917), Claudette Colbert (1934), Pauline Letts (1951), Rhonda Fleming (1953), Virginia Mayo (1957), Lynn Redgrave (1983), and Leonor Varela (1999).<br /><br />At the time of the film, Leigh was 32 years old, playing a teenage Cleopatra. In and of itself this isn't a problem, as many other actresses played the youthful Cleopatra when they were relatively long in the tooth (e.g., Elizabeth Taylor and Theda Bara were 31, Claudette Colbert was 34, and Virginia Mayo was 37). But all these other screen portrayals played Cleopatra as an adult, only Leigh tries to play her as a bouncy teenager.<br /><br />Claude Rains (1889-1967) co-stars as Caesar. Best remembered for his roles as ""The Invisible Man"" (1933) and Captain Renault opposite Humphrey Bogart in ""Casablanca"" (1942), Rains had a brilliant career including supporting roles as Prince John in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938), the evil Senator in ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939), Job Skeffinton in ""Mr. Skeffington"" (1941) and the politically astute Mr. Dryden in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962). Along the way he received 4 nominations as Best Supporting Actor. Bette Davis considered him the best actor she ever worked with.<br /><br />Caesar has been portrayed by Louis Calhern (1953), John Gavin (1960), Rex Harrison (1963), John Gielgud (1970), Timothy Dalton (1999), Klaus Maria Brandauer (2001) and Colm Feore (2005).<br /><br />Caesar was in his mid 50s when he met Cleopatra. Rains was the perfect age, as were most actors who played Caesar - Rex Harrison was 55, Brandauer was 57, and Calhern was 58. Only Gielguld at 66 was a bit old to be played Caesar.<br /><br />Flora Robson (1902-1984) appears as Cleopatra's nurse. She appeared in more than 50 films and was nominated for an Oscar for her role in ""Saratoga Trunk"" (1945).  Robson and Rains often worked together in films like ""The Sea Hawk"" (1940) and ""Elizabeth and Essex"" (1939) and she was paired with Leigh in ""Fire Over England"" (1937). Robson is funny in her over-the-top portrayal here.<br /><br />Gabriel Pascal (1894-1954) directed and produced. Pascal was known for his adaptations of Shaw's plays, including ""Pygmalion"" (1938) and ""Androlocles and the Lion"" (1952). It's Pascal who wanted to make Pygmalion into a musical, but Shaw objected, and it was only after Shaw's death that ""My Fair Lady"" (1956) appeared.<br /><br />The NY Times' Bosley Crowther said the film was ""an elegant spectacle"" with a ""remarkably entertaining cast."" He said the ""sets have a rich and regal splendor, his costumes have great exotic charm and his people who wear and populate them play the Shavian whim to the hilt.""<br /><br />1945 was not a banner year for films. The top grossing films were ""Mom and Dad"", ""The Bells of St. Mary's"", ""Leave Her to Heaven"", ""Spellbound"", and ""Anchors Aweigh."" The big Oscar and Golden Globe winner was ""The Lost Weekend"" (Picture, Director, Actor). Notable films released that year included Joan Crawford's Oscar winning ""Mildred Pierce"" and film noir classic ""Scarlett Street"".<br /><br />One of the problems with this film is that it is a filmed play, and not really a film. It would be better entitled ""George Bernard Shaw's Caesar and Cleopatra"" so that people understand they are going to watch a filmed version of a play, and not really a movie. Personally I don't find this a problem, as there is considerable worth in seeing a play on film. But some film goers may find this objectionable.<br />Another problem with this film in Leigh's attempt to be a bouncy teenager. As good an actress as she was, and she was a really good one, at 32 even she cannot convincingly be bouncy.<br /><br />Fans of Leigh will delight in  her portrayal, and for a woman in her 30s, she does do a great imitation of a bouncy teenager. And of course, Claude Rains is always good to watch. But be warned, this is a filmed play, and a play that is well out of date by today's standards, so unless you're prepared to accept this, you may be disappointed.",Movies_and_TV

5,B007OBZD4G,2014-07-07 17:30:26.000,"Rights, rights, and more rights. This is one of the most compelling TV dramas ever made.  But the reason it's not released on home video might go way beyond the ""music rights"" issues previously mentioned.<br /><br />Five years before COLD CASE even aired, CTV (Canadian TV network) released a series titled COLD SQUAD. And the producers of COLD SQUAD claim that COLD CASE is ""rip off"" of their series. Litigation is still ongoing on this matter. Meredith Stehm, the creator of COLD CASE, was present at a Canadian Film Centre meeting in 2002 where the concept of COLD SQUAD was discussed.  And a year after that, COLD CASE premiered.<br /><br />CTV's attorneys claim that Stehm used her knowledge of COLD SQUAD to invent a ""copycat"" series. And the lead attorney in CTV's legal team is Pierce O'Donnell ... the attorney who successfully represented Art Buchwald in his copyright infringment suit against Paramount Studios. He's also the attorney who represents the James Bond franchise against any ""copycat"" productions. So, CTV has some serious legal muscle. And the outcome of this litigation is anyone's guess.<br /><br />FWIW, I was able to find COLD CASE (seasons 1-7) DVDs through another online retailer.  Given what I've just said, and based on the shipping info given by the retailer, I'm relatively certain this set is a pirated Chinese knock-off.  But until the COLD SQUAD vs. COLD CASE litigation concludes, it's probably the only 7-season copy readily available now.  And even when litigation concludes, that doesn't mean a series DVD set will ever be released.  So, if I end up with a pirated product, my conscience is clear.",Movies_and_TV

The next time you are thinking about making another remake please watch Point Break 2015 again.<br /><br />Okay, where do I start? The bad casting. They put out a call for dirty looking guys with scraggly beards, greasy long hair, funny accents, and no personality. Then they covered them in ridiculous over done tattoos. And finally put them in one POINTLESS action sequence after another.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, I hated this movie beyond hate, but many of the action sequences were beautifully filmed. Clearly the director went to the Michael Bey school of filmmaking. Make it POINTLESS and pretty.<br /><br />There is one laughable scene where the boring as hell main character meets the two dimensional love interest and the couple decide to jump into the ocean off a yacht AT NIGHT, and play under water. Problem? Yeah, it was too bright! It was crystal clear and looked like it suddenly switched to daytime. And don't feed me that crap about lights from the yacht.<br /><br />Bottom line, this was just a bad movie. Watch the original, it's 1000 times better.",Movies_and_TV

It has little dialogue, the dialogue that is included is usually misconstrued as gibberish, nonsensical plot, breast shots at the strangest times, and lots of breaking bones.  There is at least an arm, a leg, a back, a neck, and countless wrists.  As for the nonsensical plot, Steven fights alongside his highschool football coach.  I don't know many football coaches who are proficient with automatic weapons.  However, the most important thing for any bad action flick is to make sure that the audience laughs throughout the entire film.  This, unlike Seagal's failure movie ""The Patriot,"" does exactly that.  The bad lines greatly support the movie in the accomplishment of this feat (refer to the title of this review).  All in all, ""Marked for Death"" is worth watching because it makes you laugh and you get to watch stuff die.",Movies_and_TV

There's some speculation about what might have happened when... That kind of thing.  But most is in the historical record.  Episode 2 concerns underground bases that contain UFOs and aliens.  That's a stretch on the face of it, but when they tell the story of Operation Highjump to suppress a Nazi base under Antarctic ice, it gets flaky.  Supposedly, the US Navy sent a fleet of 2 carrier groups to accomplish this.  THat's just ridiculous.  You don't need 2 aircraft carriers and associated ships to take on 1 isolated base of enemy combatants stuck under the ice in a location thousands of miles from their home; and you wouldn't send 2 carrier groups to the bottom of the world with a war about to happen.  It's just absurd, unbelievable.  In episode 3, the film goes absolutely, full-tilt loopy.  The Iranians transmitting photons to pull a drone from the sky?  Photons have momentum, so they will repel a target (very, very weakly), not attract it.  Extending their thesis that we pilfered alien technology to the invention of the transistor in the post-war era is woefully incomplete w.o. an explanation for the historical fact that the transistor (Oh, all right, a transistor.) was invented and developed at Bell Labs.  Yet none is given.  I'll give them some credit for including one physicist, a weakly dissenting voice amidst all of the woo woo.  I don't know if I can waste more time on another episode.  Too bad.

Yes, I was/am a big fan of the original, but this one delivered.  I thought the plot was better, the acting was better (Edgar Ramirez is someone to watch) and the script was better.  My biggest issue in the original is that all of the characters seemed to be reduced to two-dimensional portrayals.  In this one, that was not the case.  I really enjoyed the action sequences and the photography was amazing.  My only criticism was the music.  The orchestration was great, but the tunes chosen were awful. It was such watered-down pop.  I half-expected to hear an old REO Speedwagon power ballad thrown in the film.  The film-maker would have done well to have at least injected &quot;Seven and Seven Is&quot; in this version as an homage to the original, as well have included some heavier tracks.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this film really delivered on a number of levels.

Claude rains was superb but are we really to believe that Caesar was that mousy? These were Roman Soldiers and Barbarians use to taking what they wanted, period.

I wanted to give this five stars, but despite the added improvement of Zac Efron in the cast, it doesn't quite measure up to the Broadway musical that it's based on.  It's otherwise pretty terrific, but as usual with Hollywood adaptations of musicals, they've sacrificed box office names for people who can actually sing in several key roles. And the memory of Divine as Edna Turnblad will forever cast a long shadow on everyone else who attempts the role. John Travolta does his best and adds some nice touches, but still comes up short.

If you are looking for great extreme sports photography then this is for you, BUT if you are expecting anything like the original Utah and Bodie forget it. The director never gets any kind of character development going for a bunch of actors I never heard of. The story development is completely lacking and the characters never are developed to the point that we care about them. A utterly pale shadow of the original.

Steven Segal, the one actor who started out well enough and got worse, performs his best effort in martial arts choreography in this slow starting, but hard finishing action fair.  Is the movie any good?  Well, as an action movie, it delivers.  The soundtrack works surprisingly for this low budget yawn and the major actors provide solid performances.  Steven is believable as the hard hitting, bone breaking retired DEA agent John Hatcher.  Keith David is a solid side kick as old pal who cannot take the drug pushing Jamaican posse any longer.<br /><br />Basil Wallace is effective as the voodoo villain Scewface and brings the best performance to the table.  All in all, this movie is fun, for what it is, a piece to show off Steven Seagal's aikido talents.  The fight scene in the department store is entertaining and the last fights in the flick are some of Seagal's best ever. The movie is probably really only two stars, but the voodoo angle, strong performances, and martial arts fair make it a four star movie for those into this type of action genre.<br /><br />Silly moments do abide:  The car chase in downtown Chicago (it is not Chicago, because one notices palm trees in the background), is over the top and too long.

5,B00J2JAT2Y,2014-08-15 14:59:24.000,"An Easy Solution for Desktop Recording, Makes me wish I could Really Play Guitar. I love this solution.  I got it mostly because I was looking for a high quality computer microphone for an amateur audio book project.  My needs and knowledge were not extensive, and I have been very happy with this.  The set up was very easy, although it took a little bit of fumbling around with the controls and some getting used to the device taking over the sound on my Mac when I plugged it in.  So there was a little learning curve to feel like I was adept at using this.<br /><br />But what sold me on this kit was the quality of the sound I was getting from the microphone.  Again, I am not an audiophile, I just wanted to have a good, clear recording of some book readings for a gift, and I was amazed at the clarity and sharpness of the sound I got.  You may want to find a review from an actual audiophile for specific numbers or a highly critical, technical review.  But if you are a novice looking for an easy to set up, solution with great results, I fully endorse this.  I have used Yeti Microphones at work and I have been happy with them, and this seems to work as well, and far better than many of our multi thousand, built in AV systems.<br /><br />Another intriguing thing about this solution is that it is specialized for youtube guitar and Ukulele streamers.  I do not really play, but I do mess around with a guitar and hope to someday be able to play.  But I did try installing the guitar mic and play with mixing and I think this is a perfect all in one solution for anyone looking to post their Katy Perry cover songs.<br /><br />I have played with a few audio packages, currently using audacity as I think I figured it out for my purposes first.  And if I went through that much work to get an MP3 Codec, I'm definitely going to use it.  It seems like you can use it for any recording/editing software package.  The Sound Blaster software I found kind of complicated and fear that I am only using a small portion of it's capability, but I was able to do some simple stuff with it.  It seems robust and works to control the device itself, not to record.<br /><br />All in all, I couldn't be happier with Quality and ease of getting the bare minimum of functionality.  I am intimidated by all the options in the software, but I have time I guess.",Musical_Instruments

There home made frequently translates to amateurish, embarrassing and clumsy. This recording and streaming set is an easy was to add polish and panache to your productions.<br /><br />My first impression was positive. The set comes packaged in a foam padded box.  You do not need an engineering background to set up and use. Hardware connects to USB ports and the software is then downloaded from the manufacturer's website and installed. The R3 device itself is small and sleek. While it doesn't have a dizzying array of options, it has all you really need. There are four modes, karaoke, chat, broadcast and recording. The voice microphone adds impressive depth and the second mike is designed to clip on to a guitar.<br /><br />Ultimately, the litmus test is performance and this one excels. I recently attended a class and suggested to the instructor that she produce a CD containing her unique mix and meditation.  Her first effort was pathetic and failed to capture the beauty and essence of her work. I agreed to help and with this kit was able to produce a CD that did it justice.

5,B009AS1FLG,2013-01-25 13:58:36.000,"Portable, durable, and GREAT mic pre-amp. I wanted to find a device that let me record easily when at a gig, or just in my office. I did a LOT of research into devices that were USB only, even other ones that Focusrite sold. The main reason I picked this one was its versatility in being both iPad and USB compatible.<br /><br />The complaints about the iPad connector cable are valid - it's too stiff and short. I feel like I might accidently break it off if I'm not too careful. Why it uses a proprietary connector on the back of the unit, I'll never know. To combat the included 30-pin cable I bought a [[ASIN:B008M12J9Y $10 3ft 30-pin extension cable]], which seems to do the job nicely. The GarageBand software on the iPad is simple enough to use, and while it can only record one of the 2 input channels at a time, that's fine for what I expected. To record from a live sound-board, I just use the XLR input, set the gain (with the awesome colored halo ring), and save the recording as a mono track.<br /><br />Being small and solidly built, I've got no problem tossing this in the milk-crate with the rest of my cables and peddles.<br /><br />In regards to how it records when plugging into a computer via USB (an iMac in this case), it's even better than I expected. The GarageBand software on the Mac does have the ability to record both input channels at the time time. The on-board monitor volume and headphone is fantastic. I thought it only would play back what was being input at that moment, but it does more than that. It's a real monitor (the GarageBand software recognizes it's the monitor output), and when you have a multi-track recording that you're working on, the software allows you to pass back other tracks from the computer while recording a new track.<br /><br />For example, I recorded a track with just the guitar (track 1), I was using the 1/4"" input channel, and laid down that track. Then I created a second guitar track and recorded a second guitar part (headphones plugged into iTrack Solo) and I was able to hear both the current track I was recording, and the first track. Lastly, I plugged in a mic into the first input, and created a 3rd vocal only track. When I was singing, I was able to hear both guitar parts with the headphones still plugged into the iTrack Solo as well as my vocals recording in real-time. I wasn't expecting this level of capability, and was very impressed by the lack of any noticeable latency in both the backing tracks and the vocals I was recording with all 3 going at the same time.<br /><br />The last thing I want to mention is the XLR pre-amp. Focusrite has been making high-end professional recording equipment for a long time, and the thing they're most well-known for is the mic pre-amp. I have to say, it is spectacular. There is absolutely no noise (no hiss, or clicks) of any kind. The gain staging nobs with the color halos make it so easy to setup, it's almost too easy. The sound it captures is exactly what you expect, and you'll notice right away if you're using a low quality microphone. It definitely stands up to their reputation. Having 48v phantom power to use those top dollar condenser mics is also a really nice thing to have. The demos on their website show how simple it is to use. Once you start playing with it, you'll realize it is a really nice tool for a solo artist, or someone who wants high portability, but great sound quality.",Musical_Instruments

It looks very nice too, although I don't have a chance to keep it on display.",Musical_Instruments

I thought several times about buying a new Les Paul style guitar.  I looked in several brands and when I found one that I liked the price was expensive and I gave up.  Then I found the Squier Starcaster on Amazon and immediately fell in love.  The guitar is excellent.  I just lowered the strings as I like the strings closer to the neck.  I made an excellent purchase and I recommend it, especially if you play in church like I do.",Musical_Instruments

But where it excels is mids.  The quality is unparallel.  It feels better than listening to a live concert because each instrument is independent.  I didn't even realize that was causing me fatigue.

5,B00DBRA4UK,2012-10-15 15:58:36.000,"Great by itself, can be modded further. Pros: Clarity, looks, natural sound<br />Cons: Potential comfort issues, flat sound might turn some off, no 1/4'' to 1/8'' adaptor, needs amping<br /><br />Source:<br /><br />MacBook Pro->FiiO E7->Fostex T50RP<br /><br />Much thanks to Fostex for the review pair.<br /><br />Packaging<br /><br />No frills here. The T50RP come packaged in a cardboard box in-which the style seems a bit dated. There's nothing to catch the eye really. The color scheme I'm not a fan of, the red background displaying the black T50RP just doesn't appeal to me. T50RP is in big white letters on the front and below that is a quick blurb about the RP (regulated phase) technology which is patented by Fostex. I'll get more into that later though. On either side of the box it simply says ""Fostex Professional Headphones."" On the back some product information is given. Inside the T50RP are wrapped in plastic with a piece of paper which has some product information.<br /><br />As I said these are no frills. This doesn't bother me though as what really matters is the sound primarily. I do take points away from Fostex though for not including a Stereo to 1/8'' adaptor.<br /><br />Design and Build Quality<br /><br />Right away these things impressed me for build quality. They made my Superlux HD668b look like plastic toys and they feel more solid than my Audio Technica Ad900. I am very impressed. The cups are made of durable feeling plastic, the pads are soft pleather which are easily removed. The pads are much better quality than the 668b, not only are they more comfortable, but they look better built and stitched. Connected to the cups are bronze colored metal guides that allow the headphones to be adjusted up and down. Connecting both cups together is flat metal with a rubber Fostex imprinted headband around it. On the left cup there is a high quality looking and feeling locking removable 3.5''mm plug. The cable feels solid, not stiff at all and terminates to a thick professional feeling 1/4'' stereo plug.<br /><br />These definitely feel solidly built in every way. They have a nice heft to them that adds to the durable feeling. No creaks anywhere.<br /><br />When worn they feel nice on the ears. I found the 668b to clamp far too much, and the Ad900 to feel a bit loose. The T50RP feel perfect clamp wise and the pads are soft to keep comfy. The headband is my gripe though. These are heavy headphones and the rubber doesn't do a great job keeping the top of my head from feeling the metal bar it's surrounding. This causes discomfort on the top of my head for long listening sessions unfortunately. This can be easily modded though, which many users have been doing with much success.<br /><br />Overall these feel professional. The look, build quality and features are fantastic. The comfort is the only thing I can gripe about, thankfully it's an easy fix.<br /><br />Sound Quality<br /><br />These have been left burning in for at least 50 hours, more likely closer to 100 hours with music I personally listen to playing through them while at work and sleeping to give maximum amount of burn-in time.<br /><br />There's been a lot of hype about orthodynamic drivers lately, I'm personally not knowledgable enough on the subject to know what makes these different than dynamic drivers unfortunately, but these do present music differently than even the 668b, despite them both being studio monitors. Before I go further into the sound though I did mention Fostex's RP (regulated phase) technology, I'm also not highly knowledgable on what this means, but on the Fostex website they have this to say,<br /><br />Quote:<br />UNIQUE FOSTEX RP TECHNOLOGY<br />Key to the transparent sound reproduction is Fostex's Regulated Phase Technology, a proprietory transducer and diaphragm design that has earned Fostex more than twenty international patents and has been successfully applied to microphones, headphones and loudspeakers used and relied upon in professional and commercial sound installations worldwide.<br />This technology has been enhanced still further in a new RP Diaphragm (now standard across the range), which uses copper foil etched polyimide film to provide excellent resistance to high level input peaks of up to 3000mW (T50RP), ensuring an accurate sound regardless of the volume.<br /><br />I'm still not sure exactly what it is, but I will say these have the clearest background I've ever heard. I read in another review on these about the ""black background"" and wasn't really sure what the reviewer meant by that until I had put these on. There is basically no grain, the background simply doesn't exist, all your hearing is the music. I love that. It allows me to hear everything with the maximum clarity these drivers are able to provide, and I must say it makes a difference.<br /><br />Now onto the sound. Overall the sound won't appeal to everyone, these are after all studio monitors. That doesn't mean these aren't fun to listen to, but they certainly won't appeal to all. I do find myself reaching for these very often though despite owning my Ad900, while these have made my 668b obsolete. The sound is natural, fast, balanced, and spacious. There's not a huge soundstage, but the headphones have good instrument separation. As for speed, this is one of the key reasons many Ortho fans like their headphones, for the speed in which the drivers are able to present music in. I must say, I'm impressed. From fast paced drum and bass, to alternative rock, to metal, these things have kept up in every department. From 140bpm+ double bass in metal to guitar shredding, to fast triplets on the hi-hat I never feel behind.<br /><br />Since these are studio monitors, the goal is to, ideally, have a flat sound. I must say that these do a good job being balanced, though I feel that the mids are slightly above the rest. The highs do sound slightly rolled off, though I feel they're accurately presented. The lows are good, they have good impact and the extension is decent. I don't particularly feel the sub-bass, but I can hear it. The mid bass though has nice impact. The sound signature really works with any genre, but it doesn't stand out with any genre either. It's an inoffensive sound, but it doesn't overly impress either to my ears. Let's try it with some songs though!<br /><br />Rubblebucket - Came Out Of A Lady<br /><br />I chose this song because it absolutely gives any headphone a work out. From the funky bass line to the wonderful horn section, intimate vocals and huge energy, it makes a great song to test overall. First there's a lot going on here, no less than 4 different horns, a Roland Juno 60 synth, percussion, drums, bass, guitar and vocals. Never once did this song feel congested, I was able to pick out every instrument with clarity. The vocals are wonderfully intimate sounding, I've seen Rubblebucket live no less than 3 times and it sounds just as good through these headphones. The horns come through with excellent authority and clarity. The percussion and rhythm guitar are easily discerned despite being a little lower in the mix than the horns, I'm easily able to figure out what's being played and play it along with them. The synth has a nice warm fuzzy analog sound the Roland Juno is known for. The drums have a nice sound as well, the kick drum sounds wonderfully fantastic.<br /><br />Overall every instrument is very accurately represented. The song feels and sounds energetic and honestly it's hard to write this as I want to shake my rump along with the kicking melodies. For a song with a lot going on, which is rather fast paced, these headphones handle it with ease. Compared to my Ad900 the T50RP feels less energetic, but mores accurately represents the sound as the Ad900 lack some bass and are a bit brighter, which causes a focus more on the horns. Both headphones play these back fantastic though.<br /><br />Amon Tobin - The Lighthouse<br /><br />I chose this song because of the creepy atmosphere and chaotic sound it has. Those who've played Splinter Cell Chaos Theory have heard this soundtrack. The scratchy bassline is haunting. The various sound effects in the background and foreground are causing shivers. Everything sounds wonderful and clear so far, much better than I thought on my Ad900, which aren't particularly known for being the most clear headphone. The jagged cut up beats are hectic and the T50RP keeps up with ease while allowing the other sounds to be heard, rather than drowning them out like the Ad900 slightly do. Both headphones are equally as fast though, but it comes down to a more accurate sound in the T50RP vs a more energetic sound of the Ad900 again.<br /><br />James Blake - Limit To Your Love<br /><br />If you've read my past reviews you know I love this song to test for bass response because of the deep, fast, bass. James Blake's soulful vocals sound beautiful, the piano has a nice acoustic sound to it, both linger beautifully. When the bass comes in, the vocals and minimal drum line are actually slightly higher in the mix than the bass. It feels like the vocals and bass melody are sitting on top of the bass line actually. As if I were looking at an aquarium and the bass line were the hectic water and the vocals and bass are sitting on top of it. Now this is how I've always perceived this, but there seems to be clear separation here as if the bass wasn't strong enough to bleed into the vocals.<br /><br />On my Ad900 imagine the same perception, but the bass line splashing up into the vocals and drums getting them wet, slightly drowning them out. Yes, weird right? The Ad900 is actually more bass heavy than these for this track. The bass on both of these headphones is fast, the T50RP extends well and keeps up with the over 200BPM fluctuations in the bass, as fast as the Ad900, but the T50RP just doesn't have the authority unfortunately for me to feel it. The mid bass of the kick drum has more authority than on my Ad900 though. The Ad900 though actually rattle my ears on this, believe it or not.<br /><br />Though the T50RP portrays this song beautifully I feel that the bass is supposed to leak more into the vocals and absolutely rattle everything for symbolism purposes. For this song I actually prefer the Ad900, and for bass response at that.<br /><br />Feist - The Water<br /><br />I chose this as a sibilance test and to see how intimate the vocals would sound. Good news, no sibilance at all and holy cow, Feist's voice is giving me shivers. They sound absolutely beautifully smooth, as if I were in a small acoustically tuned room and Feist were singing in 20 feet in front of me. The stand up bass and piano sound beautifully haunting, but Feist's voice steals the show, especially as she belts out her notes. The Ad900 present Fest's voice a bit too shrill for me, so the T50RP wins here.<br /><br />Radiohead - Jigsaw Falling Into Place<br /><br />I chose this for some alternative rock. Great energy, great balance, the vocals sound intimate and smooth, the instruments have great separation and balance. I prefer my Ad900 because of the more energetic sound, the guitars sound more lively, but I'm definitely digging the T50RP on this song.<br /><br />Bob Marley & The Wailers - Is This Love<br /><br />Bob Marley had some amazing production value and the version I have is the Barry Diament re-master from 1990, arguably the best version of this and boy does it sound good. There's a decent amount of instruments and vocals in this, and everything sound beautifully mixed. Bass is hugely important for Reggae and unfortunately it sounds a bit flat here, the Ad900 had more authority actually. Overall though this song sounds great, very clear, I feel as if I'm in the studio with them.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />For the price these headphones are absolutely wonderful, especially if you consider modding them in-which there's a huge community for it. These cans stock have a fantastic accurate sound to them and I feel they should be in everyone's collection as a pair of flat headphones. My biggest complaint with these is the lack of authority in the sub-bass, I just couldn't feel it, but thankfully you can mod these to fix that if you're handy. These are quick headphones able to keep up with any music, seriously, try it. The ""black background"" is something I never would have understood until I heard these, but boy it makes my Ad900 sound grainy.<br /><br />Compared to the 668b, well there's no real comparison. Spend the extra money to buy the Fostex T50RP. You're getting better build quality, a bigger community and a slightly more detailed and clear sound. Compared to the Ad900 it's tough. Stock the T50RP just don't have the energy compared to the Ad900 and surprisingly the Ad900 has more sub-bass. Both are fast though. I'm sure I'll find myself reaching for both for different occasions though.<br /><br />Pick these up if you have the money and can find them, I don't think you'll be disappointed. One drawback though is that I do recommend an amp for it, my E7 can power them just fine though. I only consider this a drawback though because it's my belief that no sub $100 headphone should require an amp. Great offering Fostex, what an excellent intro to orthodynamics!",Musical_Instruments

The other reviews speak the truth: this is an astonishingly nice guitar for the price.<br /><br />Mine did require a bit of setup out of the box. Just the basics, though -- neck relief, action, and intonation. Once I got it dialed in, I couldn't believe how well it played. If I had to guess, getting the neck and fingerboard right took priority in the design of this guitar; it's the star of the show here. It's just a ton of fun to play.<br /><br />The fit and finish is also quite good. Sure, there are some fussy little details here and there that aren't perfect, but the glossy walnut finish and overall look are great.<br /><br />How does it sound, you ask? Pretty dang good, I'll have you know. I'd say it's somewhere between my Strat and my SG. It has a bit of the Fender ""twang"" to it, along with the beefiness humbuckers like to kick out, though it's much mellower than my SG (which is just plain rowdy).<br /><br />So, if you're looking for a nice, inexpensive guitar that's a bit different, or you've always wanted a semi-hollow body (like me), the Starcaster should be at the top of your list.

The lip edges of the reed plates had some very sharp ridges running across them. I am a hobby jeweler so I had the equipment to smooth these out. The harmonica would have been unplayable with these sharp edges. The alternative would have been to send the harmonica to Hohner to have them fix it. Also I gapped the reeds for better overblows, and adjusted them so they don't squeal on the overblows. So it could need some tweaking to get it to play the way you like.

5,B00J2JAT2Y,2014-08-11 20:52:11.000,"SoundBlaster R3 -- 24-Bit Stereo Recording USB Interface with Microphones and Cables. This device is one of the fastest and easiest ways to get your music recorded and on the internet. The SoundBlaster R3 is a USB recording interface that allows stereo recording, and comes with a vocal microphone, an acoustic guitar microphone, cables and software so there's nothing else you need.<br /><br />The software includes a sound editor and provides on-board effects such as EQ and reverb, among others. It's small, it's portable and it took me less than 10 minutes from opening the package to recorded music. The recording quality is fantastic (24-bit) and the interface is easy to use, even for someone just starting out in the world of digital recording.<br /><br />You do not need a sound card for this device, you just need an open USB port on your desktop or laptop and the software takes about 5 minutes to install. The input jacks (for instrument and vocal) are 1/8"" (3.5mm) and are the same kind of jacks that are on your MP3 or cell phone.<br /><br />You also have an input for headphones so you can hear yourself or a music track play while you record, just like the way the pros do it in the recording industry. The two round knobs on top are for reverb and for volume. You can also listen to a music track in your headphones, while you sing your vocals on a separate track, which is also very easy to do with this recorder and software.<br /><br />The software is very easy to use, even if you haven't used recording software. The interface is laid out in a manner that is easy to understand and comes with presets for karaoke (singing over music with friends) online chat (like Skype), broadcast (recording your own podcast) or studio recording (yourself, other people with or without instruments.)<br /><br />For acoustic guitar players, you do not need an acoustic pickup in your guitar to record, since the R3 comes with a high-quality microphone that attaches via its own clip. So you just clip it on, plug into the R3 and you are ready to record--it's that simple.<br /><br />Do you have an electric guitar? You can plug in your electric guitar (with a 1/4"" to 1/8"" adapter, not included) and use the Instrument line-in on the R3 to record. You will need to set the ""Mic Boost"" setting in the software to +30 dB, and turn on the EQ and lower the high-band to cut out some of the static from your pickups, but it works! There's also a level boost on the EQ, so don't forget about that either.<br /><br />Also, if you have a guitar effects pedal or board that supports a headphone out, you can also plug this in SoundBlaster R3 and record your amp and guitar effects, just remember to turn up the volume control on your effects board to get the full range of tones and effects. I have a Korg Pandora Stomp pedal and used the headphone out on it to record with the R3 - no amp necessary!<br /><br />There is sound editing software (Creative Wave Studio 7)  that comes with this is well if you want to use it for simple editing and multi-track recording. You can record from either the vocal mic, the instrument mic or record both at the same time.<br /><br />The R3 also supports recording in 24-bit, in stereo, at the highest rate of 96 kHz, which is well above CD quality recording (44.1 kHz) so don't think it won't give you the same quality recording as some of the other more expensive USB recorders out there.<br /><br />This is a another winner from Creative - It's a great all-in-one setup for someone looking to record pretty much anything they can think of. Like I said before, it comes with two microphones, the interface and cables. You might want to pick up a microphone stand if you don't have one already, since a mic stand is not included in this setup. However, they are some very low-cost mic stands on Amazon for 12-14 bucks so it's worth getting one if you want to record your vocals standing up while playing ;-)<br /><br />Note: The R3 is compatible with Windows 8 and 8.1 (including 64-bit)",Musical_Instruments

They're kind of a pain, if you drop one you'll likely have to reset the covers. If the cover gets knocked a little, the screw will be loose and fall out. But, I put up with it because I just like the feel of it, with the curved shape. They're a little stiff to bend, but they can be made to overblow nicely.

I look a bit like a co-pilot with them on.  Be sure to read the dimensions before buying.

5,B00J2JAT2Y,2014-09-09 14:27:27.000,"My own FAQ for you who might wonder what the Sound Blaster R3 is. When I first saw this product, I was a little bit confused what this product really was.  So I am writing my own FAQ style review to make you understand the basic feature of this product.<br /><br />1.  Is this a microphone or what?<br />Yes, it is a microphone system to record sound by using a USB connection to the computer.<br /><br />2. Is this a USB microphone?<br />No, the microphone itself is not for a USB connection. However the R3 system is connected to the computer and you hook the microphone (included) to the R3.<br /><br />3. What kind of microphones the R3 can use?<br />You can use any dynamic microphone with an XLR or a 1/8"" connection.<br /><br />4. What is a major benefit of the system?<br />You get very clear recording through the USB connection from the microphone and external sound sources.  Most notebook computers these days have an internal microphone and line-in port and the quality of those are not for the music or high quality voice recording<br /><br />5. Is there added benefit of the system other than the microphone with a USB setup?<br />Yes, it comes with a clip-on instrument microphone.  You can attach it to your guitar or any instrument you like.  And the R3 system can be a USB sound input for external audio sources including MP3 players etc.<br /><br />6. Can you mix MP3 tunes with your recording?<br />Yes, the R3 allows you to mix external sound sources like MP3 songs, wave files, etc.  You can use the included microphone and the clip-on microphone at the same time, too.<br /><br />7. Do you need a power source like an AC adapter?<br />No, the R3 gets its power from the USB connection.  The portable battery charging smartphones or USB devices also can work as a power source for the R3.<br /><br />8. Is it Mac compatible?<br />Yes, the R3 works for both PC and Mac.<br /><br />9. What kind of cables included with the R3?<br />An XLR female to 1/8"" (mono), a aux audio cable (1/8""), and a MicroUSB cable.<br /><br />10. What are two big knobs on the R3 do?<br />One in the right is for volume control and the left side one is for reverb effect control. The volume control knob can be used as a system volume control for your PC or Mac.<br /><br />11. Do I have to install software to make the R3 work?<br />No.  Without any installation of bundled software you need to download from the Creative site, the R3 still works fine.  For example, you can use the R3 on GarageBand (Mac) without any setup and the reverb effect works right away by rotating the knob.  You can use the R3 for your VoIP application like Skype.  The reverb effect works on any application.<br /><br />I hope that my own Q&A helps you to understand about the product.  As you can guess from the price, the R3 is not intended for the professional studio recording.  But the R3 can do a very clean recording.  I was satisfied with the quality of the recording and the big knobs to control the volume and the reverb effect were really helpful.  The packaging for the system was very good and the finish of the product including cables was top notch.  For your basic music recording need, the R3 will do a great job.  I have been using products from Sound Blaster for more than decades and they never disappointed me.  For its price, this is a great recording gear.",Musical_Instruments
5,B00J2JAT2Y,2014-09-11 20:18:07.000,"Great little portable system for recording live music. This unit is a great way for musicians and singers to make web-ready home recordings very quickly. Perhaps one of the neatest aspects of this system is how compact it is, with the recording device being smaller than the include microphone. This makes recording in close quarters very convenient. The sound quality is absolutely acceptable for this type of product, making it a great option for beginning performers who simply want a reliable way to record vocal, or a solo instrument, over a backing track (which can be added via mobile device). In other words, singer-guitarists are ideal, but I have used this to record horn solos over pre-existing backing tracks (i.e. practice play-along recordings). So don't make the mistake of thinking this for guitarists and/or vocalists only.<br /><br />The software is a simple download and has a relatively easy-to-use interface. The interface will allow the user to tweak the EQ and such, while the &#34;modes&#34; allow for singing on-line karaoke, chatting, broadcasting online, or recording off-line. The hardware, as easily seen in the photo, basically consists of a reverb dial (on the left side) and a playback volume dial (on the right side). There are two mic inputs on the front of the unit, along with a headphone jack. On the back of the unit there are line-out, line-in, and mobile-in jacks, plus a USB port. The USB connects to your computer or laptop and that's about all there is to it. You don't have to use the included microphone if you have something better or preferable, but it's nice to have one in the package. Acoustic players will love the clip-on guitar mic that is included.<br /><br />Note: DC power adapter is available separately.",Musical_Instruments

4,B08MH82HS8,2009-11-02 01:10:40.000,"Better than Bose. Since no one else has reviewed these headphones I thought I would give my input just to inform those interested. I am more of a home audio guy. I don't need to use headphones too often because I am a single guy and I can pretty much listen to whatever I want without worrying about bothering anyone. I have some high end stuff and consider myself to be a pretty discerning listener.<br />With that in mind, I would say these headphones are well worth the money. I didn't want to spend a fortune on headphones because I knew I wouldn't use them all the time but in the cases where I need a set of cans, I didn't want to have inferior audio that would just drive me nuts to listen to. I have heard better stuff but you have to pay twice as much, and in some cases ( like with anything Bose makes ) you would not be getting near the audio quality that these things have.<br />These are not really for someone who is looking to thump their brains out either. But if you want a pair of headphones that can handle jazz, classical, swing, and any other real music, these will not disappoint. Turn on some Jane Monheit and it sounds like she is whispering with her sweet voice into your ear. Terrifically detailed and comfortable, in this price range, you can't go wrong.",Musical_Instruments

Prior listening experience: Audio Technica ATH-M50, AKG K240 Studio<br /><br />My time with these headphones was limited, as I bought them for a friend who lives far away.<br /><br />Sound:<br />The overall sound signature isn't overly bassy or dark, but there is more bass than treble. Good imaging, sound feels like it emanates from nowhere as opposed to from two distinct spots over your ears. Soundstage is slightly better than most closed cans. Bass is really good and tight, though it rolls off a bit. Mids seem very slightly boomy. Very smooth treble. Isolates very well and little sound leakage.<br /><br />Build:<br />Heavy and sturdy. Feels like a tank. Mostly ABS construction. Metal headband with a rubber sleeve and no padding. Matte copper-finished yokes. Free-motion, non stepped headband adjustment.Pivoting earcup design helps ensure proper fit. Detachable 10-foot cable.<br /><br />Comfort:<br />Not very comfortable. Earpads are very soft and encompass your whole ear, and not overly heavy as to cause neck pain, but for a headphone this heavy to have an unpadded headband makes me wonder what Fostex was thinking. After about 20-ish minutes of listening the headband begins to feel like it's digging into the top of your head. It's very unpleasant and usually results in needing to remove the headphones.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Amazing build quality, very sturdy<br />*Isolates well<br />*Great sound quality out of an iPod, sounds many times better when properly amplified<br />*Sound quality rivals $600 headphones with proper modifications<br />*Stylish<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Headband is hard and unforgiving, I expected comfort to be better for a headphone of this caliber<br />*The detachment method for the cable could be far better<br />*Sometimes hard to adjust<br /><br />That sums up this review.

I mean really, why the heck did they make it so short?  That being said, I certainly wouldn't let that stop you from buying it.  It's so easy to use and it works on your MAC or PC, as well as the iPad.  It works great with Garageband, but will work with other software as well.  It has two channels, one for guitar, and one for vocals.  The vocal channel has phantom power for your mics.  The gain control is also well done, by using a ring of light around the gain controls that go from green to red if it goes to high.  I've noticed when using a guitar with active pups, you have to keep it pretty low.  it has a jack for headphones but you can also connect monitors as well.

4,B00145EVJ6,2012-07-29 22:51:22.000,"Good investment and good value. After hearing about how my friend shorted out half his DJ setup running off a generator, I decided to step up my surge protection.  His Briggs & Stratton generator (piece of $#@!) was putting out 160 volts because it had a bad voltage regulator. (That's whyt I use a Honda generator!)<br /><br />After some brief research, the Furman M-8DX seemed to be the best balance of quality and performance for the price and seems to be the industry standard in line conditioning and surge protection.  It is lightweight, yet seems solid in its construction. Voltmeter is dead-on accurate.  My outlet read 118v using a Fluke power meter and the Furman.<br /><br />It works well and does what it's supposed to do which is protect your equipment, but I can't give it a perfect score because...<br />1)  The &#34;Christmas light&#34; bulbs are difficult to remove if they ever need to be changed and the manual does not specify how.  Furman should have used LED lighting instead.<br />2)  The 6-foot power cord it comes with is too short.  No matter how close an outlet is to my DJ setup, I still have to use an extension cord.

4,B08MH82HS8,2010-01-02 23:05:34.000,"very bright. I am comparing these with two other sets...<br /><br />Logitech G35<br />Koss UR40<br />Shure SRH240<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />The G35 allows modification of Bass and Treble levels, so I boosted them as follows: bass: +9 treble: +9.<br />The RealTek HD Audio headphone jack was used for the other two sets with no sound modifications.<br />The G35 was tested in stereo mode (surround virtualization off). Now let's begin...<br /><br />Bass:<br />G35: 4 koss: 4.5 shure: 3.5<br />Clarity:<br />G35: 4 koss: 3.5 shure: 4.5<br />Brightness:<br />G35: 4 koss: 3 shure: 4.5<br />Comfort:<br />G35: 2.5 koss 4.5 shure 4.5<br />Construction:<br />G35: 4.5 koss: 3 shure: 4.5<br /><br />Now let's run the numbers...<br /><br />Value:<br />Logitech G35 - 19<br />Koss UR40 - 18.5<br />Shure SR240 - 21.5<br /><br />With bass and treble maxed out, the G35 has enough bass to satisfy and is tighter sounding than the UR40. The cord is thick, surrounded by a woven material, and feels like it would be very difficult to damage accidentally (short of yanking on it or kicking the USB plug). The headphones themselves seem very sturdy and the adjustment band is metal. With the phones against your head, they seem to hold fast and do not feel like they might slip down. The faux leather pads are cushy but lack the width and pressure distribution of the UR40 and SRH240. Considering that the G35 applies the most pressure around the ears, this can cause comfort issues with prolonged wear. I was able to minimize the discomfort by adjusting the phones downward so that they were pressing against the ears as little as possible. As long as your ears are not terribly large, you should be able to find a reasonably comfortable position. Make sure that if you play with the Voice Morphing Preview option found in the utility program, that you disable it when done, as left on it can cause a slight humming noise. The microphone has a flexible rubber arm that folds conveniently out of the way when not needed and I found the pickup quality to be fine. The voice morph is a gimmick more than useful, unless they decide to add better morphs in an update.<br /><br />The UR40 seems inherently biased toward the low end and gives the most impressive bass without modifications. Without comparing to other headphones, the sound is very acceptable. However, after listening to the G35 and SRH240, the UR40 sounds muddy in the highs and mids by comparison. I still like the sound, despite that, and it does have exceptional bass response. The deal breaker for me is the flimsy construction quality, despite a lifetime warranty. The entire thing is plastic and the joints that attach the phones to the adjustment bands look unnecessarily fragile. The cord is also on the short side and very thin. Despite appearing closed, the UR40 is vented and quite open to environmental sounds, which can be good or bad depending on what you want. The comfort mesh around the top is notorious for coming loose, thanks to being attached by flimsy little black rubber bands. If you don't mind being prepared to replace them sooner than other headphones, or plan on being careful, these deliver great lows and adequate overall sound for the price.<br /><br />If you are looking for a clear, bright sound with complimentary lows, the SRH240 delivers just that. The comfort level is on par with the UR40 but the build quality far surpasses it and feels very sturdy. Unlike the G35, it is less physically oppressive and does not apply as much pressure around the ears, which I appreciate. While not as heavy as the UR40, the bass is plentiful and compliments the overall sound very well. It is also a closed back design for good isolation.<br /><br />If you have access to an equalizer, such as the one found in iTunes, you can compensate for the weaknesses and enhance the strengths of each of these sets to get a great sound, as I am currently proving to myself. I could honestly pick any of these and be happy with the sound, so it's almost more a case of priorities.<br /><br />update:<br /><br />I have decided to go with the G35 as I really enjoy the tightness of the sound and the feature set. I decided it is worth sacrificing some long-term comfort over. I like being able to modify bass and treble at the driver level, as this gives me strong, punchy bass, plus clear highs and mids without needing to rely on a third party equalizer. I only ever plan to use these at the computer, so being restricted to USB was not much of a concern.",Musical_Instruments

4,B06VX6T3RG,2010-06-01 20:58:47.000,"Big Sound, Nice Bends. I have played harmonica, mainly blues style, for close to 45 years. But not professionally. I play alone, in my room, most of the time, along with my cd's. For the past year I have been playing with a guitarist and bass player at my church (I go to a very cool church, geared toward people in recovery). We have a blast playing gospel and blues and the folks seem to like it. During my youth I played the classic Marine Bands, in the usual keys (A, C, D, F, G). When I first started they were maybe $4 or $5. When your harp got bound up, you'd dip it in a glass of water, tap out the extra H2O, and it would play twice as loud, for a while, anyway. But the water--or beer, if you didn't have water--would have deleterious effects on the wooden combs of those harps. The wood would swell up and pooch out from the metal bars; sometimes I would actually take a razor blade and trim off the front of the comb. Reeds and other internal parts were always getting gunked up, too.<br /><br />One thing that was cool back in the late sixties and seventies was that we were not so paranoid or politically correct. You could actually go into a music store and, using your own lips, blow into a brand-new harp, just to try it out....and you didn't even have to buy it if you didn't want it! Now you can't get do that; you have to use the ""harmonica tester"" accordian device. Pardon the pun, but that whole thing ""sucks"" because the device can't bend notes.<br /><br />Twenty five years went by. I finally picked up a red plastic-combed Golden Melody a year or so ago, and I was really pleased with the sound, right out of the (red plastic, again!) box. This is a terrific harp! It's much louder, clearer, and sweeter than my old Marine Bands. Bending is real easy, warbling (moving your head/mouth rapidly from side to side as you blow or draw on a single note) is easier, the holes all take and give air equally, the rounded feel is a nice contrast to the sharp, squarish Marine Bands. You won't tear your lips on this instrument. It's ridiculous how expensive these things are now; I paid about $32 each for the essential five keys mentioned above. I haven't tried soaking them, mainly because I don't feel the need, and I'm nervous about screwing them up after spending all that money!<br /><br />I wish I would have had one of these when I first started. An outstanding choice. I'd love to try a Seidel or Turboharp or Lee Oskar, but for now I will stick with my Golden Melodies.",Musical_Instruments
5,B06VX6T3RG,2016-02-05 07:30:36.000,"Sweet, Sweet Sounds! Growing Up in the South, meant I was use to Seeing Harmonicas in Stores and People playing them about anywhere. They were Cheap in the 5 & Dime Stores, and they were Marine Bands made in Germany. I'm 62 years Old and of course things were cheap back in my childhood Days. A Harmonica could be bought for a Dollar or Two at the most. I play Guitar so I've always been into Music since I was around Six or Seven. I bought many Harmonicas as a child, learned a few simple little songs but couldn't really play, but the Harmonica kept my Interest, so as an Adult I decided to try again, and What a shock at the pricing. I started out again with the Cheaper Harmonicas, yes they still make the Harps for around Five Bucks, but they are not worth the effort. I know because I bought several trying to get the sound I heard in my Head to come through the Harp, but It just didn't sound right at all Until I broke Down, and really against better judgement Bought a Hohner Special 20 and a Hohner Marine Band. I thought the Price was way to High for a Harp, but Now I know Why they cost as they do, Man These Harps are Sweet, easy to blow, bend and have the rich and full sound I had in my head all these years. These are Top of the line and worth every penny. Buy One or two or three, You will not regret it at all. I wish I had bought these at the Start instead of the Cheap ones.

Phones showed up on time, I listened to them un-modded and was not impressed.  But I knew going in that I would need to mod them.  After lining the insides with felt, and loading the baffles with clay, they sounded better.  I then removed the felt and used adhesive craft foam to line the insides and covered 90% of the vents with the foam as well.  Then after adding a small square over the center rear of the driver and removing the felt from in front of the drivers they sound great.  I am driving them through a Fiio e7 from a macbook pro.  If Bass is what you are looking for, these are not for you.  If you are looking for a pair of cans that sound realistic and will let you hear a new side of your music, then take the plunge but expect to mod them it is a simple process.

This device is designed to allow you to input audio from multiple sources to your computer, mix it as you like and record it using whatever recording software you have.<br /><br />If all you need to record is voice input, you might be better of just getting a decent USB mike. The mike included here is not high end, but it's decent, and you can, of course replace the mike with whatever one you prefer. (It does come with a cable that will input from an XLR device.)<br /><br />But if you want to record, say, voice and an instrument and maybe even background music, all at the same time, this is an easy and fairly cost effective solution.<br /><br />It's not quite as easy as they seem to suggest, though. The instructions included show you how to set it up, but very little else. If you want to get the most use out of it, you have to download software from Creative's website, which allows you to adjust a range of settings, including the balance between the various inputs, before recording.<br /><br />I didn't find the software to be entirely intuitive, though. One thing I find annoying is that the program won't even turn on unless you have the Sound Blaster plugged in, and it doesn't recognize it right away. So, I'll plug it in, then try to load up the program, get an error message saying it doesn't detect an appropriate device and that it will shut down, and then have to restart the software to get it to work. I have also never been able to get the mixer to work. I can have both the voice mike and the instrument mike plugged in, and I click on the mixer tab, and both the &#34;Instrument Mic/Line-in&#34; and the &#34;Vocal Mic&#34; are greyed out so that I can't adjust their levels independently. One time I had it open and it did allow me to adjust the &#34;Vocal Mic&#34; level but not the &#34;Instrument&#34; level -- and I have no idea what I'd done differently that time. But I had both mikes plugged in and it didn't let me adjust their levels independently.<br /><br />I've also found that it works differently with different recording software. I can record audio from all sources just fine in Garage Band and iMovie (I'm on a Mac). But for some reason whenever I try to use this to record audio in Premiere Pro I just get interference patterns that sound awful. I've used several different input sources for recording audio tracks in Premiere Pro in the past and never had a problem -- I understand how to set the audio hardware input and outputs properly -- but in spite of several tries I haven't been able to get this device to work with Premiere Pro. For me, that's almost a deal breaker, since that's really the program I use the most, and almost only ever record audio as a voiceover track to video I've edited in Premiere Pro.<br /><br />I haven't tried it with any other recording software than Pre Pro, iMovie and GarageBand, so maybe it works just fine for most applications, but I find it to not be as intuitive or easy to use as the product description suggests. That disappoints me, since I've always been quite happy with Creative's products in the past -- including other products in the &#34;Sound Blaster&#34; line such as the fantastic Sound Blaster Roar speaker.

I got one of these from another source but have returned it for exchange because of the following issue:  when I record a track either with the ""Audio Recorder"" or ""Guitar Amp"" screens in Garageband on my iPad 3, iOS7, the recording is great. But once I toggle over to the multitrack view and attempt to play the recording just made, there is godawful distortion and the audio is completely unlistenable.  Here's the other part of this: I can use Apogee Jam guitar interface, and iRig Pre microphone interface and Garageband behaves as it should and I can play the multitrack view with no problems whatsoever. The Focusrite support folks suggested I do a backup of my iPad contents and then do a software restore but I opted to return the unit instead, since the Apogee and iRig both work perfectly with Garageband. So, I don't know if the unit is having a problem with iOS7 or I just happened to get a lemon but I'll find out when the new one comes next week.  If it works correctly, I'll update this review after doing a few recordings.

5,B00DBRA4UK,2013-06-01 18:28:51.000,"Easy Five Stars when modified. I am working up a review of these when modified but wanted to just drop a note here at Amazon before hand simply because I am so thoroughly impressed.<br /><br />I run the Sennheiser HD650 and AKG Q701.  I have done a fair bit of testing of higher end headphones including the Sennheiser HD800, Beyerdynamics T1 and Grado RS1 - along with lower lines in each of those brands.<br /><br />Reading Z. Mehrbach's review here on Amazon raised my curiosity.  Offline, I contacted Zach and picked up a couple of his modified ones and was not really expecting much.  In short, I was absolutely blown away by the quality. Interestingly, very clear headphones are usually fatiguing but not these. One of his unit in particular had the clarity that reminded me of the HD800 though without the HD's huge soundstage. (No other headphone I know of has the soundstage of the HD800 but at $1500, it is more than 10 times the price!)<br /><br />Given the price of these units, no question a hands down best buy if you can modify these or have someone do it for you.  If I was without my HD650 and had these, I would not feel that I got a second rate headphone experience.  The modified ones have an additional strap or padding added which makes this every bit as comfortable as my HD650.<br /><br />In short, I now understand why there's so much fuss about these and why people spend so much effort modifying them.  I don't think I've heard a higher performance to price pair of headphones.<br /><br />By the way, I am running these off stand alone dedicated USB DAC and also a dedicated headphone amp.

I thought maybe the people just had unrealistic expectations. However, when I started listening to my music on these headphones, I realized that the headphone truly under delivers on the bass front. My much smaller [[ASIN:B00001P4ZH Koss PortaPro  Headphones with Case]] had better bass than this monstrous thing. And although the highs and mids are pristine, the little bass I ended up getting on using the ""bass booster"" equalizer on my ipod touch 2G ruined the experience. Even the tiniest amount of bass is distorted and hollow instead of being nice and deep. So I'm putting these headphones on the facebook marketplace and Craigslist. I don't want it anymore.<br /><br />Pros: Made a separate section because the only pro I saw and bought the headphones for this very reason, is the way the connector/jack is reenforced with the cable.

As others have remarked, the mids and highs are superb.  They have a nice, clear, open sound on most music, which is what I value most.  I listen to classical and jazz mostly, but also an occasional rock or R&B song.  Which leads me to my sole criticism.<br /><br />I'm not a bass freak, I don't need the bass to be overwhelming, but I do want it to be nice and deep.  The bass on these is pretty clean, but it  doesn't go quite deep enough, it leaves me wanting a little more.  I'm afraid the longer I keep them, the more it's going to bug me.  So I'm going to return them and try something a little more expensive, in hopes of getting the mids and highs that I like, together with adequate depth in the bass.  Maybe the SRH440.<br /><br />I have only listened to these for an hour or so, but so far the fit and comfort are excellent.  The styling is also very nice.  Very, very nice headphones for the money.  If your budget is limited to the $50s, I highly recommend them.",Musical_Instruments

However, even with my microscopic handwriting, there isn't much room to write in the left side that shows the week. I have started to use that side only for personal reminders such as an event or birthdays, since you can only fit maybe 3 things max on each day. For me it's not enough for work tasks. On the right side is where I keep a to-do list of work tasks, along with other random lists/thoughts. There's plenty of space there! I was going to flip to the front of the monthly view and write a few events to help me keep track of events coming up, but the calendar view is only for reference. It's way too small to ever writing anything unless maybe you have a cryptic symbol system. I love the layout of the journal and think a weekly view is more productive for me. I would just go with a bigger size, either the large or XL for better functionality so I can actually write more in it. I'm pretty minimalist with what I write down in here but still don't have room for what I'd like to keep track of. I get the most usage out of the right hand side which is a blank lined page. I do have to note that I love the feel of the planner. The soft cover holds up and it lays open flat. I love the ribbon to hold your place and the pocket in the back is super functional.

I bought this presenter in anticipation of a presentation I was giving and wanted to be sure I had a working pointer that I was comfortable with.<br /><br />In terms of specific features...<br /><br />- The laser pointer: nice, bright green that is easily visible even on a white projector screen. The light is fairly collimated without much spread in most settings that I've pointed it in.<br /><br />- The build quality itself is... alright. The plastic seems a bit light and flimsy, but I suppose this thing doesn't need to be super durable. It's survived being in my daily bag without any problems thus far. The one thing that's a huge plus on this front is the magnetic USB dongle. This design is simply genius and allows you to keep the USB dongle secured and with the presenter.<br /><br />- The button functions work as advertised. I haven't had any trouble on my Mac after following the included instructions.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad to have bought this presenter. It works as advertised, the laser pointer is nice and bright and clearly visible for usual presentation settings, and the inclusion of the magnetic USB dongle is genius.

5,B012FBNVOI,2015-11-03 15:43:28.000,"Works well, meets all my needs, and with a few extra features thrown in. (UPDATED 2018.11.15). Let me start by saying that I'm a graduate student who needs to give presentations at least twice a semester, and that having to wander back to the computer terminal to do so every time I need to change the slide is a pet peeve of mine. Also that, because I already had a pointer/presenter (the [[ASIN:B000FPGP4U Kensington Wireless Presenter with Laser Pointer]]), my fellow graduate students were constantly borrowing it and wearing down its batteries. Because the laser pointer in my Kensington wasn't quite as bright as I wanted anyway (and my research uses a lot of red fluorescence so the laser pointer would occasionally get lost because it was so dim) to the point that my PI started making comments, I decided to go on the hunt for a green pointer/presenter.<br /><br />Eventually, I stumbled upon this one. I was nervous to buy this product given that it had so few reviews. However, the potential gains of a presenter with a green laser pointer that wasn't ridiculously expensive or plagued by numerous negative reviews (surprisingly hard to find) had me deciding to give it a whirl. It unfortunately arrived exactly a day late for my latest presentation, but I've tested it out with my computer and the system we normally use at my school for presentations.<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Presenter is light and easy to handle.<br />-The laser pointer itself is nice and bright. Fairly well-focused with not a whole lot of scatter. (taking into account that scatter is more noticeable with a green laser than red) MINOR EDIT (non-dated): as pointed out in the replies below, the technical term for this ""scatter"" is, in fact, ""speckle,"" as scatter is something different. What I am referring to in this note is the small haze of light that appears around the central point of the laser, making it appear more ""fuzzy"" and less defined.<br />-Range on the presenter is adequate. I stood on the far side of our presentation hall (at the front, not all the way at the back) and was still able to control the slides.<br />-Button control for presentations is easy and fairly intuitive. For those who don't know off the top of their head that &#34;page down&#34; means &#34;forward&#34;, the up-down system might be a bit confusing the first few times. I liked it, however, as it made sure my thumb was in easy range of the laser pointer whenever I needed it. (This could be seen as a con, though, if one is prone to accidentally hitting the wrong button and advancing the slide when one wants to use the laser pointer or vice-versa). I will say, however, that as the Dinofire has separate functions for press vs. press-and-hold for each button, it only advances your slides when you release the buttons, something that took some adjusting to. However, I do enjoy the variety of functions available on the up-down buttons (holding up starts your presentation, and holding down will black it out).<br />-Rechargeable. I knew about this one but wasn't quite prepared for how much it would mean to me. No longer being required to keep a stash of batteries in my desk is an amazing feeling. Plus it seems like it charges fairly quickly (left it to charge, came back 20 minutes later and it was done). The only downside here is that the USB port on the side seems to be a bit tight, so I always feel like I'm going to break it when I plug it in. However, I'm sure this will get better with time.<br />-USB dongle is held in magnetically. This is something I wasn't aware of at first. Essentially, it's just a fun little extra that means I don't have to worry about the springs or latches that hold the dongle inside the presenter wearing out at some point, or it falling out by accident. My Kensington lacks a discrete power button and is instead turned on when the dongle is ejected (using a spring-loaded latch mechanism) from the presenter. More than once I've found it with the dongle hanging out, having gotten triggered to eject somehow and therefore sitting there and wasting battery life. Therefore, though the dongle doesn't control the battery in the DinoFire, I'm fairly excited by this small but appreciated feature.<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Power switch is pretty close to where your fingers naturally sit while holding the presenter. I can mostly foresee this becoming a problem if the power switch becomes looser. No problems so far, but only time will tell. Also, I prefer the Kensington's method of power switching with the ejection of the dongle, since that way there's less risk (at least, in my mind) of the switch accidentally being flipped.<br /><br />COULD TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT:<br />-The Enter and Tab buttons on the side. I rarely need this functionality, especially the Tab. The Enter button, when held down, will Alt+F4 your presentation, closing it and going back to the powerpoint window. While this is maybe useful to some people, I don't see myself ever using it. The Tab button, meanwhile, does just that: Tab or, when held down, Alt+Tab.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is a nice little product. Only time will tell how it truly stands up, of course, but I have high hopes. So far, it's surpassed my previous product in almost every way.<br /><br />UPDATE 2018.04.27: Still going strong. Incredibly happy I bought this product and very satisfied with it. I've moved on to teaching at colleges, and I use this presenter for all my lectures. Some of my coworkers find the up/down + pointer layout confusing (they prefer left/right for previous/next slide) but I've adapted. Definitely would recommend this product, solid 5/5.<br /><br />UPDATE 2018.11.15: Sadly, after three years of use, I needed to buy a new unit. Nothing in the unit wore out per se (can confirm that the power switch was nowhere near being loose), but because I dropped it during a presentation. Doing so caused the magnet that holds the dongle in the unit (which was apparently only secured with a small dab of glue) to fall out of the space the dongle normally sits in. After that, with nothing holding it place when not in use, it was only a few days before I'd lost the dongle. So, moral of the story: don't be a klutz like me and drop your presenter.<br /><br />Re: the new unit, I will say that it feels much the same as the one I purchased 3 years ago. The buttons feel a little bit ""snappier"" and the plastic has a slightly different texture, almost heavier, but most of those are barely noticeable. The one thing I definitely did notice was quite different is the laser pointer. On the first unit I purchased, the laser pointer had great coherence with minimal scattering. While the new laser isn't bad, it does have more scattering over distance. At short ranges (like if you're standing in front of a small class with a projector screen behind you), the difference is fairly subtle. However, I'd imagine if this was used in a large presentation space (like at a conference) it would be very noticeable. I'm not sure if the laser manufacturer changed or if I just got a unit that was a little closer to failing QC checks but still passed or what. Regardless, the new unit is overall fantastic - I use it literally every day I'm at work - it's just not quite the same as my old one.",Office_Products

This black cartridge not only clogged, but damaged my printer. It was not a perfect fit, although it claimed to be compatible with my Epson 310 small wireless printer. I know you are asking why I inserted an ink that did not fit? Well it was not like it was a major profound noticeable occurrence. It was just a tiny fraction off and I assumed it was supposed to be that way. Not so. An authorized Epson repair center verified it was not compatible, and that the damage to my printer was either unrepairable, or would cost more tban a replacement. So if you want to continue to enjoy any namebrand printer then please may I suggest buying the manufacturer recommended ink for it.",Office_Products

Next year, I may add a head or two.<br /><br />Everyone in the neighborhood and all of my guests loved the effect. The hands are pretty realistic looking, much better than I had thought they would be, with good, skin like texture, and whitish flesh tones. They do have seams on the sides, but that is really not a problem, as you just face them towards your driveway in such a manner that the seams don't show (they don't really stand out to begin with as long as you are not right on top of them). You would have to wander around inspecting them quite closely to really find any issue with the seams, and no one has had anything but praise for them. The hands are hollow, made of a slightly pliant, but fairly rigid plastic, so don't plan on packing them away under anything heavy. If you are buying them online, that feature will save on shipping, but means that they will die under my Southern California sun a bit faster than if they had been solid.

The squirrels still ate all the food. Increased it to 5 times the amount and the squirrels still ate the food.

Very highly recommended.,Patio_Lawn_and_Garden
4,B0BZTZ3VW8,2020-08-04 18:53:06.983,"High quality.  Works easily and absorbs light easily. I was offered the chance to try and review this product, which really its a high quality solar panel presenting near 60 watts of charging power.  I was actually looking to purchase a solar panel to charge items because it is very cool technology and two because being prepared for emergencies is a good thing.<br /><br />What's in the box?:  You receive this large solar panel.  Make no mistake, this is not a cheap product or one for carrying around as you hike either (and it can't be because 60 watts at full charge requires a sufficient amount off surface area.  You also received some adapters for use which are not useful for me presently, but are nice to have which are two  Anderson connectors (to a MC4 connectors and to a DC 8mm connector).<br /><br />The panel has a small pocket (not really large enough for the Anderson connectors to be stored inside, but you could put both a USB C and a USB B cable inside depending on your needs.  The panel has two velcro legs which can be used to prop up the panel at an angle (not obvious from the instructions).<br /><br />Use?:  So I initially opened this up inside my house facing a window and could see a red light on the small adapter box so this means the panel is providing a charge.  Unfortunately, I don't own a voltmeter so can't provide a accurate measure, but given the sky was partially cloudy, I am sure this affected performance.  That is to say you can't get a read on power provided by simply seeing how bright the red light appears (in sunlight subtle differences aren't going to register.  Writing this I wish there was a measure of light strength somehow provided ideally but it isn't.<br /><br />This has two adapters available, which include a USB C and a regular USB (B ) port.  I tried initially suing this to power an IPAD which was at 0 % charge and after 1.5 hours in a less than ideal arrangement (standing vertical facing a partially cloudy sun that was at a 30 degree angle going away this still achieved a 23% charge within 1.5 hours.  In other words, the 60W capacity really does work.<br /><br />Overall?:  I intend to update this review as I use this panel further.  But as it stands now, this is a wonderful well made solar panel that really works and really provides power.  60 W is enough to charge most consumer electronics, and I suppose charging a phone with one USB and then charging a power bank would be the best way to go.  I now have confidence in a power shortage or on a outdoor camping trip I can easily power items that take a USB connector.  A really good product it appears from initial use.  I think the instructions could be far better and a bit more detailed as the instructions assume a certain level of knowledge of how to use the product.  Second, I have never seen a Anderson connector like the two presented here and needed to do research.  Perhaps the instructions could show putting that into a power bank or a similar application so the user would know.  Also, the velcro stands were not obvious and I don't believe the instructions really showed this either.<br /><br />Overall this is really good product, and the price point isn't cheap, but solar panels of quality are not cheap and this does provide the power it states.",Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

I mixed up 20 lbs of seed with this product, and went heavy on the sauce.  At first, the ground squirrels would eat some, drink a lot of water, then kind of back off.  Now they eat it anyway, and relentlessly drive off ground feeders like quail and dove that are trying to also feed.  It's possible the sauce does make them ""angry"", and they have become more aggressive as a result.  Guess I'll have to go back to trapping to get the local population under control.

It came just in time for the last hurricane, and my first test usage was the day after. Put it out in the sunshine with a device plugged in, and it did its thing and quickly. I've subsequently used it on a number of occasions to charge up headsets, my kindle, my phone, with no problems except that the plug to attach the unit to the item being charge is seated under the device, and it can be hard to tell if it's become unseated. One time, I tried to charge an item at 10% charge only to evidently dislodge the plug just enough to render it incapable of charging. Came back to find the item at 0% power.<br /><br />I love that this folds into a suitcase design, though, with a large surface area to catch that amazing solar power. It's light and easy to store and functioning fine.<br /><br />Oh! It also worked for me indoors. I have a sunroom with big windows and checked to see if it could get enough light through them to charge, and it does - not as quickly or efficiently as outside, but could be helpful in snowy conditions (which isn't too common where I live).<br /><br />One thing I don't much like is that the device bills itself as ""water-resistant to endure all weather conditions"" - but the juncture box is NOT water protected. Hence, I'm a bit anxious about unpredictable weather patterns in my area.<br /><br />I'm confused that they asked me to rate the warmth. Does it get hot to touch? Yes.

5,B0015Z5OLE,2015-10-13 17:25:15.000,"Simply the Best String Trimmer Line I've Ever Used. I find it comical that I'm actually leaving a review for string trimmer line, but that alone tells you how strongly I feel about it.  In this case, I feel very strongly positive about Tanaka line and it is likely the only line I ever use again.  I've been using string trimmers for years in a variety of environments, but the one constant was always the pain of replacing line.  I've used bargain basement stuff that possessed the durability of a wet tissue and I've used the so-called &#34;commercial grade&#34; stuff from the original tool manufacturers.  What I found was that just about all of it frayed, tangled, or just flat out snapped when coming into contact with anything outside of grass.  After relocating our family last year, I found myself with a newly-purchased string trimmer full of standard, run-of-the-mill line.  Shortly after the first two uses and about 472 curse words, I knew I needed something better.  I found this gem on Amazon for a great price and pulled the trigger --- so glad I did.<br /><br />I've now used this twice around my entire house's landscaping beds, around the inside of 100+ foot of linear fence, and around 200+ linear foot of sidewalks, curbs & driveway.  I was thrilled to see I had not even used half the string inside the trimmer head.  This stuff is the flat-out the best I've ever used and Tanaka has a customer for life.  The braided string holds up extremely well when in contact with concrete, stones, wood fencing and anything else a residential yard can throw at it.  I experienced zero tangles and it sliced through grass, dirt and some seriously large weeds like a hot knife through butter.<br /><br />If you're tired of messing with brittle, broken, & tangled lines, order yourself some Tanaka line and spend those 15-20 minutes you save each time by relaxing with a beer.",Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

Under a sunny day you could charge an iPhone in under an hour and an iPad in under two hours.<br /><br />Cons:<br />~ this is really nit picky but having the case around the solar panels black it's incredibly hot to touch when you store it away.<br /><br />As you can see it was impossible to find issues with the charger and overall I think at the price of 150 this is an amazing product.<br /><br />Review is for TogoPower 60W Portable Foldable Solar Panel Battery Charger with Dual USB Ports",Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

5,B0BZTZ3VW8,2020-07-30 01:46:59.425,"Nice panel, great form factor. This is my first solar charger and so far I'm impressed.  The folded form factor is great and easy to store and take with you on a camping trip.  When unfolded the panels are sturdy and easy to position.  The back of the two outer panels have velcro ""legs"" which prop the panel up at the desired angle to catch the sunlight.  The charge controller is housed on the back of the panel allowing you to plug in and store your charging device in the shade cast by the panel itself which is great.  I charged my Galaxy S10plus from 90% - 100% in about 25 minutes while my Oneplus 7T took about 35 minutes to charge from the same 90%-100%.  Some of this discrepancy was due to the sun setting and receiving more shade which prompted me to have to move the panel a few times to be in direct sunlight.<br /><br />Overall I think this is a great sturdy panel to have for emergencies and camping.  Being able to charge a battery bank or mobile device is awesome and the panel stores up nicely in a very thin form factor.  While this is a lot of money, it does appear to be on the cheaper end of fold-able solar panels and would likely be great for most of us when pressed for camping duties.",Patio_Lawn_and_Garden

This is a basic enclosed spa step (no under-step storage). We needed underside storage so we 1) added two hinges to the underside or the top step (there are pre-molded recesses for a 2&#34;x1 3/8&#34; hinge set, just like the Confer product minus the carry bin), and 2) modified the locking tabs (simple) on the top step underside, so the top step would not lock permanently in the down position as a fixed step would correctly do. The instructions specified a rubber mallet to assemble the step locking tabs but we just used a solid rap/hit from a bent palm which worked fine. Be sure to use the included screws to permanently lock the step together. We added two additional screws so all joints were not only locked in place but also screwed in place at the mold dimpled points.<br /><br />We needed the black espresso color combo that was not available via Amazon, so we sourced it from another vendor but SAME product here except for the espresso (dark brown) step color. [[ASIN:B001BT6EYA Leisure Accents Deluxe Spa Step, 36 Inches Long, Gray/ Black]]<br /><br />We used a plastic welder (soldering iron-like tool, but a regular soldering iron copper tip propane or electric, or a sharp utility knife would work) to knock off the sharp inside edges of the four locking tabs on underside of top step. Leave the four vertical lugs on the step body un-modified as they will slide into the step bottom when it's down.<br /><br />The Confer Plastics product costs 50%/100% more but you can buy a set of $2 hinges and modify this step and save yourself ~$50/$100 (minus the unnecessary storage box).

There were no directions and you know how us men do not read directions.  We would rather put it together twice.  With that said, it is easy to assemble.  The bowl holder goes on the bottom and the clip goes on top to hold the bowl in.  After putting them on, use the provided screws to attach the bottom.  Then screw in the feet. You may have to knock out a metal piece where to foot goes into with a screw driver or an icepick.  I had to on two of the feet.<br /><br />I like this because I bought an 8 week old  Bernese Mountain Dog puppy that is growing fast.  As she grows I can raise the bowls for her.  When I first brought her home, the bowls were on the ground.  One week later they are four inches off the ground.  I like the fact that the bowls can go up with her growth.<br /><br />The things I do not like is the fact that the unit is too light and my puppy can move it around even though I have it on a mat.  Also, if you are not good at putting things together you may need directions.  Last, you have to tighten the bowl knobs tight or there is a chance of the bowl slipping down if your dog is over zealous eating and pushes down on the bowl.  I over tightened the knob and the screw popped out.  The good thing is it still works.<br /><br />I would purchase this again at this time.

Worked great at first I loved the convenience of the bag holder (wish they would replace the flash light with a hand sanitizer dispenser).

Nice idea needs thicker leashes and better wheel.,Pet_Supplies

The air tubing that came with it was very soft and was kinked due to the way it was put into the box so I had to use my own air tubing. So far its doing what its suppose to do.

The only changes that would make the toy much better: the option to turn off the bird-like sound (which my cat doesn’t seem to care about) and an option to have the toy turn on automatically (either randomly or motion-activated). My cat seems to occasionally lose interest, and I think that’s because the circle pattern is somewhat predictable, so another nice improvement would be to have the laser move out of the circle pattern randomly as well, but overall this is a good toy for the price especially compared to other offerings on here.",Pet_Supplies

The quality of this product is better than I expected and I love all the little pouches and additional straps they give you. It's definitely a versatile pouch that was made with good craftsmanship and materials. I also really like the color scheme on this pouch. The orange makes treats and crumbs stand out when cleaning it. My only negative, was that the inner pouch needs to be aired out after you get it as it has a slight unpleasant odor due to nylon fabric (like the smell from a new backpack or similar nylon products), but that's really an issue as that's the type of odor you get from products made from that material.",Pet_Supplies

4,B07HK9D1Y4,2019-06-06 12:10:37.872,"Going strong after two weeks of constant use! I have a standard poodle puppy and and my wife and I needed treat bags we could wear constantly around the house when he's awake. And I mean 100% of the time. That's because it's vitally important to reward the behavior you want out of your puppy when it happens, not two minutes later after you make your way over to the pantry to grab a treat. So even though I've only had them a couple of weeks they've been used a lot.<br /><br />Construction is good. High denier polyester, good stitching, and the hooks, loops, and closures work well. The layout is good, too, though it's hard to mess up a hip bag. I do like the pocket and dispenser for poop bags, and it's nice to have an exterior mesh pocket for holding used bags, keys, etc. The top of the bag doesn't have a zipper (just a cinch closure), but that's not an issue even though we use small kibble (his food) for training treats. I have a massive phone so it sticks out of the zipper pocket, but it's nice to have a place other than in my pocket to put my phone. The plastic loop or the mesh pocket can be used to attach/hold pepper spray. The bags wash well. I'd recommend using a lingerie bag so the cinch loop doesn't catch on anything else while in the wash.<br /><br />I only have a couple of downsides to the bag, and they're very minor. First, if you want to just use the belt clip (which is very sturdy by the way), removing the belt is a bit tricky. Not impossible, but it does take a bit of work to get it through the retaining loops and over the belt clip. So keep that in mind if switching between the two types is something you'll want to do frequently. And when using the belt clip only, the top of the bag is open more than when using the belt, as the belt pulls it a little closer to you. It's not caused a problem, but if you are in close quarters the bag might catch on things as you walk by. Also, after two weeks of constant use, the web belt has started to narrow a bit where it hits the hips due to the weight of the bag and being compressed while sitting. It's not a problem really, but if you're  on the heavy side it may dig in after a while. If you can lay your hands on a cotton web cinch belt or military type belt, it holds up much better. Finally, I have a 38 in waist and the adjustment for the belt is probably only good for someone with a 40 inch waist. So again, if you're on the large size, you may want to ensure the belt fits, or buy one that does. Again, these are small quibbles and the bag works really great for hard use.<br /><br />Overall these are great bags that will last a long time. Nice construction, good ergonomics and plenty of room for goodies.",Pet_Supplies

5,B01MY00RYY,2016-10-20 16:40:44.000,"Major learning curve, but a complete set of video editing tools in a single package. Remember when your mother would warn you not to take too big a bite of dinner? Because it was more than you could chew? Pinnacle Studio 20 reminds me of that -- enormously powerful, absolutely everything you could ask for and then some -- and a significant learning curve if you want to master this software. Mercifully there's a free 21-day introductory series of videos which patiently explain all of the features and conventions in excruciating detail.<br /><br />Installation was lengthy but I had zero problems (on a standard Windows 10 PC). I'd fooled around with Adobe Premiere in the past and this has a similar setup, with a timeline window, preview window, et cetera. I did find myself wishing I had a second monitor, you'll want all the screen real estate you can muster.<br /><br />Then it's a matter of time: this software contains just about everything up to and including the kitchen sink as far as video editing goes. Endless effects and fancy tricks. I'm more used to an Apple-style window setup, but I had no problems figuring out what was what. But it's a matter of how much time you want to devote to it. The tools are there, and rather robust, but there is a significant learning curve, even with the video tutorials. Very impressed overall.",Software

I am not a preparedness guru by any means, but I do like to keep things in my truck that I may need.  My fiancé says I have everything but the kitchen sink in there somewhere, but he's grateful when I can whip out bug spray, a blanket, a dog leash, a flashlight or a first aid kit when something happens.  This set have a basic first aid for like cuts and scraps, a flashlight, a knife, a poncho, a pair of gloves, some paracord, and quite a few other items.  Personally, I love the pick bag and it's a good size. I used this pack as a base.  I have added a few things to it and moved a few things I was less likely to use into a different storage area in my truck.

Its small and compact and doesn't take much room in your bag or pack and because it is not rigid, you can stuff it in any tight spot with no troubles.

But he's had some muscle pulls so we wanted something different.  We thought about an elliptical but they are a lot more $$.  We looked at a bunch of rowers and liked this one for several reasons.  1. It had good reviews.  2. It combines the fan resistance with the magnetic resistance.  3.  It was moderately priced.  4.  It is pretty quiet.  5. It has wheels so I can move it around.  All that being said, the box came from the UPS truck completely banged up.  My husband helped carry it in but I put it together.  It didn't take long.  6 steps to assemble it.  The directions are pretty basic but each step has a set of parts nicely labeled.  We did get a mat to put under it and that was a good idea because without the mat it will slide on the wood floor.  If it was on a rug it would probably not need a mat.  The muscle workout from this machine is pretty intense.  I have only been able to use it at a 2 out of 8 and that is only for a little while.  I go between a 1 which is only fan resistance to a 2.  I feel the burn in my rear end, legs and back.  I agree that this won't build muscle but it will tone up the legs, core and back nicely.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it is bulky to move around.

Then the seat begins scraping on the bar. I disassemble and realize that the screws were loose on the seat. This was not part of the assembly instructions. Fearing something might occur with the seat in the future. I re-open the box and pull out the new seat and repackage once again. Yikes! What I finally discerned was that this must of been a return and it was not QA'ed. It caused me quite a bit of time and frustration, but the end result is good.

It has time, row count, a poor calorie counter, and a total row count. You can reset all but the total. A distance would be more helpful than an inaccurate calorie. Second is the slop between reset and next pull. Theres about 4-6 inches of no resistance while the spool resets. That's a big distance of lost training on the leg push.

Quality control is poor for packaging and assembly as my computer came damaged and had to be replaced.  The vent was pushed into the body which I was able to pull out by loosening  shroud screws around the vent.  The center wheel under the shroud that feeds the belt holding the handle was way off center.  It took me nearly an hour to open the shroud and readjust the center wheel.  With all those fixes the rower works fine but the &#34;computer&#34; is another story. I bought my rower two months ago and have been using it four days a week.  The rowing part seems fine but I don't have anything to compare it to.<br />The &#34;computer&#34; is worthless.  It doesn't keep time accurately when compared to my phone timer and another timer I have.  The counter is off and inconsistent.  The calorie counter is a joke and doesn't match any of the typical charts for calories burned for rowing exercise at any level.  I just use my own timer for my 30 minute work outs.

These kits are never replacements for getting individual components yourself, and I wouldn't rely on any of them for actual survival, but they can be fun for certain things. In my case, I got it for my daughter, and after I removed all of the dangerous implements, I gave it to her and she immediately wanted to dress up her arm with the bandage, gauze, and tape. I've taken her backyard camping several times, so this helped her feel like she was really roughing it. Shortly after this, she cut her knee open and we got to use the first aid kit for real! So it's at least somewhat useful. I will always have my real gear with me when we go hiking, so we'll be prepared, but this kit will help her feel like she's participating.<br /><br />For the curious, here are the major things wrong with it:<br />The knife is an insult to knives everywhere. It's even smaller than I thought it would be, and it's not going to stand up to anything. Having it is worse than not having a knife, because you'll believe you're prepared, but when it breaks, you could be seriously injured, or at least left knifeless. The fishing tackle is an act of desperation, and desperation is what you'll feel if you try to use it as-is. It's best if you just use the components as part of a better tackle. The ""survival"" bracelet is only that: a bracelet made of cord. I can't even be sure it's real paracord, but if it is, it's almost certainly extremely low load. A really experienced survival expert could probably make it work for something, but then a really experienced survival expert wouldn't come within a hundred yards of this kit. I have no idea what the extending pole is supposed to do except bend eventually. Is it a straw? The saw is a joke. Even if I used it properly by extending it between the ends of a bent stick, it feels like it would break pretty quickly.<br /><br />Here are the good things:<br />The flashlight is bright! I wouldn't trust it in the rain, but it's bright! The poncho works as a poncho, though it's constructed like a single-use poncho. The gloves seem to be fine. I don't know how useful they'll be outside of gardening, but they seem fine. The whistle is nice and loud, and the compass on it actually points north! I have no idea how accurate the thermometer is, but it seems pretty accurate. The first aid kit is full of good, standard stuff, but I'd suggest replacing a lot of it with better versions if you plan to use it in the wild. The scissors actually cut gauze, but just barely.<br /><br />I'm not going to go into too much more detail here. You get the idea. Don't trust your life to this, or to any kit like it. Get your own supplies. Use this kit for mild recreation, or for practice, or as a toy, or if you hate yourself. I give it 4 stars because it made my daughter really happy, and it'll be a good stepping stone to real equipment.",Sports_and_Outdoors

Luckily she was ok and only has bruises externally, and her head seems fine. We just watched her, she is 17 years old. She was able to communicate well with us how she felt, thankfully just very sore and bruised.

4,B01M1490P2,2019-04-15 15:24:20.338,"Review from a non-rower. The Mrs. and I were looking for a machine to get some strength and cardio in.  We didn't want a treadmill, and neither of us were interested in a bike.  There were several recommendations for exercising with a rowing machine.  Not knowing or having used a rowing machine before, we were concerned about spending a lot of money on something that we would  burn out on real quick.  So we bought this machine as a ""trial"" run, and if it broke, or we decided we didn't like to row, then we would not have burned a huge sum.<br /><br />The machine was easy to assemble, and works well for us; again neither of us are professional rowers, so would have no idea whether we're getting full extension or whether it's anything like actually rowing in competition crew.<br /><br />It has developed a creak when in use (but it might be the fact that I'm 230 lbs) and the digital readout is placed so that you can't see it easily while in use.  It's also a little frustrating that the tension is still a little weak at even the highest setting.  We were hoping that at the highest setting, the wheel would be more difficult to spin, but we really can't tell the difference between a setting of 5 and 8 (the highest tension setting).  We've had it about 6 months now, have used it nearly every day, and so far, so good.<br /><br />I'll update if we start having issues with it.",Sports_and_Outdoors

First impressions: the CycPlus gives you the basic riding info: current speed, max speed, average speed: elapsed time, distance, odometer (total distance) and and total time. Clock time (24 hour clock) and altitude are also shown. There are only two settings, C-4 for switching between miles and kilometers, and C-6, to set your time zone based on GMT. (For example, Arizona is GMT -7). There is no app to communicate with or store records and no settings for use on multiple bikes. No senders are required; fasten the GPS to your handlebars, turn it on, wait for it to connect to satellites, and ride. It takes about 20 seconds after the unit is turned on to connect with GPS satellites and does not work if the sky view is interrupted for any length of time. When you turn off the GPS the speed, elapsed time and trip distance settings are erased. The readout is large enough to for most of us to see without glasses and backlighting is automatic. The Cycplus comes with a basic mount that uses rubber bands of several sizes to fit different handlebar diameters but it will fit standard Garmin mounts available from a variety of vendors on Amazon. The Cycplus does what it is designed to do well. I plan to purchase additional mounts so I can us it easily on multiple bikes.",Sports_and_Outdoors

I was using it for a flashlight until it gets a bit warmer to use on my bike and tried to run it down and it ran for the better part of the day.  A few days after getting it it wouldn't turn on and on the back there are 4 screws.  I thought I'd check the battery pack and get some new cells, I liked it so much I was willing to fix it.  The problem is the cells are soldered together, which in itself isn't a problem, I was willing to get my soldering iron out, but they connect to the logic board with a connector way in front of the falshlight.  I pulled the batteries out, they came with no resistance, so I think they became disconnected by themselves.  The wire is too short to get tweezers to re-connect them, it was built from the other side and the front has the lights glued in so there is no way for me to connect the batteries again to test it.  I'm not sure why it was built this way, if it is this easy to open why not make it serviceable?  All it would need was a longer wire to connect.

4,B01M1490P2,2016-10-18 18:42:22.000,"Pretty good rowing machines. I'm new to the world of rowing so some of the things I say may seem out of place to experienced rowers. Having said that, I do enjoy this rowing machine. It is a really good workout and hits your whole body. The noise level isn't terribly loud but it does make some noise from the fan and the sliding. Setting it up was super simple. It took me about 40 minutes to get it all set up and running. The display probably won't have what you're wanting if you are an experienced rower but for me it doesn't matter. I've been just going for a set amount of time using my Fitbit to time it in workout mode. One reviewer complained about the strap connected to the rowing handle being a bit tattered on one side. I guess he just had some bad luck as mine arrived just fine. One thing I don't like particularly is how it seems to be more resistance at the end of the pull and barely any at the start. I'm not sure if that is normal for a rowing machine or not..? But the push off with my legs is super easy and barely any fan noise then at the end with the arm pull to my chest you hear the BIG whooooooosh of the fan. Being a newbie on rowing machines I could just be off a little on form, but watching videos and stuff I think I got a pretty solid handle on that. Overall a great addition for my home gym and I recommend it!",Sports_and_Outdoors

It keeps track in miles or kilometers and does so well. I wanted something that tracks my miles and my speed. This does that plus it tracks my time (only while cycling), my long term miles cycled, and my average and top speeds. There are a few other things it tracks as well but these are the things I pay attention to.<br /><br />The battery life is fine. It's nothing exceptional in my opinion but it isn't terrible either. It comes dead so you'll need to charge it to get started. It seems to last around 2 weeks before it begins indicating that it needs charging again.<br /><br />The drawbacks:<br /><br />Well it comes preset to kilometers and it is fairly difficult to switch over to miles. The instruction manual really didn't help much in this endeavor. Once I got it switched it was good to go though.<br /><br />Sometimes it doesn't kick in and begin counting right away. If I turn it on and wait a little while before I head out then it seems to kick right on though. So basically turn it on, then pull out your bike and get yourself all set and ready to head out. It doesn't take long, just give it a minute or two after you turn it on.",Sports_and_Outdoors

Easy to read display with useful information. One reviewer noted that the mounting bands had to be removed - this is not correct. The unit does easily twist off to recharge.<br /> I knocked off a star because of an obvious and strange design flaw, and also, a lack of proper set up instructions.<br />1)  The FOUR unit displays miles or kilometers. When you select miles, the unit displays ""feet"" until it reaches 9,999 feet, at which point it converts to mile.  So 9,999 ft./5,280 = 1.9 miles (rounded).  It does this every time you power the unit on!  VERY, VERY odd, I have no idea why someone would design it this way, but it makes no sense at all. I go on 10 mile plus bikes rides, so it's fine, but wanted to point out this oddity. Lastly on this point - I contacted the seller on this issue, while they politely accepted my pointing this out - they seemed not to have any idea that issue existed.<br />2) The set up includes a time zone setting designated by digits 0 to 9. There is nothing in the instructions to indicate what those values refer to. The seller provided me with the world time zone map and apparently the values correspond to  the time zones. That's fine - but please include that in the instructions!<br />Anyway, still a great unit and I would recommend it.",Sports_and_Outdoors

So far so good, unit is smooth, feels sturdy enough, display unit is tough to see though.  As mentioned, the ergonomics are a bit off (for me) but for the price I have no complaints.  If this works out and I enjoy rowing machines, I may sell this unit in a year or so and buy a Concept 2.

5,B07MGJZ2MH,2020-01-16 19:34:26.240,"They must put crack into this. Ok, so I got the first box here half price with the rare Black Friday sale.  I figured I’d get one box then cancel before the full price subscription starts (make sure you do this as soon as it ships if you plan that).  Well, I did that, then got the box... finished it in 3 days and haven’t stopped thinking about it since!  Like any uncustomizable service, you might find some percentage of the set not to your tastes.  However, if you are a true connoisseur of Japanese snacks,  I think you will be impressed by the quality and variety of the offerings.  No, this is not cheap, although I did think it was definitely worth it for the sale price... full price, it is rather extravagant.  On the other hand, I don’t think you would find some of these unusual snacks anywhere else… Not at most nearby asian grocery stores (I live near 5, including large supermarket types with many Japanese snacks).  A few of these can certainly be classed “artisan” and not that mass-produced.  For example, the white chocolate infused strawberry.  I still cannot figure out how they made that.  It’s like the strawberry was actually injected with chocolate as it was freeze-dried, perfectly melded together.  That big spicy cracker thing and the pear cream biscuit were amazing, too.  Many of the other savory snacks also had a lot of complexity and depth to their flavors.  They deftly combine subtle sweet, sour, spicy, salty, and umami notes together.  They put American snacks to shame because these seem to be very one-note in comparison—just sickly sweet or too salty.  I think it’s cool how Bokksu includes a booklet so you can learn more about the snacks and Japanese culture, too (every box has a theme).  To be sure, these are ‘high end’ fancy snacks not for bargain shoppers or those with unadventurous and unelevated palates.  Look, I have easy access to Asian supermarkets within 5 minutes from me and I’m Chinese American—I’m well familiar with shrimp crackers, dried seaweed rice crackers, Pocky, mochi, etc; in contrast, these boxes are not run-of-the mill and is not for everyone.  You have to be willing to try different flavors and clearly, some of the reviewers who didn’t like it weren’t.  Anyway, after I finished the box, I couldn’t stop thinking about it.  After trying to ignore the cravings for a week, I ended up going on the website and purchasing a 6 month subscription for $230.  I never would have thought I’d pay that much for monthly snack boxes before,  but it is officially an addiction now! I’m sure it’s a luxury that I’m not going to be able to afford eventually… however,  I’m going to just try it out for a few months.  I don’t know if I can say $40 a box is “worthwhile” to most people, but for me, I must feed the obsession!",Subscription_Boxes

2,B09TMNNYWH,2020-10-01 15:35:06.284,"Size Runs VERY Small and Short. I'm 5'11 and am usually a 2XL. Since this was going to be my first order, I went up one size to 3XL. It fit like a brand name XL in terms of width. It was very short, barely reaching my waist. This shirt might fit someone 5'6"" and on the heavy side.  No way it wil fit anyone over 5'8"".  It's just not going to cover their front or rear, especially if bending, stretching or leaning.  I measured the chest  across and it was 2"" shorter than the size chart said it was.  Which means, it's 4"" too narrow for it's size.  As a 2XL I could probably have worn it but with any shrinkage in wash cycle, it would be too small and too short.<br /><br />The other issue is that this is one of the thinnest and lightest weight tee shirts I have ever purchased.  I would expect that after 20-30 wash and wear cycles it would become thin and essentially unusable.<br /><br />The design is OK but not as good as it is pictured here.  Colors are not as pure or as deep.  Saturation is inconsistent.  Clarity is OK but with much wear it will drop off.<br /><br />In short, this is a disappointing product. For the price, if you are willing to have a cheaply made shirt, it's an OK value. For something with the Star Trek brand, I would expect higher quality.",Subscription_Boxes

I was one of the original subscribers but stopped a while back because the boxes were getting barren and the prices were going down on the pops that came in them.<br />I thought that things would change now that Amazon is offering them.<br />Man was that not the case... I received it with 3 things in the box, no pin or patch, the shirt was very cheap looking and the pop was dented.  I would normally say shipping dented it but it was on the inside where it wasnt near the outside of the box and there was no scuffs on the new high polish box.  The actual box arrived better than the pop did.  So I'm going to be cancelling my sub AGAIN.  Btw the pops arent exclusive anymore.

5,B07TTNQJMW,2021-08-04 13:18:47.828,"Perfect for the Right Couple. Read the reviews and you'll know right away if this is for you. Do you take yourself seriously? Don't order. Do you like fancy restaurants and culture for your date nights? This isn't for you. Do you want each shipment to be an investment in products that you can use again and again? Um, that's not what a date night is, so no.<br /><br />My husband and I have been married 19 years. We're both introverts but we enjoy laughing together. I'm a top-of-the-ladder professional and my husband  is a ""guys guy"" type who wears steel toed boots to work. We firmly believe the science that doing something novel together builds our relationship and we're willing to try new things. But unless you have a lot of time and money and a reliable babysitter, it's hard to find novel activities. The point of the date night is each other.<br /><br />The latest date was Hippie themed. We learned to tie dye bandanas, played a card game that had us answering questions to understand each other better, did face paint on each other that symbolized questions we wanted the other person to answer (and took photos and washed it off because we do have jobs to get to in the morning), etc.<br /><br />One box lasts us multiple nights because we're tired and we only have the stamina for one activity per night. Also we use the activities as jumping off points to actually connect with each other, not just check the box that we did the activity. We have fun together. And that takes time.<br /><br />At first $40 felt like a lot but a lot of thought and planning goes into each box. Yes, you could buy an expensive board game for $40 and play it many times. But that's not really the point. The activities are all designed by a therapist to help us connect with each other. After 19 years and 2 kids, that's something we desperately needed. Some of the activities keep on giving,<br />the card game this month has replay value. One box is worth about 4 sessions of marriage counseling for us... and that's a steal at $40!

5,B07KM6T8GV,2019-06-21 19:53:35.903,"Best beauty subscription for redheads. How to Be a Redhead is a great beauty subscription box with a unique specialty— it’s for redheads. It’s available as a regular monthly subscription (for $25) or deluxe subscription (for $65 which arrives quarterly) both are well worth it and both are packed with goodies that are suitable for redheads!<br /><br />For years I wanted to buy one of those monthly beauty subscription boxes, but I never did because I knew from experience that any time I’d buy an all inclusive selection of makeup (skin products, or eyeshadow palettes etc…) inevitably I end up getting annoyed and frustrated that almost everything in it is suited to “average” skin tones, which (compared to most redheads) that ends up being about 3-to-4 shades too dark— and therefore half of the pre-selected items would be useless— and that’s if I’m lucky! It usually ended up being more like 80% useless products that are all wrong for a redhead’s skin.<br /><br />I understand the redhead population is relatively small (it’s estimated at only 1%–2% of the world’s population) but that said, it’s still a lot of people and as consumers, a redhead’s money is worth every bit as much as a blonde’s or a brunette’s, so it annoyed me how everything was catered to being either blonde or brunette and redheads (along with other groups) were all relegated to one “miscellaneous” category. Understanding this is one thing but I still wished I could easily find suitable products.<br /><br />After years of feeling left out, I stumbled upon #H2BARbox. It’s been a godsend.<br /><br />Each month your $25/ monthly subscription box is supposed to deliver a selection of redhead-friendly products to your door, said to be valued at many times more expensive than that $25/month subscription amount— and FTR, I do believe this to be true. I’m generally a skeptical person so I usually go online and check the individual prices myself just to make sure their claims hold up and to make sure I’m really getting my money’s worth.<br /><br />Now, to be clear— it’s not always makeup, and it’s not always skincare. On average, the breakdown is APPROXIMATELY 70%-30%, the majority of them being hair and skincare products. Another complaint I read was the products are not always JUST for redheads.<br /><br />NB: #H2BAR never claimed they curate products that are for “REDHEADS ONLY”, it’s just that some people apparently read into their description too much and then were disappointed the products were I guess “too versatile”? Since it’s estimated that Redheads only make up about 1%–2% of the earth’s population, it shouldn’t be surprising that makeup and beauty product manufacturers are not rushing to gear entire product lines towards such a small, niche market. Of course only SOME products will be for “redheads only”… but ALL will be “redhead friendly”, and that’s what was missing from other beauty box subscriptions.<br /><br />The only real complaint that I have is that the perceived value of boxes is sometimes inconsistent. That is to say, some months the amount you get *feels* like you are really getting a great value and you can easily see how the sum of the products would retail for well over $250… but other months it doesn’t seem that way and it feels like you’re getting less. They would do well to even it out.<br /><br />So to sum up, it sometimes feels lopsided. One month you might get a tube of sunblock, a fabulous full size Paul Mitchell shampoo and conditioner, a cute little makeup bag or brush, a nice moisturizer or a face serum, a pretty lipgloss in a redhead friendly shade, a mascara or eyebrow pencil (also in redhead friendly shades) and maybe a sample or two (usually of a higher-end, new &/or more expensive product, like toner or face serum) and on those months, you couldn’t be happier with your subscription. Those months you can easily see the value and you are thrilled with what you’re getting for $25…<br /><br />but then other months— you’re less than thrilled. Some shipments feel too heavy on the samples. Samples are great too,and they’re appreciated in a beauty subscription box— especially when it’s a luxury brand—but add too many samples and it starts to feel (and look) cheap. Plus, it gets annoying.<br /><br />I always put samples aside for “travel” but then they end up being forgotten (or passed over in favor of bringing something else I’ve already tried and I KNOW works for me and that I’m sure I like) samples often get lost or expire and then have to be discarded, after they’ve withered away at the bottom of my beauty stash.<br /><br />Another issue I have with the excessive sample sizes is that the writing on the packages is always minuscule (or non-existent) and you have to save the little postcard that comes along with each shipment (which details the items they included that month, describes what it does, and/or its ingredients) and it inevitably gets lost or thrown away. In my experience, you pretty much have to use them right away— but, depending on what the samples are (e.g. sunblock or deep conditioning masque) you don’t necessarily need or WANT to use them right away, but I always find if I don’t use the samples right away, they just fall by the wayside. If I can’t identify the contents of the sample and it’s been sitting in my drawer for months. If I’m not sure of the contents, I usually just end up throwing them out.<br /><br />Although I have checked H2BAR’s claims (I’ve googled each and every product) and I found that YES, technically the products WOULD retail for at least $250 and each box DOES work out to be roughly the same value from month-to-month (dollar-wise… the items always retail for CONSIDERABLY more than the $25/ month subscription price) but  some months it doesn’t SEEM like you’re getting an equivalent amount compared to previous months. One month you’re delighted with your #H2BARbox haul… but then other times you feel little bit disappointed and the amount feels a little thin, by comparison.<br /><br />For example:<br />Claim: to (usually) send full-sized products<br /><br />Truth: Yes. Mostly this is the case— USUALLY, *but* occasionally (especially when they include something like a boutique brand, or higher-and serum, for example or some other prohibitively expensive item no one could possibly reasonably expect to receive a full-sized container of that item (along with several other products) inside their $25/monthly subscription box… they just give you a department store style sample. Sometimes there’s an online coupon code for10%-15% off that product (in addition, or sometimes INSTEAD of an actual sample) for said item. Those are annoying and truthfully (because you’d have to shell out additional money for that item to even get the discount) I don’t factor those into the overall value of the #H2BARbox or even appreciate getting those at all. It also doesn’t help that I usually don’t even know anything about the brand, or if I even like the product they’re giving me the coupon for, plus they ARE asking you to drive to a store (or order online and pay shipping) and you’d have to shell out more cash. These days, if you want me traipsing around a mall or shopping center, then you’re going to have to do better than that. Usually the discount they offering is ONLY about 10% or 15% off. That’s probably the manufacture’s doing, but still… #H2BAR IS including these coupons on occasion and they make it feel off-brand— very tacky.<br /><br />That’s all well and good, but looking at the contents on those “thin months”, I can safely say that if that paltry LOOKING box (even though the cash value is probably equal to or greater than the others) can be a detriment. Last month’s box was a little heavy on the samples for my taste, and honestly I would have preferred it if they’d combined the value of those trial sizes and just thrown in one full size product instead (not even necessarily that same item or brand) just a full sized SOMETHING, rather than tons of trial size it’s preferable to the alternative, which is getting the same number of fluid ounces as the full size, only in sample/ trial-size form. If that month had been my very first foray into #H2BARbox, then I might have been one of those people griping online about it, and my first shipment would have been my last. My only complaint is about the lack of consistency there was in *perceived value* of boxes from one month, to the next. First impressions are everything and some months H2BAR makes a better impression than it does on others.<br /><br />If I had received a sample-heavy box my first (or 2nd) month, I probably would have just canceled my subscription right then and there too. The majority of negative reviews I have read though are from people who are unhappy because of the of people who use hair color, well news flash: there are people who are natural redheads and who also use hair color, sometimes to touch up gray hair, sometimes just for fun.<br /><br />When you love a product, you’re happy. When you’re not-so-in-love with what they sent, you want to know you at least got your money’s worth. Most people are not going to have the patience to google the price of each item like I did. People just eyeball it. They size it up, and rely on *perceived value*. If customers are happy because they *think* they’re getting a good deal, then they usually ARE getting a good deal.<br /><br />Overall though, I still think the #H2BARbox is fantastic. It’s a great gift for a redhead (or for anyone with similar pale or rosy skin tone) there is nothing else like this— not that I’ve ever seen.<br /><br />As a company though I do think they would do well to make each monthly shipment more consistent in its *perceived value* (vs. its actual/cash value, “costs a lot” doesn’t always = “looks expensive”)… because judging by the (relatively few) negative Amazon reviews, that seemed to be the most repetitive theme.<br /><br />The other complaints were about the brands. There are no “cheap” brands. Some reviewer was upset because she’d never heard of a particular brand of skincare product, so she  decided they must have thrown it in there because it must be “cheap”— meanwhile it was a luxe boutique brand and she wasn’t familiar with it because the entire line was brand new, she’s obviously a bargain shopper and it’s not sold in drugstores.<br /><br />If you’re someone who’s brand loyal, who has a narrow scope of “faves” And you just want to use the same products over and over again, then H2BAR (and in all likelihood, also any other beauty subscription box) is probably just not for you.<br /><br />It’s like handing a friend $25 and saying “You know I’m a redhead and you know what kinds of beauty products I usually buy, Here’s $25— surprise me!”<br /><br />If that sounds like a fun idea or something interesting you’d be curious to try, then you’ll probably love #H2BARbox too.<br /><br />If you are someone who’s open to trying new beauty and skincare products, if you’re someone who loves little surprises and who enjoys discovering and trying new brands— AND you also happen to be a redhead, then you’ll probably love it too.",Subscription_Boxes

There were full sized John Frieda redhead shampoo and conditioner bottles, plus a hair mask, a different type of eyebrow product (this time was perfect for me -- in fact it looks more natural on me than my own brows which are oddly brown), some other samples, and a full sized Aurora sunblock. The JF items were probably valued $25, and I looked up the sunblock and it was $53.

That box seemed fun but I was worried most products may not suit my sensitive skin so I love that every time I know these products will be safe even if they aren't always a perfect color match.<br /><br />12-17-19 edit: some later months had smaller sizes or repetitions. I'm using these as stocking stuffers but may cancel for a while. Still a pretty good value though.",Subscription_Boxes

So we are working on his coordination with this toy... he love it but honestly it’s me setting them up and him knocking them down. But... I looked up the same toy we received on Amazon and it’s 35.00! We paid half that so I’d say the value is awesome. The first toy might be a little advanced for my little guy but that’s part of learning right? He will get the hang of it. That’s the point learning new skills. :) So in short, quality toy? Yes.

1,B01M71IUZ7,2019-03-17 13:34:42.941,"Pathetic toys. We gave this 3-4 year old stem club toy box a shot,(our son is 3) much longer than it deserved. About 6 months, which is 6 boxes. After the last one me and my son’s dad agreed that we are just wasting $20 every single month on pure garbage. Only two boxes we kept, the rest were put out on the street. Of the two we kept, they were the automobile kit where you get big clunky pieces that can be transformed into 6-7 vehicles. It’s cool, but has it’s problems. It’s just a frame of a vehicle you build and if my son wants to lay with the build it gets flattened and can come apart. The second we kept was a science experiment that came with very basic stuff and a booklet for cool things to do, which most of stuff asked for things we don’t have from the outside like sand, rocks, leaves, etc. we could only do a few of them. These were the only decent ones. There was a third one my son really liked, you put together plastic maze pieces and you can build your own complex maze or “track”. Unfortunately, my son kept getting hurt. It’s very painful to step on these pieces. It happened to me too. Anyway, the last box he received was the most pathetic out of all. It was foam squares that had a certain number of holes in them. 1-10. And you put plastic screws in each hole. That’s the toy. It was unbelievable and really pathetic. My son is already past these toys. He knows his numbers and letters and shapes and colors and more. I’m going to give stem box one more time, but for older age. 5-7 year old AND 8-13 year old. Just to see what kind of stuff they send in this age group. Already got our first box for each of those age groups and it looks very promising.",Subscription_Boxes

4,B07TTNQJMW,2020-10-12 22:08:04.352,"Overall a great experience, but some flaws. I got the Halloween box for 2020. Spoilers ahead if you have already received it!<br /><br />The idea is, you get all these cards with a hotel room number on one side and you lay them down. Then you get some riddles that are supposed to direct you towards a certain room number to advance - most rooms are just empty, but the riddle will direct you to the five you need. The problem is, the riddles suck! One of them, the picture of the room had a grandfather clock next to it. The riddle mentioned a father and described him as having ""A palatial paternal instinct"". Palatial means ""like a palace"". Grand could be considered a synonym, but it's really just not the same thing. So you were supposed to put palatial paternal together to mean grandfather.... but no one would do that, because it's really not what the word means. Another riddle had you pull out a cocktail napkin that was included in the box (after the warning to not look at anything in the box until you're specifically referred to it) but then the cocktail napkin ends up not even being part of the solution anyways. Part of that same riddle involved counting the windows with lights out that are on the box. However, the box is mis-printed! One of the sides is a duplicate that will crash your solution to the puzzle.<br /><br />All that being said, we had a blast. Every time you solve a riddle they give you a neat little game to play (Go find 3 pieces of clothing for your partner to wear, go make a hat using 4 ingredients from the kitchen and your partner has to wear it all night, etc.)",Subscription_Boxes

You can buy most if not all these candy at a local Asian market. If you live on the east coast or west coast, this would not be a problem. Let me warn you that the 20-25 piece of candy is extremely misleading. A tiny single wrap chocolate counts as one of those ""piece"" of candy. You are really getting 10-15 pieces of regular size Japanese candy and for Japanese candy, regular size is small, and small is one piece.

The presentation was great and I appreciated having an assortment to choose from but the majority of the snacks were not for me. The Lemon Vinegar Arare (2 included) tasted stale (not sure if that was the intention but I did not like it all). The setouchi mochi puffs (2 packs included) have a bad aftertaste but the overall taste is passable.  I got 2 packs of orange stick cakes which was okay tasting. I really liked the candied iyokan peels, they were like chewy, candied orange peels-I got one pack of those.  The yuzu peanut brittle (2 included) was a chewy caramel snack and I did not expect that. It was good, though. My favorite item was the mikan orange mochi.  Sadly, there were only two of those so I will have to search for a way to get more.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I got this box when I did. I had been eyeing this for a long time so when Amazon had a sale I decided to go for it. I went ahead and canceled my subscription to this box because maybe my taste buds do not align with the tastes of whoever picks out the snacks.

I'm overall satisfied with the subscription and am going to change it to the 5-7 age range.  below are short reviews on each kit we have received.<br />We got the gears kit and built some of the models.  They showed a robot on the bucket however it wasn't in the instruction booklet so we had a blast trying to figure it out as a family.  The platforms and gears are sometimes hard to take apart but other then that a good toy, plus it came in a nice hard plastic bucket for storage and additional play.<br />We received the Automobile Engineer kit and the 4 y/o and his friends love to build the different cars (the book has instructions for at least 4).  They either don't want to take it apart or they like to crash it to bits (but that's what boys do).  The kit had color coded pieces to indicate different lengths and sizes which is sometimes hard for the kids to differentiate and the instructions aren't written piece by piece.  Overall it provides just enough learning with limited adult assistance.<br />We received the Cod-a-pillar recently and my kids don't play with it.  We have limited hard flooring that the kids can play on so it doesn't have room to roam.  they both already have remote controlled toys and cars so this is slow and boring waiting for it to turn. Although the most expensive kit so far it's the least enjoyable for our family.<br />We received the drill and screw peg board thing and it's so much fun for both kids.  It comes with interchangeable bits for an electric and hand drill, different color screws and pattern maps.  the little one learns dexterity and the use of tools and the older one follows the patterns.  They actually play well together on this one and the older one teaches the little one the right pattern.  Love this kit! (the drill goes clock wise and counter clock wise to remove screws).<br />We also received the Math Playbox.  It's the most traditional kit since it teaches simple math.  the pieces are hard pressed cardboard vice wood (they look like wood on the pic).  It requires adult assistance to explain the math principles because it's built like a puzzle and my child just matches the pieces to the holes.  It reinforces his numbers and allows him to visualize the math problems.  It bores me as an adult but I don't get complaints when I suggest we play with it so I'll take it as a win.",Subscription_Boxes

My husband and I both have degrees in the sciences (Chemistry/Computer Science) so I was thrilled to find that Amazon had a Stem Club.  But what a disappointment.  The first toy that came was a Automobile Engineering kit, with a cute box and a story book.  However, the pictures in the story book don't look anything like what you can build and my son was so frustrated (and the story itself was not well written).  And while the pieces were bright, the kit was hard to put together, the pictures in the instruction book were hard to follow, the colors didn't match the actual pieces and we all got a bit frustrated with pieces that were the same color but some had odd holes on them and others didn't.  For a 3 - 4 year old this was way too hard to navigate, and an older child would find the story line juvenile. The next kit we got had a drill, colored screws and a white tray with holes on it.  This was somewhat better, as pattern cards were included.  Unfortunately, wasn't very interesting.  The third kit was a cheaply executed maze game that you put together.<br /><br />This club doesn't seem to be actually curated.

He needs parental assistance for most of the projects, but that's expected.<br /><br />I like that it comes every 2 months with about 8 projects (we do about 1 a week). I like that there's a variety in types of projects. I really like that it keeps him off of watching shows for awhile. I don't like that coloring pages are sometimes counted as 1 activity (it counted in rocket and dinosaur boxes). I don't like that we're accumulating tons of markers are crayons and such.

There is a theme such as November in Kyoto and December in Sapporo. It may seem pricey, but it is a lot cheaper than going to Japan. I have been introduced to many new snacks and look forward to receiving this box. By the way, it is very nicely packaged.",Subscription_Boxes

I was very very thankful but that plant was half dead too and is to tall to stand up without large wood sticks and still isn't coming around sadly.

Beyond that, every project we have tried has had a minimum of 3 errors in the diagram to the point where the instructions actually contradict themselves.<br /><br />Finally, (and this was the last straw for me) the &#34;catapult&#34; used as an example of a lever was supposed to be used by flipping it with a finger. Catapults use tension (and levers) but even though it would have been idiotically simple to add a rubber band, these &#34;STEM experts&#34; were apparently happier to ignore the concept of tension and just flick the toy across the room.

Is price a better value this way or if purchased as child is ready or if child EARNS it as in when ready for next stage.<br />These are my recommendations for how to view the reviews of those who HAVE purchased the STEM program. When/if I DO sign any of my Gkids up for it, I'll evaluate it in detail. I hope this won't be rejected because I haven't purchased the program. Knowing HOW to make the decision based on the reviews of others is important. I make this statement as a physician who had spent MANY YEARS reading copious medical journals deciding how patients will best benefit from products w/o being influenced by the hype of advertising but on the basis of what is best for the INDIVIDUAL patient sitting in front of me. I use the same criteria when choosing products for my Gkids.",Subscription_Boxes

4,B07QWV8P2L,2020-01-22 20:05:12.284,"Awesome indie brand makeup box, known for bright colors! I’ve noticed most of the bad reviews for this box on here are people saying this box should be for kids and they weren’t wanting bright and neon makeup colors, well that’s what this brand is known for and they do a great job of it! If you don’t like bright colors and trying new products that are often a bit daring, then this box is NOT for you. However I am 30 years old and I absolutely love the glitters and bright colors often featured in this box, they apply beautifully and can be worn subtly if you know to apply them. I will say their monthly boxes can be hit or miss, so I usually like to see what’s going to be featured in their boxes for the month before I commit to buy through Amazon (which is so easy to do on here compared to through their site). For example their December box was a huge hit for me (pictured), but I just wasn’t feeling their January so I’ll likely pick up again in February. Love that they’re a cruelty free brand and they do have wonderful, innovative products. Definitely would recommend for other makeup obsessed people who aren’t afraid to use bright shades!",Subscription_Boxes

I wanted to give my kids something interesting since we are all stuck at home during lockdown, so I decided to spring for a snack box subscription. I chose Japanese snacks because I can't eat gluten and on occasion, they have rice-based snacks so even I can join in the fun sometimes. Through a series of bizarre circumstances I accidentally ordered a ""Tokyo Treat"" brand box AND this Bokksu in the same month, and it was too late to cancel when I found out. I can say that this box is absolutely better. I has full descriptions, interesting information, allergen info, and a really nice selection. It says they are premium quality and they really are -- this isn't gas station crap, it's delicious. The kids love it, and I like it, too. As far as value for money, it's a little pricey but it's coming from Japan, and in my box everything arrived whole and in good condition. I like that it comes with tea, too.<br /><br />The short version is that this is definitely better than Tokyo Treat, and it's cheaper, and it's a really nice and interesting thing that kids enjoy and so do I.

My huby is from Japan, and we travel there a lot, and the items which came are specialty snacks from partcular regions of Japan, as advertised. It was fun to try the different ones over several days. I think the price is a bit high, but people have to make money and the items are not your standard snacks in grocery stores. But relative to a box of good chocolates which with shipping costs comes to around $100, this is a good deal for Valentines Day or Birthday gifts, and its more fun to try than a box of differnt chocolates.

I've been very happy with the type of toys and quality of toys I've been sent the last five months (3 to 4 year old option) though they lean a bit heavy toward engineering and not enough technology, science or math IMHO, BUT my last shipment was charged a hefty shipment fee, regardless of the fact that the subscription terms promise free shipping. When I called to correct the problem, I was put on hold repeatedly and read FAQ files that had nothing to do with my problem. After 30 minutes of repeatedly explaining that I wanted the shipping charges removed because the subscription promises free shipping, the representative finally cancelled my shipment completely. I am not sure what would have happened if I hadn't called before the toy had actually shipped. Would I have had to return the toy? Pay for return shipping? Just eat the shipping charges that month? I'm sure the result would have been something annoyin since it was  apparently completely impossible to simply remove the shipping charge.<br /><br />Anyway, keep an eye out for stealth shipping charges and be prepared for a 30 minute call that culminates in losing your shipment for the month to ""fix it.""",Subscription_Boxes

The snacks tended to be of a higher quality and diversity than you get in typical Japanese snack boxes which tend to be mostly kiddie snacks.  It is a bit on the pricey side, but if the shipments continue to be of the quality of the initial shipment, I feel it will be worth the price for the exposure to higher quality and somewhat unique products.  Of course the initial subscriber fee went down AFTER I purchased it, but that's life.  Still feel it is a worthwhile purchase based upon initial impressions.  Also do like the in-box guide/booklet.<br /><br />Update:  Have been a subscriber for just shy of a year and have to say I have really enjoyed the monthly boxes and plan to continue receiving.  I look forward to seeing what arrives each month.  Though I may not like every item in the package, I have also found some items that I have absolutely loved and have even ordered more of them directly from the company.

Upon receiving the boxes, however, I was disappointed with the size of the items and even though there were a variety of things, I knew it fell short in value compared to what they were actually charging for tiny samples of treats. I cancelled my subscription last month and received an email confirming my cancellation.  Fast forward to now, I received an email at 3am stating my subscription has been reinstated and renewed without my authorization.  I have read previously of this happening to many others and thought this was a glitch or something they would’ve fixed by now. But I realize now upon perusing their website that the option to manually cancel the subscription (the actual link and button) has been removed and now they’ve created another hoop for you to jump through just to cancel something you never reinstated.

5,B07MGJZ2MH,2019-07-09 02:06:13.991,"Very cool selection, but not good for folks with celiac. Our bokksu was a neat collection of snacks that were a fun experiment. Some tasted good, even though they also tasted strange and unfamiliar. Others were just plain delicious. The Bokksu came from Japan fresh and in perfect condition and the child unit we did this for was thrilled. We lucked out and got a box (July 2019) where only four items had wheat, which we promptly handed to Dad. The rest was safe to eat. Unfortunately, looking forward one month and back one month, those boxes had almost all products with wheat and only a couple that didn’t have wheat. Since we have celiac, that makes this interesting cultural exploration not as useful. Guess we’ll make the rounds of the local Asian markets and see if we can make our own collections. Too bad, this is a fantastic idea. It’s also cool that they have a vegetarian option. I’d recommend this for those without an allergy to wheat. That said, another very useful feature is the booklet, which lists the common allergens in each snack.<br /><br />Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

The dark greyish silver lip lacquer and bright blue mascara were really disappointing though. Frankly, really disappointing.  The gold highlighting powder and the mauve eyeshadow were a bit better but still pretty boring.

The coconut sable cookies are good, too. Oh so was the One-bite Wagashi Matcha Warabi Mochi although I had to eat it in several bites because it's too much for one bite really. So fun!!!

This was so big, I was thinking the large might also be too big so I got 1 size smaller..  Overall, the t-shirt I got was very ugly. I would never wear it even if it was the right size.

She said it requires a skill set and level of concentration 3-year-olds just don't possess and that if he were a couple of years older it would have been perfect.  My own former 3-year-olds are much older now, but from the way my sister described the box's contents (vs. the description), I'd agree.

Perhaps they do have some snacks there as well, but they can't be similar to what it is in this box. They are handmade snacks and it makes them to be even more special.

My son had absolutely zero interest in the activity book (at 4 years old he’s already burnt out on stuff like tracing letters and matching colors). He did have a fun putting the stickers on the suitcase, and with each sticker I showed him the corresponding continent on the map.

I got some kind of citrus-themed box. Now, citrus is not one of my favorite flavor types, though I don't hate it, either. So, this boxed was a mixed bag for me. There were some absolutely amazing lemon cookies, which I was not able to find online when I went to see if I could buy just them anywhere. There was a filled bun thing that was pretty good, too. There were other things that I tasted and tossed without finishing. There was definitely a lot of variety in products, which was nice, and the pamphlet explaining things was helpful. But for me, there were maybe two items that were really good, at least three or four which I didn't care for at all, and some others that were interesting and not too bad but nothing amazing. Now, if it had been a chocolate-themed box, it might have been entirely different. For $40/month, it's just not worth the gamble to me. I'd probably buy it if I could buy individual boxes that interested me, rather than the random sub thing, but for $40/month, that's too much money for me to want to bet on the curated randomness (random to me) of this sub box. But if you're a lot more open to different foods and really enjoy lots of different things, maybe it'll be more worth it to you. It definitely looked well put together.",Subscription_Boxes

Urge you put me outside and tell me to grow plants you'll see huge plants with lots of produce on it. If you give me an indoor plant it's guaranteed I'll kill it. When I got this little plant I tried very hard to remember to water it but I sort of forgot and I thought it was going to die. But this plant is so hardy that even though most of the leaves turn yellow and fell over it survived my neglect! And there is even a new Leaf growing! This was my very first one I'm expecting another one the second week of April but just to see that I didn't kill an indoor plant shows how good and Hardy these little house plants are. I grew up in a flower shop & Greenhouse but I never quite mastered the indoors and I am so grateful to The Growers for such a Hardy and wonderful little plant. I'll see what the next plant looks like and how it reacts to my sometimes neglect and after a few more I'll come back and maybe give an even better review.,Subscription_Boxes

I got this for myself because Ive been dealing with cancer way too long and wanted something to look forward to. Even knowing it was coming, the Bokksu box was unexpected just because it is SO COMPLETELY DELIGHTFUL. I think this would make a really thoughtful gift for anyone who needs hope to hang on another month; for that person who has everything already maybe, and for anyone who needs a little joy from something that’s not another gift “thing” that gets dusty.  I think the overall superior quality of the box - packaging, flavor, education, surprise element and variety - makes me think I’ll buy more and that friends will really enjoy these.<br /><br />Bokksu did provide helpful customer service when I contacted them which is appreciated. The tasting box arrived early - a full 12 days ahead of schedule, so I think the large window is just to set reasonable expectations...<br /><br />The box is just WONDERFUL. The snacks so far have been super fresh and not a single one was broken or disturbed, so they were maybe even I guess thoughtfully placed in the box ? They are incredibly tasty and thoughtfully picked out - a really good variety of flavors, textures, sweet, salty, hot, traditional, weird (appreciated) and containing both subtle and much more complex tastes than that half crushed bag of prawn chips from the boba shop. This is produced so very nicely. Well done, Bokksu ! 👏👏👏<br /><br />Just to add I think this will last a while - I’ve already tasted a good number of things but the snack quantities are good enough and the flavors more interesting and filling enough too that - it should prevent eating the entire box in one or two sittings lol. We can hope. 😂",Subscription_Boxes

3,B07QWV8P2L,2020-06-07 01:44:36.840,"I love that it's vegan, but the colors were sort of out there. I was really excited to see a makeup subscription box that was 100% vegan and cruelty free. I received 4 products in mine: a lipstick, a loose glitter, an eyeshadow, and a ""tinted"" lip balm. The lipstick is gorgeous and I think I can use the eyeshadow, but as a metallic silver, it might be more of a liner color for me. I have no idea what I would use the glitter for. The lip balm is super hydrating and feels good, but it is this mod light yellow shade that reminds me a lot of the concealer lip trend of the naughts. I will probably use the balm at night just to hydrate and not as an actual makeup product.<br /><br />I absolutely adore the bright pink color of the lipstick, but the other three products are probably not going to get a lot of use. I like the company and looking at their website I do see some things I am interested in trying.  Medusa's Makeup is a lot like Urban Decay where their overall aesthetic is edgy, but they have products for everyone. I will probably not do the subscription box again. I tend to wear natural looking makeup with maybe a pop of color in the lipstick or eyeliner, so I don't think this is for me. If you are someone who loves to try out bright, avant guard looks or goes out a lot this subscription box will be a lot of fun for you.",Subscription_Boxes

Sometimes they said they were sending a certain item and then a different toy was sent by mistake(this was taken care of by amazon customer support though). Maybe my main thing i didnt like was at the 3-4 level they still sent toys that had small parts that are a choking hazard.

I opened and watered in the sink and let drain, I follow the directions for watering and the plant is growing and looking really good. I got the first plant in mid May and let it acclimate until the next plant came and then I transplanted into a bigger planter and it's doing great. The second plant came mid June and was in just as good shape. I really like the cards that come with them that tell you what you have and how to care for it.

Out of the eight products, only two could possibly be called a product specifically for redheads. I can buy moisturizer by myself. I was looking for product specifically for people with red hair, which is what this said it was. One of the items, a make up bag, mentions the gene related to being redhaired and claims to be worth $25, and there is nobody on the planet that would pay $25 for it. It literally is a dollar store quality bag. Additionally, all the women they showcase in their marketing materials have very dark red hair and a complexion that matches. Most likely, women that have dyed their hair red. For someone that is a traditional redhead like me, with super pale light skin and an orange-ish red color, even the products they sent that could be marketed specifically for redheads isn’t really what I’m looking for. The eyebrow pencil makes my eyebrows, which are normally a strawberry blonde color, look almost black. It looks completely ridiculous and unnatural. I’m going to give them one more chance, but then I’m going to cancel. Super disappointing.

I signed up the first month and my 3-4 yo did not get the aircraft kit (so, not sure why Amazon says that was an item in past boxes) when I got the first box and did not get that. The math kit, subscription or not, was not a cool item. My 4 year old played with it for 5 minutes, mastered it, and moved on.

First, regarding the quality; the boxes, accompanying literature, and the wrappers of each individual item in the boxes are striking.  The boxes themselves are refined and as solid as paper boxes can be.  I never received a damaged box or box with damaged contents.  Not a single item ever arrived stale.  I receive an email from Japan every few months notifying me that someone has mailed something to my address.  I'm not 100% sure but these might be the Bokksus because they seem to arrive shortly thereafter.  Everyone who saw the booklets commented on how beautiful the photographs were.  As to the contents, there's a good variety of sweet and savory in each box.  I like the little cakes and pastries the most, followed by the different types of tea.  I'm not as enamored with the hard candies that often leaves me feeling that I'm sucking on a sugar ball colored with artificial dyes.  I guess I expected more punch with natural flavors.  As several others have noted, the cost is rather high for a box full of snack items one might find on the impulse buying racks at a checkout lane at a convenience store.  Having lived in Japan before, I can say that while they taste good, some of the items, especially the salty snacks are pretty inexpensive to purchase there.  Taking into account the cost of shipping from Japan and the need for profit margin however, I suppose this is understandable.  I find myself having a hard time keeping up with the arrival of the next box.  That is, a new one arrives before I've finished the previous one.

So far we've gotten two boxes, one arcade themed and the other shark themed. Both were high quality and absolutely packed with fun activities. The types of games varied greatly from card games to board games, truth or dare, and even a small shooting gallery that had to be set up in a hallway!<br /><br />While some of the games are just for fun, others are designed to help you get to know your partner a little better. After the shark themed date night box, I now know my wife has no fear of clowns but is scared of heights. We've been together for years, yet I never knew this, and these are the little things that draw couples closer. Other games encouraged you to talk about the past or to even open up some relationship secrets (i.e. ""What's the worst thing that your partner has made for you?""). The questions and prompts never got too serious, which I've noticed is a complaint for some earlier boxes.<br /><br />One of the best things about both of the boxes we've received is that there are more date activities than are used in the prompts. The arcade box included a deck of cards that had different date ideas on them; the prompt only used the cards, but never the ideas. They were a complete extra. The value for the money spent is incredible. We were hesitant to try Crated With Love out at $30 a month, but after one box we could tell that we were getting far more for our money than many other $30 date ideas.<br /><br />We look forward to future boxes!",Subscription_Boxes

We had the September box that was themed around Napa Valley. It helped both of us speak positive things about each other through the evening. Sometimes as couples it can be easy to fall into a routine with kids and speak when needed and and tough things come up more than some positive.

4,B004793SU4,2019-11-22 02:20:24.884,"Stinks, but is Feasible or Price Competative. From my research, this product is designed to be used between drywall containing a separation instead of mud filled corners.  Doing so likely requires covering the caulked gaps with some sort of trim boards.  The gaps also likely need to be consistent or eye pleasingly straight, rather than just pushing a mass of (hot) mud into the ceiling corners!<br /><br />STINKY<br />This stuff really stinks up the room compared to other caulks on the market nowadays having less VOC content.  Also, this caulk requires a longer dry time when filling in gaps larger then 1/8-1/4 inches.  Only 1/16 inch layer will dry within ~24 hours.<br /><br />COST<br />Compared to standard ""Sherwin-Williams 850A Acrylic Latex Caulk 10.1oz"" @ 1.69 a tube, an equivalent amount would require ~34 tubes for a total cost of $57.46.  However, acrylic/latex will likely shrink or may crack, compared to this product here.<br /><br />MATERIAL CONSISTENCIES<br />I believe the Green Glue caulk and other Green Glue materials are silicone based containing likely petroleum based products.  Spend a little more and purchase a cheap box store silicone caulk, might get you just as good as a seal with similar shrinkage compared to this product.  However, a Sherwin WIlliams silicone caulk tends to be twice as much as their acrylic latex  caulk, in which case might be best to just purchase a product (such as Green Glue caulk) already having a sound rating and designed for defeating noise due to it's engineered mass.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br />It stinks, really bad, but based on price comparison with similar products I would likely purchase again unless I'm constrained by budget or interior air quality issues.  If you are engineering/constructing a designated sound proof area, go for it, and just prepared to deal with the stink and long dry times.  If you're just being cautious with noise, have no time available for dry times, or have poor air circulation for resolving the stink while the caulk dries; can likely either use a basic acrylic latex caulk (~50% the cost of this product) or siliconized acrylic at ~75-85% the cost of this product.",Tools_and_Home_Improvement

I'm using this on a bookshelf in a windowless hallway and it does a nice job providing accent light in a location where we don't have an outlet. It's a nice looking lamp made with a unique design and made with solid materials. It's on the heavy side and feels and looks well made. My only complaint about the design is the on/off touch sensor at the top - it's white plastic and lights up when the light is on which in my opinion disrupts the overall design of the lamp.<br /><br />The lamp doesn't come with much in the way of instructions but I found it intuitive to assemble (screw the top to the base, that's it) and use. Initial charge time is quite long, more than five hours long, so hopefully that translates to long battery life. Keeping the light plugged into an outlet isn't really practical as the charging port is located under the shade of the lamp, not at the base, so a cord would be very visible.<br /><br />The LED color is a soft white and can be dimmed by long pressing the on/off sensor on the top of the shade. At its highest setting I'd say that the light is still basically and accent light unless you are sitting or working very close to it.

5,B0BNMYW1VF,2023-03-18 15:24:45.312,Cute little lamp! We recently lost power during a winter storm and I was so happy to have this little light on-hand. The entire surface under the top dome is a light that can be aimed in any direction by swiveling the dome. You can also use it as a regular end table light or hang it from the loop on top. The base is nice and heavy so it won't fall over - and you can dim or brighten the light but simply holding your finger on the on/off button on top. The whole casing is metal so this light seems very durable and outdoorsy - perfect for boating or camping - especially since it's rechargeable!,Tools_and_Home_Improvement

4,B0BNMYW1VF,2023-03-20 17:12:20.070,"Modern Design Versatile Wireless Lamp. This versatile lamp has a modern look and is made from metal, which gives a little bit of weight. It has a nice black medium gloss paint. Above the touch switch, there is a small metal finger ring handle to carry the lamp. It is easy to put together, however, there are four small o-rings for the screws which are easily loseable. A major downside of this design is that you will have to remove the top portion of the lamp to charge the battery. I presume this is done so that one doesn't keep the lamp plugged in during use - the directions say not to run it while plugged in. The lamp does take quite a long time to charge, about 4 or 5 hours. I timed the run time, and on a full charge it runs 7 to 8 hours. The lamp looks like it would fit in most decors. It's perfect in size for a small desk, night stand, or bookcase. In a pinch I'd use this outdoors, but it's not practical for camping as the seller's description suggests. There's no heat from the LED lights, and they are quite bright. The dimming feature is great. The touch switch responds appropriately; one tap for on/off and long press to dim or brighten. The top portion swivels, which is a great feature. Overall, this is a great little wireless lamp.",Tools_and_Home_Improvement

5,B01LW2NN0F,2019-03-30 20:43:43.033,"Very nice valve indeed - you do need to be quite handy to replace an old USA valve. Replaced an old single-handle Moen valve in a stall shower with this. Needed to do quite a bit of carpentry to make it work. The plumbing part was easy, however, because of Pex and Sharkbite fittings. The valve works very well. See pictures. No stars removed because of the extra work, as I knew going in what was needed.<br /><br />Update: Very pleased with this valve. MUCH easier to regulate temperature than the single-handle valves I've seen, which are much more common in the US. Definitely worth the work to install it.<br /><br />It's easy to reset the temperature where the ""stop"" is; just remove the knob - first take out the chromed insert and remove the screw - and rotate the valve stem until the temperature suits you. Then replace the knob without moving the valve stem. You can always press the button and rotate the knob to make it hotter. Remove the red insert inside the knob if you want it still hotter when you press the button to go past the stop.<br /><br />Similarly, the flow control stop point can be adjusted by removing the flow knob (the right-hand knob) and replacing it in a different position. It will shut-off ""off-center"" but this is not a bother to any of us here. Pressing the button and turning the knob further increases the flow to the maximum, no matter where you replace the knob.",Tools_and_Home_Improvement

5,B0B95ZYFB1,2022-11-04 21:19:15.603,"Very bright with good battery life and some other thoughtful features. For as small as this thing is, it is VERY bright. I was really surprised when I powered it up on the HIGH setting the first time. I'm not sure if the 100% brightness setting is actually 800 lumens, but it's bright enough to light my entire garage well enough for me to see clearly.<br /><br />The light from this flashlight is a crisp white and totally free of shadows due to the design of the LED array. It casts light over a huge area much like a floodlight would. Again, I was very surprised since the light itself is so physically small. There are 3 other modes besides the HIGH setting -- Medium (around 60% brightness, still very bright), Low (dimmer, but still usable), and strobe. The strobe effect is extremely effective and very bright. It would be a decent way to get attention in an emergency, or if you want an impromptu dance party. :)<br /><br />Battery life is good for something this small. I set up a timer and a camera to record how long it would last on full brightness. There was noticeable dimming at around the 15 minute mark, but the light was still very bright. My estimate (I have no way to test the actual lumen output) is that the light was still putting out about 60% or so of its original brightness on the HIGH setting after 45 minutes of runtime.<br />The light was only warm to the touch after the test and never got too hot to hold.<br /><br />The light comes with a small USB-A to USB-C cable that is about 6 inches long, but does not come with a power adapter. I used one of my phone chargers and it worked fine to charge the light. The USB-C port is covered by a rubber flap to keep out moisture and dirt. When charging, a large, red LED lights up to indicate the unit is actually charging. The charge indicator turns bright green when the charging cycle is complete. USB-C compatibility and the charging/charged indicator are really nice features in my opinion and unexpected on a relatively inexpensive flashlight like this.<br /><br />The back of the light is magnetic and the magnet is decently strong. It will stick to just about any iron or steel surface without sliding down. There is also a useful little flip out stand on the back to make positioning the light easy when it is sitting on a surface. The carabiner style clip at the top is also nice if you want to attach the light to a bag, keychain, etc.<br /><br />I am really happy with this light and will use it regularly to replace other larger, more cumbersome flashlights.",Tools_and_Home_Improvement

It has rather long charging time but it only holds charge 3 days or so IDLE. I don't understand why they made it even wireless if the battery doesn't hold charge.

The charging port should have been at the base if it needed to be charged constantly. Very disappointed.<br /><br />Initial review:<br />I love it! Very solid build and doesn't feel cheap. It matches with my dark minimalist decor. I placed it where the power outlet is not an easy reach and it's perfect. The downside is that you have to recharge and the charging port is at an awkward position inside of the shade that you don't want to keep plugged in (which is ok for me). At first I didn't like the white plastic piece sticking out at the top like a sore thumb but it actually illuminates when the light is on and it's growing on me.

There was a lot to it.<br />This is a very fun toy. They played with it for a while, and had a lot of fun.<br /><br />We have many toys from this company. They make a lot of different products and we have generally been very happy with them. It worked well.<br /><br />This toy was durable. My kids can be a little rough with toys, but this continued to work just fine. We had no problems<br /><br />I feel like this is good for child development. It kept my children's interest.

4,B0C3CWPZH8,2022-12-13 20:22:25.739,"Fun but noisy fidget. This Magnetic Fidget Sphere is way more fun than I thought it would be! There’s something very satisfying about building the sphere and then smashing it. I can fidget with one hand, building and crumpling the sphere, or making other shapes.<br /><br />The magnets are strong. The pentagrams snap together and take a little tug to separate, yet the toy can be reshaped without effort. It’s quite cool. However, the toy is not a quiet fidget -- the magnets are loud when they connect. The plastic bodies of the pentagrams are noisy too, so I don’t think you could use this on a call or in a meeting.<br /><br />The instructions and box have a warning: “Keep away from all children.” That’s a little contradictory to me, since the product photos show kids playing with the fidget sphere. The individual pentagrams are on the smaller side, but each magnet is half-enclosed in the sides. By that, I mean you can’t really pry them free. So unless a magnet comes loose, and kids are supervised, I’d think this would be fine for kids to fidget with.",Toys_and_Games

It is very large and, when standing, it goes above his waist (he is 5).  This was an instant favorite when my son opened this on Christmas. He has several small dinosaurs and loved having the T-Rex eat them.  Be ready for children to put several things into its mouth to see what fits and what doesn't.  My only complaint is that it does not come with a few small dinosaurs for those that might not have any yet.  This was my nephews first dinosaur toy so he didn't have any small ones for the Colossal to munch on.  Other than that, it's a fun toy and not as pricey as some of the other large Jurassic World toys.",Toys_and_Games

Our toy kitchen was really lacking in the breakfast food category, so these components are absolutely awesome for role playing. The syrup bottle is genius (not sure I’ve seen a set with that before), and the bowl of cereal is fun, as well as the bagels, waffles and pancakes. I also like how it features some healthier foods (eggs, fruit, yogurt) instead a lot the junkier breakfast treats (no muffins, no donuts), but the included cinnamon roll is a cute touch.

His last Halloween costume was Dr. Alan Grant, if that tells you anything. It's all we hear from his mouth 95% of the time. His mind lives in the world of the movies. It was his pleasure to try out these toys and then tell me his favorite things about them. For one toy, I had read some negative reviews before ordering, and I asked him about their complaint. &#34;I don't know why someone would complain about such a good toy, mama&#34;, was his response.<br /><br />This one is my favorite. I've even enjoyed playing with my children with it. It's huge. The mouth opens and you can pretend that he's eating things. It goes through a tunnel to his belly, which opens on the bottom(to retrieve toys). We've used little animals, cars, and food to play, so you don't have to buy the extra Jurassic toys if you don't want to.<br /><br />You do have to assemble one of the legs and the tail. My son said to make sure I mention he couldn't get the leg on and had to get help from his daddy.<br /><br />It does take up a good bit of room, but it's lots of fun!",Toys_and_Games

It's a little difficult to put together (the leg fell off the first few times we thought we had correctly popped it in) but after we got it right, it's very sturdy!  It also does a great job eating smaller toys.  If you put too big of a guy down there it's possible to get it stuck, but you can pretty much yank it back out with a coat hanger if you need to.

[[VIDEOID:45bd22d47c00d5c325395ed91ce0c136]] I have had something like this when I was really young, and then I actually got a rectangle one from Dave and Busters a few years ago.  This one is a circle, and I have found that I really like the circle because you don't have to just flip it, you can turn it however much you want and create even more cool things.<br />In case you don't know it is basically some sand in water stuck between two sheets of glass.  There are a bit of bubbles that are there on purpose to block the sand a bit.  There is white sand and a few shades of blue, along with a bit of gold sand.  The gold sand is very lite.  The white is finer but denser than the blue, so the white falls down first and makes a cloud, then blue comes down a bit later.  The end result is that the white and blue are more separated and they look like marble when they settle.<br /><br />You can rotate it over and over and watch it many times.  It is all very relaxing.  This one is a base and then the ring with the glass and sand in it.  I find that it looks even better when it is back lit.  You could easily put this on your desk or in a window.  The black rubber around the circle is soft and actually removable, but there is no need to do that.<br /><br />I have always liked these and this is my first circle one.  I would suggest this as a good one.",Toys_and_Games

We even had to play “rock paper scissors” to figure out who got to play with them first this morning. They’re small enough to be a good fit for little hands, but not too small to be unsafe.

So this dinosaur is absolutely amazing eye-catching and a great gift and definitely made my daughter squeal Christmas morning but let me tell you it constantly gets in the way there's nowhere really to store it and it's worse than stepping in a Lego to run into this in the middle of the night or even right and broad daylight 🤣 so I can't say I regret buying this but I thought this would be better than getting the cheaper one that's smaller and makes noise but I honestly think my daughter would have had more fun playing with that one and it was a cause a lot less injuries LOL. do you know how it is if you're a dinosaur lover you just got to have some giant ones. But even my daughter said that she doesn't really like any of the colossal dinosaurs because of how they get in the way she does like them I should say but she just gets annoyed about how much in the way they are all the time can't really set them up on a shelf because their tails get in the way you can't really put it in a toy box because they're so huge and we can't shove them underneath their bed because that's where all her extra blankets and sheets are stored so we set them out as a display almost on her floor on the side of the wall which is kind of where I was going to put her new bureau but I guess we're going to have to figure something else out because these dang dinosaurs LOL but still gave it a five star and everything because it is well built it is sturdy and it's pretty awesome when you're playing with itI just wish they could have made it a little bit more rubbery so that there's a little bit more softness to it but it still sturdy at the same time that would have been much better.,Toys_and_Games

5,B076N9JT8G,2018-05-19 23:25:59.005,Such a cool dinosaur. Even in the Box this thing looks impressive. It's approximately 3 feet from nose to tail which is quite big in person. You can't tell until you take it out of the box but the leg and tail and stomach flap are detached so you have to assemble them. It's pretty straightforward although we did have to kind of jam the leg in to get it to pop into place. Everything moves easily and the jaw opens super wide which is really fun. My four-year-old got a huge kick out of this because it was essentially big enough for him to ride on. All the details looks super cool up close to. If you're a Jurassic fan or a dinosaur fan you won't be disappointed.,Toys_and_Games

I will say that the tv commercial hyped up the toy a bit and made it seem like it did more than it actually does. But my biggest complaint is the fact that the toy does not stand up well at all. It tips over with the slightest bump & unless the feet are positioned perfectly , it falls over. Making it a little difficult for my little boy to play with it.

The magnets are strong enough to hold it together without falling apart.  I ordered this for my 9-year-old grandson and he plays with it often while watching television or on downtime.  I like this fidget sphere as when he gets overwhelmed he seems to gravitate toward playing with it without being prompted.  This toy does achieve the goal of what a fidget is designed to do.  I have since ordered three of these for Easter gifts.,Toys_and_Games

5,B076N9JT8G,2018-07-26 17:11:52.232,"She big, she tol, but mostly she eat them all. Silly title aside, I have to say this figure is astounding! Rexy/Reburta, the world famous Tyrannosaurus from Jurassic Park & World, comes to life (again) in this enormous figure. If you're wondering how big she is, she measures about three feet in length and stands about eleven inches high at the hip, and that's if you have her the walking pose. Otherwise, this baby can go into one tall tripod stance. She is very stable, and I've only had one of mine fall over when on some thick carpet, but that could have been because I didn't have her legs moved into a position where she could balance.<br /><br />The detailing is terrific as well, with my only complaint if I had to have one is her finger claws aren't painted. Which in all brutal honesty is not a big deal to me. I will also add that this particular JP/JW T-Rex does not roar, the only feature she has is the ability to swallow small dinosaurs (the grab bag ones seen on the box) or maybe small defenseless toys. If you want the roaring colossal Rex, then I suggest trying to buy one at Walmart as she comes with both roaring and 'eating' features.<br /><br />I will also add that you have to put her leg and tail on her body, which beats the 'bent tail syndrome' the old but awesome Kenner line came with. The tail pops in rather easily and even has a nice outline, so you don't accidentally put it in upside down, (something I did with one of my smaller t-rexes.) The leg, however, can require some muscle as you pop it into place and while I don't suggest going full-on 'hulk mode' on it, I do suggest pressing her leg into the socket until you hear an audible click (you'll know when you hear it). The best outcome I had with the two that I have was laying her on her side and pressing the leg into the socket, as I'm a fairly small adult with not a lot of muscle on me, but that being said this figure is not hard to put together. I also suggest before giving this to your kid for playtime that you move the leg several times to make sure it's in the socket to avoid it falling off.<br /><br />Lastly, this figure has several points of mobility. Her mouth opens astonishingly wide (I can fit my hand and part of my arm into her mouth and throat), the ankles can swivel to add stability, her legs, arms, and tail can also move, Her legs can move to allow her to stand in a very tall tripod stance or down to where she is sniffing the floor (or maybe drinking water). Her arms can be moved up or down, and her tail can move side to side.<br /><br />All in all, I'm an extremely happy collector, and I smile every time I see the fantastic work Mattel did to bring Rexy back to life since the tragedy that was the Hasbro line. &#60;_&#60; I cannot give this figure enough praise and if you're a collector I hope you buy this because she is an excellent addition to anyone's shelf or toy box.",Toys_and_Games

[[VIDEOID:ad64fec2e83c71373a4a035ad6423f29]] I work as a graphics designer, and my old keyboard was getting to the point that half of the keys were no longer working. I needed something functional (as well as really cool looking because - hey, why not?) This keyboard / mouse combo fit the bill. Let's start off with the keyboard. I work at night alot of the time and this is perfect. It has a backlit keyboard and it is quite easy to use in the dark when I don't want to bother with turning on a light. It has a very comfortable keyboard and a nice click when you hit the keys.  I am not sure if the keyboard changes colors or not, but the orange is easy on the eyes and comfortable to work in the dark with for extended periods of time. The cord is made of a heavy duty braided cloth material and looks like it will hold up for a long time to come. I still have not used all of the function available on the keyboard yet, but you can control your music, email, homepage and a bunch of other things that I am figuring out daily. It also comes with a really nice gaming mouse. The mouse also comes with a heavy duty cord and it has the ability to change colors. It has a handy scrolling wheel in the center and a forward and back button on the right hand side. For the price, this is a great combo and I would recommend this to anyone.",Video_Games

This is not the Silver Star Edition. Don't be mistaken. The difference in price between the SSE and the standard is only a couple dollars, but those 2 dollars paid for the entire suite of DLC that costs about 20 if you buy it from Xbox Live. The DLC is included on disk in the SSE so it's not a simple case of a code being used, this is the standard edition misrepresented as the SSE. The sticker on the back even says SSE when it is not. That being said, the game is fun but I'm not going to waste a week sending it back hoping for the replacement to be the correct version of the game. I don't feel like I've been cheated, because I'm probably not going to get the DLC thought and that sucks a bit.",Video_Games

I've played all the demos so far, and even got some time with a friend's German copy.<br /><br />It's got some solid gameplay. I couldn't find any bugs, and the units are nicely balanced. And unlike most other RTS of late, there are no pathing issues! It's nice to issue a movement command and watch the infantry and tanks actually follow a sensible route from point A to point B. The lack of good pathing drove me crazy in Heroes of WWII.<br /><br />Graphically, it's pretty tasty. Even zoommed in tight, unit markings are clear and true-to-life.<br /><br />I'd say go for this over Heroes of WWII. It won't tax your PC nearly as much, yet it looks just as good.

3,B07DK6YN1N,2018-10-28 14:26:02.461,This Review is for XBox One Users. I’ve had TRITTON headphones in the past and they do have great sound quality for the price. In the description and pictures for this headset they say it can be used with Xbox One. When I received the item the box had no where on it that it’s compatible. I do know the original Xbox one controllers had to have an adapter but I have the newer one with the 3.5 mm plug. My biggest concern with any headset I buy is echoing. For some reason some headsets have huge problems with this. And this one does. DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE AN XBOX ONE. Especially if you plan to use it for multiplayer. Even with the mic button turned off it was showing on the screen that feedback was coming from my mic. They sound great especially for the price but the mic problems is a dealbreaker and I had to return.,Video_Games

The story is just rushed, the disney worlds all feel like ads for there movies (Not that you need to watch them as the plots on the worlds is 1:1 copies of them movie but they tossed Sora Donald and Goofy in).

This was a decently fun game but I did find myself getting bored with the repetitiveness of it.  I'll break it down into pros&cons.<br /><br />PROS<br />-If you like the sniper type character builds in most games this will be a fun experience.  Worth it if the cost is only a few dollars.<br />-There is *some* variation in the game which allows for a different approach to tackling problems.  This is very limited, however.<br /><br />CONS<br />-The variation in the game is limited, just enough to keep it interesting to play to the end.  I found myself wondering a couple of times if I even wanted to start it up again because I knew the next level would be a copy of the last.<br />-The AI is frustrating (at least on the hardest level).  Instead of enemies being difficult to sight they move erratically and are impossible to track with the scope.  I understand this was on the most difficult level, but I would have hoped that the difficulty represented something other than just illogical body movements.<br /><br />Overall I'd say this is a very basic game, fun to play but nothing to really write home about.",Video_Games

The game card slot cutout has a bumper in front of the tab you need to lift to access the slot. If you have long nails, it's probably easy enough to stick a nail down there and pull it up. But with short nails, you need to use more of your fingertip which is impossible with the front bumper in the way. So in order to change out games, I have to take the whole case off.  Unfortunately, this is enough of a hassle to warrant a return. The case is easy enough to get on and off, but I'm not sure how well it or the switch will fare having to remove it so frequently.",Video_Games

5,B0002BJNV4,2004-08-07 14:15:46.000,"Reminds me of an all-time favorite. As a long time wargamer (I've been involved in the hobby more than 30 years), I've come to appreciate a wide range of games.  In the end, ""is it fun?"" should be the most important question asked, and Codename Panzers responds with a resounding ""yes!""<br /><br />While there is something to be said for hardcore simulations and games that stick to the historical record on every details, such games can be a chore to play and beyond the opening setup, one really isn't replicating history anyway.  Of all the computer wargames I've played (and I've played almost all of them over the years), my favorite was probably the highly-abstracted, ""lite"" wargame, Panzer General by SSI.<br /><br />Codename: Panzers has a number of elements that bring back fond memories of this old classic.  As one moves through the campaigns, ""prestige"" earned by winning battles can be spent to purchase more troops for one's force.  Units that acquit themselves well in battle earn experience, making them more effective in combat.  While it is most definitely a strategy game, these elements help develop an attachment to particular troops not unlike characters in an RPG.  Finally, the player's alter-ego can earn medals by accomplishing his missions well.<br /><br />Graphically, the game looks terrific.  Codename: Panzers is among the games defining the new standard in graphical excellence when it comes to realtime strategy games.  Virtually everything in the environment is destructable, adding greatly to the immersion factor that provides a compelling cinematic experience.<br /><br />The missions, not unlike Panzer General, start easy and progressively become more difficult.  Early on, one can get by using armor alone, but as the missions become more complex, combined arms operations are needed.<br /><br />Codename: Panzers is a fair degree closer to historically accurate modeling than Panzer General, but those harboring high requirements in this regard should look to another CDV-published series, Combat Mission, for a better account.  Some targets respond predicably when hit with certain weapons, others, however, require ""attrition"" to finally eliminate them.  It wasn't tens of hits that destroyed powerful tanks - it was often one properly-placed shell immobilizing the unit or destroying it outright.  Lines of sight are too short, as are engagement distances, particularly with armor.  On the flip side, however, A Tiger tank takes very little damage to a head-on shot by a Sherman.  The comparitive features and abilities of the units feels authentic, even if the implementation of the game system leans toward the abstract.  The net effect is a fun game to play, and I approve of the results.",Video_Games
5,B0002BJNV4,2005-02-10 17:06:25.000,"Mind boggling. This is the most realistic Tank Sim, I've seen to date period. Any time you can actually see the tracks on a tank moving, like real life, a lot of enthusiam had to go into it. The tanks look realistic, and everything else. If a gamer cannot appreciate the time and effort the company put into this game he,or she is not a true gamer. The soldiers run and walk,and crawl, like they do in real life. The tanks move and sound like they do in real life. If anyone is having trouble getting through a mission, feel free to e-mail me at ,,,,rome3rn@msn.com.

I am so glad that Lafayette is on this game unlike others that only give you the main schools. I love the hitters eye and the total control you have in this game. It is so realistic, its unreal. I have kept one of my players for a fifth year. Building your own stadium is great, you can build every aspect of it from top to bottom. You can create a player and give the player any look you want to and even set his hot and cold zones. You can control everything he does on the field, its amazing. I love the way I can see the release of the ball with the push of a button and react to it as I would if I were in that batters box. To us this game is more exciting than most or all of the other games and we have played many of them all the way back to Griffey Jr on the N64.

Once I complete this game on normal I will then change the difficulty level to the most difficult.  I recommend watching one of the clips for this game on youtube.com.  The movement of your character is great.  You have a multitude of weapons and explosives to use and they are quite easy to switch between them.  You may want to be covert in some areas so you have a trusty pistol with a silencer to be used at your discretion.  I just can't say enough about how much I enjoy this game.

3,B08G8MNNW9,2020-06-14 21:02:28.997,"My Everyday Gamer 11-Year-Old Not a Fan of This Headset. My son games way too much on his PC.  He has had numerous headsets over the years.  How he keeps wearing them out is beyond me, but this is the first headset he's ever refused to use for gaming.<br /><br />Let me explain.  The plug on the headset has both a USB plug and a 3.5mm plug.  Usually, the USB is all that is needed for a headset to work perfectly for my son's gaming PC.  So, he plugged in the USB, and there was ZERO response from his computer.  His computer has no idea that anything is even plugged in.  The only indication that it's even plugged in is that the headset illuminates.  However, there is NO SOUND in the headphones and the mic does not work, either.  I tried the headset on a different laptop, and the result was the same.  So, it definitely was not his PC that was to blame.<br /><br />I went on the internet to try to figure it out.  I found some people claim that if you plug in the USB AND the 3.5mm plug at the same time, then it works.  So, I tried that.  Indeed, I could hear sound through the headphones.  I wasn't sure if the mic was working or not.  I showed this to my son, and he immediately dismissed their functionality.  Sure, they illuminated and you could hear sound, but when he spoke into the mic, he could not hear himself in the headphones, which is a standard performance feature in a gaming headset, he tells me.<br /><br />Aside from the problem of not being able to hear yourself speaking into the mic through the headphones, this headset seems well made, durable, comfortable, and functional.  Unfortunately, my son puts a lot of value in being able to hear himself when speaking into the mic.<br /><br />For an entry-level headset, this product is fine.  Maybe the problem for my son is that he's gotten used to better headsets than entry level.  The functionality he considers ""standard"" may not be standard at this price point.",Video_Games

3,B00A8306C6,2013-06-21 13:39:19.000,"Fun for the first few missions. Got this one due to recommendations.<br /><br />It was good for the price.  The game itself has a great premise and the story is typical &#34;go to this scene, take out the bad guys, do the stuff.&#34;<br /><br />Couple of things that could have made this OK game a great game.<br /><br />1.)  The game is VERY linear.  Although there are many ways to do the missions, they ultimately offer one way to finish it - and that way is pretty clear every time - with cut-scenes and everything.<br />2.)  Sneaking is done so much better in other games-- I am a big fan of any game that allows sneaky-sniper gameplay.  I am comfortable finding a hiding place and observing the badguys do their rounds for however long it takes to make the perfect shot.  I was hoping to have that in this game, but it is simply not the case.<br />3.)  Related to the previous point- They are big on bad guys spawning in areas you have previously cleared, bad guys that inexplicably know exactly where you are no matter what type of precautions you take, and bad guys that have amazing shots with weapons that clearly are inferior to the weapon that my character has been granted.  I am patient.  I have no problem restarting missions specifically because I didn't do a task the way that I wanted to do it (regardless of whether that leads to points or achievements).  And I love to explore the minds of videogame designers to find every nook that they programmed into their games.  I am all about a challenge.  But their incredible laziness with regards to game mechanics and &#34;bad-guy realism&#34; is laughable and frustrating at the same time.<br /><br />If this thing shows up on your radar for 10 dollars or less, then buy it - they have awesome wind and scope physics...  My biggest beef is the way they program your adversaries.",Video_Games

4,B0002BJNV4,2004-07-14 14:02:34.000,"A lot like WW2, but with a pause button... Ingredients:<br />1 cup Blitzkrieg<br />2 tsp A Bridge Too Far<br />Mixed statistics and HE shells<br />Big dollop of history<br />For anyone who ever wanted to click their way through World War 2, this latest real-time-strategy game from CDV may be just the thing.  Players take on the role of German, British, American and Russian commanders, boldy leading platoons of little polygonal troops to death or glory.  And it's really rather cool, n'all.<br />Viewed from above the battlefield, players can rotate, pan and tilt the camera to get the best view of the action, zooming out for a wider look at the field, or zooming in to watch individual soldiers take aim.  'Panzers boast an impressive variety of units, all highly detailed and distinctive, so you'll have no trouble telling them apart once things get frantic.  Its quite a thrill to see infantry squads taking cover behind meticulously modeled walls and hedgerows, machine gun crews going prone and setting up their weapon bipods and the grit and decals clearly visible on armored units.<br />Like CDV's other RTS, Blitzkrieg, players must carefully manage and defend their units, since every squad that survives the mission will be carried forward to the next battle.  In addition, battle-hardened troops gain experience that boosts their accuracy and mobility, so it's worth playing smart.  To bolster your ranks you can purchase additional troops or vehicles before each mission.  The game currency is 'prestige', earned principally by completing missions.  It's possible to recieve a prestige bonus by completing a mission with few casualties, inflicting lots of damage on your foes or by finishing in record time, and there is immense replay value in trying to gain maximum points.  Naturally, the practical payoff of careful planning will be more units to command next time around.  Each completed mission concludes with a report from the battle, grading your performance, and this can be a real help in taking on the next challenge, seeing what you can do better etc.<br />There are lots of options to play around with on the battlefield; all units can be commanded to alter their behaviour, responding aggressively to threats or remaining passive (great for ambushes).  In addition, infantry can be instructed to move crouched, or to crawl, which adds another dimension to your strategy.  Infantry units can also occupy buildings and take control of captured vehicles - like Blitzkrieg, it's possible to take out a gun crew, for example, and then make off with the weapon, swelling your combat effectiveness mid-game.  It's even possible to gently persuade tank crews to bail out by super-heating their ride with flamethrowers or molotov cocktails!  Many units have alternate weapons, including grenades, landmines and rubber boats, so there's almost always more than one way to complete your objective.  Battlefield support is often available in the form of bombers, recon planes or artillery.  Like in Blitzkrieg, planes can't be directly controlled, rather, given a starting objective, so you need to use them wisely.<br />Everything in the game is rendered in loving detail, and the maps are no exception.  There's an astonishing amount of attention paid to buildings (which can be reduced to shattered shells with sustained fire), and plenty of wonderful ambient details - grass and trees that sway in the wind, birds that flap lazily about, and the water effects are among the best I've ever seen in a strategy title.  It's a pleasure to lead your troops through such varied locations, from the hedgerows of France to the frozen streets of Stalingrad.  There's even a working weather - (in pouring rain your heavy armor may find itself bogged down) and a functioning day/night cycle that throws up new gameplay possibilities - why not wait until darkness falls to sneak your platoon right down the enemy's throat?<br />Mid-game cut sequences, using the game engine, occur periodically to highlight objectives or spotlight a particular event.  Its a simple but effective way of introducing story elements into the game, and makes the whole sha-bang feel all the more personal.  Another nice touch is the inclusion of a game speed button - it's possible to compress time for those long trips, or pause the action.  The real boon of the pause function is that you can still rotate the view and issue orders in this mode.  Large battles become a lot more manageable as a result, since you can pause the game, rattle off intructions, and then unpause and see how it all plays out.  The fog of war, a common RTS element is present and correct, but 'Panzers throws the factor of sound into the mix...visual icons represent when your troops can hear, but not see, enemy troops or vehicles.  There's a great sense of tension as you and your men hear the rumble of approaching armor, waiting to see what emerges from the fog...a platoon of tiger tanks anyone?<br />Any downsides?  Well, you'll need a decent computer to get the most from all the graphical effects, although my P.4 handles it smoothly enough at 1280x960.  CDV is a German publisher, and its pretty clear that all the English language, spoken and written, was translated from the original - non-sequiters and strange phrasings pop up in the mission briefings, and some of the soldier chatter is rather iffy.  Still, there's so much charm on display here that it matters nought.  Also, much like the WW2 action game Call Of Duty, it's a rather scripted experience - that is, you'll be facing the same enemy components each time you play a given mission.  Still, battles seldom play out the same, and there's lots of room to make your own variety through tactics and troop selection.  It's also difficult to recommend this title to anyone who was on the fence about Blitzkrieg.  It doesn't offer anything radically different enough to truly seperate it from that title.  Indeed, I think it's pretty fair to say that 'Panzers plays much like the plucky younger brother of Blitzkrieg, expanding on many ideas and refining others.  Basically, if you liked that game you're gonna love this.<br />Armchair generals take note...this title represents a new wave of WW2 strategy, and would be a worthy medal to add to your collection.",Video_Games

So, I gave it s chance. After all, Apted was responsible for ""Always Outnumbered"" and ""The World is Not Enough"" recently and I thought that if he could combine the melancholy of ""Always outnumbered"" with the action of ""The World is not Enough"" we might have a decent film on our hands. Jennifer Lopez also proved she had dramatic acting ability in ""The Cell."" Wow, what a waste of all involved. All of them seem to be slumming it. ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" at least had a more haunting villain and when he just wouldn't die in the film's finale it was ridiculous but heart pounding.

Jennifer Lopez's main concern is protecting her daughter from all of the pain and anguish that her husband has put into their lives.<br />This movie is filled with a lot of suspense and jumps, which reminds me of a similar film, ""Sleeping With the Enemy.""<br />The climactic scene at the end where Jennifer Lopez's character finally gives her husband what he deserves will have you cheering in your seats.

1,B00I4OBXWI,2015-09-02 22:02:34.000,Class Action lawsuit affecting 7.5 million of these Samsung TVs. You need to know that there is a class action lawsuit affecting 7.5 million of these Samsung TV's.  The TV will just go off and cannot be restarted.  Problem is that the capacitors on the power supply board will overheat and fail.  They are rated for 84F.  Replacement capacitors are rated for 103 F.  I suspect Samsung doesn't want to fix the problem with higher temp rated capacitors because more money can be made in selling replacement new power supply boards than in honoring their very limited one year warranty.  Our TV lasted 15 months.  Square Trade is useless and won't respond to our calls or emails.,Unknown

4,B00HMFY426,2016-04-29 04:16:30.000,"Very Helpful Minecraft Starters Guide, very unique landscape seeds. This is a pretty good book for the beginner in minecraft. It is mainly for people who are interested in unique landscapes and building ideas. There are many seeds to choose from and each has a description of the landscape and some important coordinates that you may find interesting such as the location of the dungeon and fortress for some.  The book only has a few pictures so you have to rely on checking out the seed given to see if it is what you are interested in or not. I found this book very simple to read and understand and it does have a lot of helpful information about the various seeds and house building ideas.  I would suggest this to anyone who is looking to explore the various seeds and anyone who is looking for just something out of the ordinary to do while playing minecraft. The only con is that some of the seeds are pretty basic and don't include the locations for everything you might want to find on that seed. Not all descriptions have locations for fortress (if one) or for the villages or temples. In addition there is no info on diamond or dungeon locations so it is pretty much just to get you started and mainly just to give you some really nice landscape features while still allowing you to explore and find all the materials you need. I don't want to give away any of the seeds or actual information in the book but it is helpful information for anyone who loves minecraft.

1,B00006HAWN,2003-01-15 20:00:21.000,"Implausible to its core. Jennifer Lopez, in spite of what her detractors say, is capable of giving a good, skilled performance in a good movie. For those who don't believe me, look at her work in Steven Soderbergh's ""Out of Sight."" It was layered, funny, sexy, intelligent and daring. Since ""Out of Sight,"" though, Lopez has yet to make a movie as good or give a performance as good. Onscreen, even in a weak film, she can be charming, as she was in ""Maid in Manhattan"" or ""The Wedding Planner,"" or better than her script, as she was in ""Angel Eyes"" or ""The Cell.""<br />""Enough,"" though, is her worst performance and worst film. When I saw this in the theater, having read some bad reviews, I found I could only sit through half of it before deciding that I'd wasted enough of my time. It was awful, offensive, scary, implausible and badly written.<br />Lopez stars as Slim, a waitress swept off her feet by Mitch, a rich and charming man who always gets what he wants. Years into their marriage and long after the daughter they've conceived has grown into a precocious, annoying little movie child, Slim finds out just how far Mitch will go to get his way. Suddenly, though she's known him for years and never had a problem with him, his character turns from a prince into a psychotic, abusive monster. This happens in marriages, I know, but I doubt it happens this way.<br />Campbell plays Mitch as a looped, inhuman monster. His character isn't to be believed. Neither is Lopez's. Saddled with an undefined character with an unexplained first name, you never, ever feel anything for her.<br />... I walked out of the movie because it didn't make any sense and I wasn't going to wait around for some violence-splattered, who-cares-anyway ending.",Unknown

If you have this version of the Dot then you know they sound like an old transistor radio - which drives me crazy after listening for more than 5 minutes. The 1Mii Bluetooth speaker upgrade improves Dot's sound-making it loud and clear enough to listen to long-term. The bass and dynamic range is much improved - not to the point of being equal to Echo or Tap, but a huge improvement over the Dot alone. For me, the fact that it has a self-contained battery like Tap is just a bonus - I can't comment on how long it lasts because I don't use them that way. I do think that the voice/music switch on the 1Mii is an unnecessary feature - I leave it set for music to get the best sound output nomatter what I'm listening to on these units.

3,B00006HAWN,2006-10-08 00:15:49.000,"Starts off strong... ... and begins to fizzle toward the end.<br /><br />""Slim"" is a waitress in a diner and falls victim to the conning ways of a charming snake, only to be rescued by a charming snake in sheeps clothing. Well, she ends up marrying the snake who rescues her and has several years worth of blissful ignorance, until she discovers the snake is having an affair. When she confronts him, the once mild mannered husband and father turns into a raving loon. Okay, so we are giving a small glimpse into his character when he threatens the old man to buy his house, but short of that, we have no clue until at least 4 or 5 years down the road that this guy is a real jerk - and abusive to boot.<br /><br />That's the first place where I think the movie kind of takes a bad turn.<br /><br />Next, we watch a lot of implausible scenes where none of the characters do anything that they should in the situation given at the time. While I liked the movie in general, I found myself saying out loud several times, ""Oh, that's just stupid. No one would ever do that!"" or ""What the heck was she thinking? That's not what someoen would really do!""<br /><br />In the end, the last scene, the retribution and redemption scene, is cheesy and WAY over the top. I was disappointed with the ending, and also disappointed that the loose end with Slim's real father was never tied up for us. She left him with, ""Not now, because it wouldn't be sincere, but at some point, when this is over, you need to admit I'm your kid."" (or something like that)... and he never did. (shrug)<br /><br />Noah Wiley, whom I usually like, played a part that I believe was beneath him and I was disappointed with his performance in it as well. Jennifer Lopez, given the role and the story line itself, did a great job with her character, and her daughter in the movie, Gracie, was adorable.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the movie, but to call it a legitimate thriller is pushing it a bit, yet I wouldn't go quite so far as to say it was B grade either. Somewhere between Good and Cheesy, it's worth a night on the couch with a bowl of popcorn, if you have nothing better to do.",Unknown

5,B00J613OHU,2014-04-01 18:48:57.000,"Great series! If you like I Am Legend, 28 Days Later you will enjoy this! This review is for books 1-4 in this series opposed to each individual title, as I ‘listen’ to my books with the text to speech feature on my Kindle Fire, I blazed thru all four of them rather quickly. The first two of which were contained in box sets of multiple other books from other authors. I liked the first one so much I looked for the 2nd, which was part of another box set, so I got it, and book 3 & 4 which were sold together.<br />First, I was really happy to see this story take place in Austin instead of New York, L.A., Boston, or D.C . like so many other stories and shows. I guess I’m rather partial since I’m a Texan and was born not far from Austin and lived there as a child.<br />Second, I applaud Bobby for seeking out people with knowledge on guns or other topics to really add a depth of realism to his writings. As a 2nd amendment supporter and gun owner as well as a SCUBA diver, I really enjoyed the accuracy in which he writes. There are reloads, people run low or out of ammo, not everyone is a Marine Sniper and misses….<br />I liked the characters and I am really eager for the 5th installment which at the time of writing this ‘should’ be available in a matter of months. I could see this story arc continuing on for several more installments and I hope it does, as I have not looked up the author’s intent, but I hope he plans to continue this story for at least a few more books!",Unknown

I love vibe plates for after a work out, after sitting at a desk too long, for a morning body shake up, for a before bed (cause my back is in sooooo much pain) these are magical if you have muscle pain or back pain, heck if you can talk yourself on one of these when your head hurts (non migraine, but sinus type headache) they work wonders for that.  My mom actually ended up with mine (this was a secondary one I had for my convenience on the main floor while cooking my meals) after she tried it out.  She sits in her chair and uses the lowest motion as she has heart issues, but was ok'd for no standing and light use.  SHE LOVES this thing, even from sitting at low motion, it helps her lower back pain and gives her a bit of energy.  It also helps her not feel like she got movement in (some days are harder for her to get up and walk to far, so this makes here feel like she achieved something healthy).  I have another model, but I loved this one for the fact I could sit on a chair, I could sit on the machine and work some other areas, it has more range of motion options to make it a full body movement.

Our main character Zed aka Null Spot has been pulled out of the shadows as a hero and from book one to now book four you can't help but pray that the next book keeps him and his close friends alive in such a devastating environment. Murphy, Steph, Top, and even Russell... with each book their development delves deeper into how attached Zed is at keeping his humanity.

1,B00006HAWN,2015-02-18 04:49:39.000,"Bad acting, bad dialogue, bad casting choices...etc. I'm going to be brief because there aren't enough adjectives in the English language to explain how awful this movie is. So I'll just stick with the facts and leave it at that.<br /><br />This movie is supposed to be about domestic abuse. I thought at first I'd selected the wrong title on Netflix, because despite the plot summary and thriller-esque video cover, this film opened up with all kinds of frills and silliness. The scripty font and lighthearted music in the beginning actually made me think this was a romantic comedy. Then I couldn't decide if it was comedy or some kind of thriller parody flick, because Juliette Lewis is saying to Jennifer Lopez, arguably one of the most beautiful women alive, that she's so plainly she'll never get a date. And Lopez looks put out and mopes around because she seems to take her friend's words to heart and believe they're true. Then some customer at the restaurant she's working at starts hitting on her, only to soon reveal it was all a game to see how fast he could get her in bed, because she's so homely she will sleep with anyone and he thought he could win an easy bet.<br /><br />I'm sorry... Jennifer Lopez, playing a &#34;plain Jane&#34; with no hope for any man really wanting her? They didn't even try to make her look anything other than stunning and glamorous; from the get-go she's got highlights in that gorgeous honey-blond hair, and her makeup is perfection. If that doesn't warn you what a farce this flick is going to turn out to be, there's nothing else I can say that will dissuade you from getting your hopes up. It might have worked if they chose an actress who A.) can act and B.) isn't drop-dead gorgeous, but...well, that was their choice and it just didn't play out the way it was supposedly meant to. Unless this was a parody film. I am really still not even sure.",Unknown

I was hesitant to buy another noise machine off Amazon but I figured I would give this one a chance. I’m so happy I did! This machine was much more money and sooo much better in design, quality, and options. Night light touches by tapping speaker kind of like a touch lamp. It has many color settings and even a multi color setting. The speakers volume capacity is amazing! I promise you the highest setting is too loud so no worries there. Overall very pleased with this buy and would highly recommend. Ps the nature sounds are so cool, it would surely help with seasonal depression in the winter months.

Most of the characters were well-developed and engaging, and the story was well-paced. There were a few characters who baffled me, though, such as Maura (so randomly mentioned that the plot twist involving her reads like an afterthought) and Levi (why did his uncle falsely accuse him?). Regarding the plot, was the real treasure the pin or the household objects? (I want to be clear since a kidnapping was necessary.)<br /><br />The editing was really poor. In one section Lorena became &#34;Laura.&#34; Mr. Taylor's scandalous dress was both a &#34;revolution&#34; and a &#34;revelation.&#34; In the last 25% of the book, random letters were underlined.

Amazing picture for the money and none of the silly &#34;smart&#34; features that are common on more expensive sets but are easily (and better) replicated by using a streaming box/stick for $30.  There will be some glare, but you can negate most of that by mounting it to a wall with a tilting wall mount.  Once you tilt it down a few degrees, you won't even notice the glare anymore.  Any remaining glare is easily forgotten once you see how great the picture is!!  &#34;Movie&#34; picture mode seems to give the best results without having the TV professionally calibrated.

Love that it has a light (not too bright) that I can leave on if I want to find it easily at night. The light illuminates the ring around the top and the various control buttons. It's heavier than I expected too (feels solid and like it's made from quality materials), which is great because it can't be easily knocked off of my night stand by pets. So far I've only used it with the timer (which automatically turns it off after selected time periods), and I think that's great because I don't need white noise to stay asleep, just to help get to sleep.",Unknown

I am normally not a big fan of using anything in baking because I am weary of the chemicals that can be released with heat, etc.  So after seeing these baking mats I spent a lot of time reading about silicone and the effects of heat on it.  Although there is nothing 100% conclusive, (is there ever), the overwhelming majority of experts agree that there is nothing harmful in using silicone mats or spatulas, etc.<br /><br />So with that behind me, I decided to take the plunge and use these mats.  I received the one that has 2 sizes in it.  One is perfect for a cookie sheet and the other is great for smaller cake pans, etc.  I like the way they look and feel.  They've actually put some thought into making it look pleasing which is always a plus.  Also, they don't feel cheap or flimsy even though they are substantially less expensive than other brands.<br /><br />Being a newbie to baking with mats, I was astonished at how much I like baking with them.  It just makes everything so much easier.

5,B00006HAWN,2019-09-25 23:37:03.694,"THIS MOVIE PROVES WOMEN ARE TOUGH!!!  AND VIEWING IT ONCE IS NOT ENOUGH!!! ""ENOUGH"" (2002) This is an exciting and meaningful movie that everyone should see. For women, it's a powerful and highly motivational reminder that even one incident of physical and emotional abuse is NOT acceptable... especially by a spouse who is supposed to be a helpmate, not an abuser. For men, this movie is a vivid object lesson in how NOT to behave. And it visually reinforces the self-destructive result of such abusive behavior.<br /><br />J-Lo stars as Slim, a waitress who marries her hero, Mitch (Billy Campbell). But several years and a daughter later, Slim is devastated to discover that her hero and father of her child is a cheating and abusive zero. She tries to leave, but the misogynist-psycho husband continues to brutalize, and virtually enslaves her.<br /><br />When the police are unable to offer her protection from further abuse, Slim hires a trainer and takes a crash course in basic kickboxing & defensive maneuvers. A breathtaking car chase and Slim's final confrontation with Mitch are alone worth the price of admission. This suspenseful and well-directed thriller by Michael Apted will leave you feeling a new respect for the not-so-weaker sex.<br /><br />J-lo is supported by Juliette Lewis (Cape Fear) as Slim's best friend Ginny, an ex-boyfriend Joe (Dan Futterman); and Slim's philandering estranged father played by the legendary charismatic tough guy Fred Ward (Tremors).<br /><br />TRIVIA: The movie ""Enough"" had a budget of $38 million. And it grossed over $39 million in just the first week, showing in 2623 theaters across the country.",Unknown

When I first the trailer for Enough I thought the film might be a fake Sleeping With The Enemy in retrospec the film is that but Enough is more of a crowd pleasing film than anything. Jennifer Lopez carries the movie as Slim an abused wife who decides to fight back. Lopez gives one of her best performances since The Cell. Micheal Apted shows J-LO's beauty as a sweet innocent waitress, then a loving/battered housewife to a woman who has had Enough . Billy Campbell gives one of the best villians performances of the year as the husband and Noah Wyle is great as a supporting villian. Juillete Lewis, Dan Futtermen and Tessa Allen as Slim's daughter all give good performances also. Don't get me wrong the film is no Oscar picture but it sets out to please a crowd and that what it does. I give it *** out of ****.",Unknown

4,B00J613OHU,2014-06-02 02:36:15.000,"Good Read if you're into possible End Of World Scenarios. I have been reading Bobby Adair's Slow Burn series every time a new book comes out.  The books are fairly cheap, around $2 each.  Basically, the story is a POSSIBLE End Of The World type story.  There is a new infection.  it affects people differently.  Some are immune, others become primitive due to the virus (like caveman primitive).  And then there are the ""slow burns"".  These humans have body temperatures above normal.  The higher the body temperature, the lower your intelligence.  You can tell who has the disease because they have this albino white look.  Since not everyone knows about ""Slow burns"" immune and unaffected humans fear them, thinking they are all primitive and cannibalistic.  Oh yeah, those seriously infected like to feed on non-diseased human flesh.  They are attracted to noise.  However, many slow burns can and do function like normal humans, but can also blend in with the primitive diseased who can no longer do basic things like talk.<br /><br />This series follows Zed's adventures after he wakes up as a slow burn one day, fighting for survival.  He picks up other slow burns and non-diseased humans along the way, and they band together for safety.  All in all, the series is an interesting read if you're into this genre.  I would have wanted to give this series 3.5 stars if possible.  It's frustrating that the author broke the series up into 5 short parts.  One book can be read easily within a few hours.  I feel Adair should've consolidated the books into a trilogy or something.  Each book is less than 200 pages, I believe.  It's like reading the equivalent of a half-hour TV show episode.  Each book doesn't end with a cliffhanger persay, but the main issue has not been resolved. Namely, how is humanity going to survive, continue, co-exist with Slow Burns?  Who will come out on top?  These two questions are what keep me reading the series.  Book 1 is free, so it doesn't hurt to read Book 1 to see if it's your type of book, and then decide if you want to continue.  But you may end up like me - having to read the whole series because the question of what happens to humanity nags at you.",Unknown

5,B001L2SA6M,2011-02-03 21:43:59.000,"Great for tiny babies. Frustrated with other pacifiers, most notably the ""soothie"" type given out by hospitals (the kind that constantly pops out of the mouth), I originally chose the standard Avent pacifiers for my first son because they most resembled the shape of a breast nipple when inside a baby's mouth.  I found they were the best because of the shape, the fact that they are silicone, come in simple colors, have the nifty snap-on cap, and have no up/down.  But when shopping for my newborn, I found this ""freeflow"" type, and I have to say it's so much better than the original!  Firstly, the shield has more ventilation holes.  But more importantly, not only is the shield slightly curved to conform to baby's face, but the outer edge of it is also curved back away from the face (whereas the original is completely flat).  This looks more comfortable for baby, PLUS the curved edge does not cut into a tiny baby's nose like the original.  Highly recommended!! The best out there!",Unknown

I was not interested in 3D (it's quickly losing its luster and what is the point of calibrating your TV to get the perfect picture just to put on tinted 3D glasses?).<br /><br />I have it mounted on our living room wall at eye level. I have twelve 360 lumen (total 4320) recessed lights and do not have any glare problems with all the lights on.<br /><br />Also, no problems with brightness with all the lights on and windows un-shuttered. There is a Cell Light control setting that you can increase along with Brightness adjustment to make the TV as bright as any LED.<br /><br />Black levels are nice and deep. No ""soap opera effect"" or motion blurring because it is a plasma. 45 deg angle viewing from second couch about 9 feet away is excellent.<br /><br />Pentile display concerns are overblown unless you normally sit 2 feet away from your TV in which you do see the pixels.<br /><br />Heavier than an LED at 76lbs but easily wall mounted.<br /><br />Energy usage is an estimated $22 a year based on 11 cents per Khw for 5 hours a day of use.<br /><br />There are only 2 HDMI ports so if you have 3 or more devices then invest in an HDMI switch.  There is a digital optical out port so you can connect that to your stereo system and your HDMI audio will be sent there.<br /><br />My living room is a 266 sq ft rectangle so the TV speakers in surround sound mode is more than adequate for normal viewing. Owners with larger living rooms or cinephiles would probably want more audio power.<br /><br />All in all, a gorgeous display at an amazing value.",Unknown

5,B00E3K927K,2013-08-14 04:19:36.000,A perhaps too believable look ahead. A well thought out plot with a back drop of characters and well described location that had my searching immediately for a large map of Seattle and the surrounding area to follow the described action better.<br /><br />The calamatous situation of a ruthless armed invasion of an unprepared United States and the disruption of her infrastructure feels all too real but the resilience and training off the main characters argues well for the developing story in the next novel.  The characterisation is very good and one feels drawn into their situation and speculating as to their next moves.<br /><br />All in all an excellent and enjoyable pace to the yarn and I look forward to the sequel.,Unknown

Once again, I listened to this book rather than reading, at this point I feel almost as if that is the best way for me to proceed with this series. It seems more fair somehow. I've gotta' say, I think I'm starting to get used to the narrator, or maybe he's gotten better at opposite gender voices. Either way, it's not annoying me as much as it did at the beginning of the series.<br /><br />This installment of the saga finds Zed getting some up close and personal views of the infected and gives him the opportunity to really examine how some of them operate. I'm not sure how this is going to play out in the future, but I definitely want to find out. I now feel completely hooked.<br /><br />Dead Fire had me absolutely livid at one point, and even though I'm a fairly passive person, I'm not sure I would have reacted the way Zed did.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, I'm starting to feel more invested in the story now and have even already bought the next book and it's audible upgrade so I can continue this tale.<br /><br />Overall I give Dead Fire 4 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Reviewed on Just Another Girl and Her Books blog.",Unknown
5,B00006HAWN,2017-12-08 04:21:38.978,"An Excellent, Underrated Film. I think this is a very good film. The script and storyline are excellent and believable. I almost always like films when the underdog wins against all the odds. Jennifer Lopez is perfect in this role. I think she's a very good, underrated actor - I've liked her in every film I've seen her in (especially Selena). In this film, she portrays a woman who is physically and emotionally abused by her husband, an all too often tragic situation that women find themselves in. In this case, she is desperately trying to protect her daughter first and herself second. All the supporting cast members are very good as well. I especially like Tessa Allen who plays Jennifer's young daughter. This was Tessa's first film and she's now twenty-one years old; still doing commercials and acting. Kudos!<br /><br />I've seen this movie many times on TV and I finally ordered it today for my DVD collection.<br /><br />The filmmakers decided to use Aimee Mann's song &#34;Today's the Day&#34; in the film. I bought the song as an mp3 a couple of years ago. The song is modified for the film but the modification is appropriate for the film. The song is not on the soundtrack.

I like that there is a twist to the Zombie EOTWAWKI genre with the slow burn and intelligent zombie character. The stories are all well-constructed and keep the reader engaged. The plot is not predictable as many in the same space seem to be repeating the same story lines over and over. This one is different which I appreciate.<br /><br />I plan on picking up book 5, I just thought I need to write a review. I will use this same review for the first 4 books.<br /><br />There are few grammatical errors, which I am happy to overlook due to the price of the books. Again I feel like I am getting a great value here.<br /><br />As for those who complain about scenarios with guns, tactics, or believable segments may I remind you that you are reading a book about ZOMBIES. Let go of any preconceived notions and flow with the story. The character development has been good and I always fall back on the value for the price paid.<br /><br />Thanks and keep up the great work.",Unknown

Both ends fit fine into multiple devices, and the lights come right on and appear to move in the direction of the charge.  They appear to charge items quickly (not turbo, but not slow).  The blue lights seem to be (in a lit room at least), not too bright or intrusive.  Don’t know if I’d want them next to the bed while trying to sleep, but they don’t seem to light up the area.<br />One thing to bear in mind, the regular USB side (that plugs into the power, not the device), is a little on the thick side, thicker than just a standard USB plug.  While that makes manipulating it a bit easier, it prevents 2 of these from being used right next to each other, which unfortunately is why I bought 2.

4,B08DX7G6CD,2021-10-19 20:12:24.097,"Different sort of thriller. This novel is indeed a psychological thriller. Grace has been treated for mental illness for nearly her whole life, since she began having hallucinations and violent outbursts. Recently, after growing tired of living life in a fog, she has secretly weaned herself off all her psychiatric medications. {Which, by the way, is an extremely dangerous thing to do and something I am sure the author would never encourage. But this is fiction, after all, and so I will stop preaching and finish my review with an apology for the aside} So Grace is feeling much clearer of mind but is she indeed in need of her lifelong pill regimen? This question is what differentiates this book from most other thrillers and what makes it an extremely enjoyable book. I was reminded of some Alfred Hitchcock films and Daphne du Maurier's beautiful and haunting book, Rebecca, which was an Alfred Hitchcock film as well. While I won't say any more about the plot or action so as not to add spoilers, I will say that I thought the first half of the book was wonderful. The second half was still above par but I felt it lost some of the magic of the previous pages. I do recommend it for thriller lovers.<br />Thank you to the publisher for an advance copy.

I suppose I should have kept in mind that Nicholas Kazan, writer of Bicentennial Man wrote the script, both of which were horrible mistakes. Three great actors, Juliette Lewis, Dan Futterman and Bill Cobbs were in this film--a horrible mistake on their part. And while this wasn't the best movie for Noah Wylie to take a part in, he did a wonderful job. He played a villainous role, one that is so unlike what he usually plays, and he did it well.

He adores her and she loves him right back, which complicates her &#34;spinster society&#34; status and causes complications for Ashwick's friends. The secondary characters are just as interesting and there is great material for many sequels. Others have done spoilers.  My only complaint is that the author doesn't tell us how Ashwick, Morris, and Julius handled Mr. Kings, only that they did so. Lorena had hinted that Julius was the dangerous friend and, darn it, I wanted to know why.

A &#34;slow burn&#34; is a quasi zombie who has been infected but not to the point of entire brain loss. The hero is a slow burn who retains enough human qualities and brain capacity to understand what has happened to mankind, and has enough wits that his survival instinct allows him to think beyond just the now.

Since bringing our baby boy home from the hospital, we've tried a variety of pacifiers, to see which ones (if any) he would like; the [[ASIN:B0045I6IAO Philips AVENT Soothie Pacifiers]] were great for the first 2-3 weeks, but after that, they ended up being spat out almost constantly. So we bought these, a generic brand, and a pack of [[ASIN:B00BIFAER0 Dr. Brown's PreVent Design Pacifiers]], and noticed that these were the only pacifiers our son seemed to keep in his mouth.<br /><br />The other brands, he just gnawed on them a bit, then spat them out and started crying. These pacifiers are large enough to not be a choking hazard, but discreet enough that his nose never touches the pacifier. Additionally, cleaning is easy; just run the thing under hot water, or boil them if you need to sanitize.<br /><br />Each pacifier comes with a durable and securely-fitting clear plastic cover.

She went from her father’s house to getting married and having children, always feeling like she is living underwater. She finally has had enough and stops taking her pills. She doesn’t tell anyone, but oddly enough, she doesn’t feel worse, she feels better. Knowing that no one will believe her, she remains silent about her revelation.<br /><br />Could her extremely wealthy father or her husband have something to gain from keeping Grace off balance and compliant? Grace starts to believe that her husband is only with her for her inheritance. Once her elderly father dies, the only thing between him and her money will be Grace, and how hard would it be to kill her and make it look like she harmed herself.<br /><br />Grace comes up with a plan. She will write a fiction book, but it will contain all her suspicions in case something happens to her. She will still be dead, but at least her husband will not get away with murder. Strange things start to happen, and it remains to be seen if Grace is mentally sound or psychotic.<br /><br />A very intriguing story about gaslighting, or the workings of an ill mind. Even though I was rooting for Grace, the alternative was horrifying, I almost hoped she was wrong about those around her.

But, while checking out other reviews, I learned that this series comprises nine books ... which kinda hacked me off because I didn't realize that I was being suckered into a Ponzi-like scheme wherein I had to keep investing more and more money hoping for a payoff (in this case, the payoff hopefully being a happily-after type of ending)!

First let me remind you the dot is not included with the speaker,  I like  my second generation echo dot But with this accessory  it makes me love it the One thing I didn’t like about the dot  it wasn’t quite loud enough for me , But this takes care of that problem the sound quality is very good and quite loud,  it also is a rechargeable battery pack so Once you install your dot  it now makes it portable so you can carry it room to room,  You can also charge your phone from the speaker base .To  Install Just push down on the top while pulling straight up on the cloth body Plug the speaker into the echo dot replace the outer shell and Plug in to charge  and it’s ready to use , you can leave it plugged in all the time or use the battery base to use your Echo Dot as a portable speaker  I love it",Unknown
5,B00J613OHU,2014-04-01 21:38:58.000,"Really fun and different. This book series has been a blast to read. And I'm really only writing this review to criticize all the negative reviewers that stated Mr. Adair is a money hungry author since he's released the books as a series instead of one continuous book. How can a person only be into publishing a book for money when the first book is FREE and all the following have been under $2??? Come on, if you didn't like the plot, the story, the writing style, or what have you, then just say so. Accusing a person of something so radically ridiculous is lost on me. Stephen King (and that's with a ""ph"" not a ""v"" as a few have mistakenly typed) released Green Mile by chapters and it was a well received and rated book series. Keep up the great work, Bobby Adair, and keep your head high for all the rest of the indie authors that have taken a chance! (And no, I have never met, nor have any relation to the author. Figured I'd clarify for the ones accusing only friends and family of writing positive reviews.)",Unknown

2,B00006HAWN,2004-03-22 23:53:25.000,"More Than Enough ... In Fact, Way Too Much. Yet another movie that starts with an intriguing, compelling premise and then veers off-course into insipid melodrama.  Jennifer Lopez stars as a woman who meets an apparent Prince Charming (Billy Campbell); the couple are soon wed and start a family.  Everything appears to be headed towards &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; until Lopez discovers that hubby has a mistress on the side.  When confronted, Campbell peels off his mask and reveals himself to be, in fact, a chauvinistic wife-beater.  Lopez resolves to take their daughter and run ... and it's at this point that the movie breaks down, with Campbell persuing his fleeing wife with all the mechanized determination of The Terminator.  The plot gets steadily cornier, with the down-and-out Lopez luckily getting financial help from her estranged multimillionaire father (wouldn't it be great if all abused wives just happened to have untapped resources like that?), and then receiving the training necessary to - literally - become a female Terminator herself, after which she engages Campbell in a brutal fight-to-the-death.  (I'll let you guess who wins.)<br />The two leads give interesting performances up until the time the script requires their characters to turn cartoonish, and they are given able support by Juliette Lewis as Lopez's best friend.  The wonderful and capable Dan Futterman is pretty much wasted in the thankless role of Lopez's loyal former beau.  The best performance in the film is given by Noah Wyle, playing against type as a hot-tempered renegade bad cop with a very bad case of road rage; it would be interesting to see Wyle play this type of role again, but in a better film.  As satisfying as it might be to see an abusive brute get back better than he dished out, &quot;Enough&quot; is ultimately way too incredible and far-fetched to deliver genuine thrills.",Unknown

4,B01DGW11YC,2016-10-27 09:25:07.000,Hot hot hot. I like this series. A LOT. The problem is the books are too damn short. I mean less than 150 pages? That's barely enough to whet my appetite. It would be nice if there was like an epilogue or something. These books seem to abruptly end right at end of the good parts. No time to come down and savor the hea. Also $5 seems a little pricy for a novella.,Unknown

BUT.... this would be a perfect shirt with the butterflies etc, however there is an awkward white strip of fabric  at the bottom (bringing attention to body parts we try and cover ya know. and making you look wider)<br />It does not appear as white in the photo but in real life it is strange and cheapens the shirt. It is overpriced enough as is and not worth taking it to a Taylor to re-hem etc",Unknown
