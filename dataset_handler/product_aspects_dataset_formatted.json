This book has saved us many times when we were out at restaurants or the doctor.  When we ask him to pick a book he routinely goes to this book.  Highly recommended.",

I ordered two for my classroom and they're extremely popular during independent reading.",

        "review": "Have A 2 Year Old Boy?  Then Buy This Book. I don't know what it is about 2 year old boys, but when they reach that age they become fascinated with machinery.  I've experienced it with all of my nephews, and the latest addition to our family is no different.<br /><br />This is a large-size, full-color, board book - meaning the pages are thick and sturdy.  All it consists of are photographs of real motorized machinery, taken from various angles, with the names of each vehicle shown.  There's a page devoted to types of cars, types of trains, types of boats, types of airplanes, types of construction vehicles, types of farm vehicles and types of emergency/city vehicles.  So it covers all the bases and is full of images to bring joy to a little boy's heart.<br /><br />My nephew reads this book every night with his father.  Then he reads it over with me when I babysit him.  There is just something so adorable seeing a 2 year old seriously pointing out a combine harvester or a dump truck as if it was the most important thing in the world.  Not to mention the fact that it's a good item to use if you want the little one to have some quiet time.  So if you've got a little boy in your family, or one that you need a gift for, I'd give this book two thumbs up.",

Ex: an SUV is not called an SUV, it is a &#34;Family Car&#34; there is only one truck on the first page with mostly cars and classic vehicles. The second and third page have no trucks on them at all. The fourth page is emergency vehicles, the fifth is farm equipment. The sixth is construction heavy equipment, and the last page has big rigs and community vehicles (i.e. mail truck, garbage truck, etc.). Considering the name of the book, I was expecting more trucks. My son loves trucks especially, and I was fairly disappointed when there were only a handful in the entire book. It is a great &#34;first 100 vehicles&#34; book. But not necessarily a great &#34;Truck&#34; book.",

        "review": "Great book for anyone on white to blue level. I think is a good book about basic jiu jitsu, if you don't know anything is great for you. Basically it give you an idea of what you need to learn in every belt level. He give you some examples of how to survive at white level, escapes at blue level, guard at purple belt etc...I was looking for something more advanced but I'm happy with this book because I learned some techniques and escapes that I didn't know and it gave me ideas of how to improve my game. If you have years in jiu jitsu you don't need this book but I highly recommend it to anyone on white and blue level.",

        "review": "great book on BJJ. I like how this book explains the concepts behind techniques and also gives common mistakes for when techniques go wrong. I also like how the book breaks down what you should be focusing on for all belt levels, however this does not mean that you should not start to learn and apply passing the guard techniques until you have mastered everything that comes before it in the book. I would say that the most beneficial section of the book for me so far is the passing the guard section, although I am only a blue belt these techniques that can be found in the brown belt section of the book have really helped me pass more effectively.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book for lower level belts trying to improve their techniques. I am not sure how much a higher level belt would get out of this book but it has definitely helped me on identifying some technical mistakes I make often.",

If you roll in a Gi then you will definitely want this book.  It gives very detailed instruction about all the things you wondered about and your instructor forgot to tell you.<br /><br />I have many BJJ and MMA books and there is one thing that sets this one apart from every other book.  It is the non-submission stuff. I have been saying for years that I want a book that talks about sweeps and escapes.  Finally we have one.  This book is the missing link for BJJ books.  It tells all the stuff that all of the other ones don't.<br /><br />The only bad thing is that it doesn't talk much about no gi.  In all actuality a lot of the stuff is different then the way you would do it if someone were throwing punches at your face.  But then again, it doesn't claim to be a MMA book.  So it is true to it's word.  I just wish it had a nogi section.  If he comes out with any other books I will be the first to buy it.  Best BJJ book out there!!!!",

They certainly succeed. In these troubled and stressful times, we need to return to another period, to music that had the ability to transform and to heal.

        "review": "More Than Enough ... In Fact, Way Too Much. Yet another movie that starts with an intriguing, compelling premise and then veers off-course into insipid melodrama.  Jennifer Lopez stars as a woman who meets an apparent Prince Charming (Billy Campbell); the couple are soon wed and start a family.  Everything appears to be headed towards &quot;Happily Ever After&quot; until Lopez discovers that hubby has a mistress on the side.  When confronted, Campbell peels off his mask and reveals himself to be, in fact, a chauvinistic wife-beater.  Lopez resolves to take their daughter and run ... and it's at this point that the movie breaks down, with Campbell persuing his fleeing wife with all the mechanized determination of The Terminator.  The plot gets steadily cornier, with the down-and-out Lopez luckily getting financial help from her estranged multimillionaire father (wouldn't it be great if all abused wives just happened to have untapped resources like that?), and then receiving the training necessary to - literally - become a female Terminator herself, after which she engages Campbell in a brutal fight-to-the-death.  (I'll let you guess who wins.)<br />The two leads give interesting performances up until the time the script requires their characters to turn cartoonish, and they are given able support by Juliette Lewis as Lopez's best friend.  The wonderful and capable Dan Futterman is pretty much wasted in the thankless role of Lopez's loyal former beau.  The best performance in the film is given by Noah Wyle, playing against type as a hot-tempered renegade bad cop with a very bad case of road rage; it would be interesting to see Wyle play this type of role again, but in a better film.  As satisfying as it might be to see an abusive brute get back better than he dished out, &quot;Enough&quot; is ultimately way too incredible and far-fetched to deliver genuine thrills.",

        "review": "Bad acting, bad dialogue, bad casting choices...etc. I'm going to be brief because there aren't enough adjectives in the English language to explain how awful this movie is. So I'll just stick with the facts and leave it at that.<br /><br />This movie is supposed to be about domestic abuse. I thought at first I'd selected the wrong title on Netflix, because despite the plot summary and thriller-esque video cover, this film opened up with all kinds of frills and silliness. The scripty font and lighthearted music in the beginning actually made me think this was a romantic comedy. Then I couldn't decide if it was comedy or some kind of thriller parody flick, because Juliette Lewis is saying to Jennifer Lopez, arguably one of the most beautiful women alive, that she's so plainly she'll never get a date. And Lopez looks put out and mopes around because she seems to take her friend's words to heart and believe they're true. Then some customer at the restaurant she's working at starts hitting on her, only to soon reveal it was all a game to see how fast he could get her in bed, because she's so homely she will sleep with anyone and he thought he could win an easy bet.<br /><br />I'm sorry... Jennifer Lopez, playing a &#34;plain Jane&#34; with no hope for any man really wanting her? They didn't even try to make her look anything other than stunning and glamorous; from the get-go she's got highlights in that gorgeous honey-blond hair, and her makeup is perfection. If that doesn't warn you what a farce this flick is going to turn out to be, there's nothing else I can say that will dissuade you from getting your hopes up. It might have worked if they chose an actress who A.) can act and B.) isn't drop-dead gorgeous, but...well, that was their choice and it just didn't play out the way it was supposedly meant to. Unless this was a parody film. I am really still not even sure.",

        "review": "An Excellent, Underrated Film. I think this is a very good film. The script and storyline are excellent and believable. I almost always like films when the underdog wins against all the odds. Jennifer Lopez is perfect in this role. I think she's a very good, underrated actor - I've liked her in every film I've seen her in (especially Selena). In this film, she portrays a woman who is physically and emotionally abused by her husband, an all too often tragic situation that women find themselves in. In this case, she is desperately trying to protect her daughter first and herself second. All the supporting cast members are very good as well. I especially like Tessa Allen who plays Jennifer's young daughter. This was Tessa's first film and she's now twenty-one years old; still doing commercials and acting. Kudos!<br /><br />I've seen this movie many times on TV and I finally ordered it today for my DVD collection.<br /><br />The filmmakers decided to use Aimee Mann's song &#34;Today's the Day&#34; in the film. I bought the song as an mp3 a couple of years ago. The song is modified for the film but the modification is appropriate for the film. The song is not on the soundtrack. It's from Aimee Mann's &#34;Lost in Space&#34; album.",

Slim (Jennifer Lopez) falls in love with a charismatic and wealthy contractor named Mitch (Billy Campbell). Things seem to be going well for Slim, they have a nice house, a loving relationship, and a baby girl named Gracie (Tessa Allen), then things go sour. Slim finds out that Mitch has been cheating on her, and decides to address the issue. This does nothing except awaken the abusive beast that has been hidden inside of Mitch. Slim, intolerable of his behavior decides to take Gracie and flee to Michigan. However, little does Slim know that Mitch is an obsessive stalker and her life will never be the same. Tired of living in fear and danger, Slim decides to fight back in what becomes a suspenseful and crowd-pleasing ending.<br /><br />This was a really thrilling film.  I've heard a lot of negative comments about it but I think it was fantastic.",

My parents rented this dvd, and told me it actually was pretty good (though you'd think by now I would have learned my lesson about trusting their judgement on film), so I figured I'd check it out. That was a horrible mistake. Somebody casted Jennifer Lopez as the lead role. That was a horrible mistake. I suppose I should have kept in mind that Nicholas Kazan, writer of Bicentennial Man wrote the script, both of which were horrible mistakes. Three great actors, Juliette Lewis, Dan Futterman and Bill Cobbs were in this film--a horrible mistake on their part. And while this wasn't the best movie for Noah Wylie to take a part in, he did a wonderful job. He played a villainous role, one that is so unlike what he usually plays, and he did it well. Very creepy. Not a horrible mistake to take a role, just a horrible mistake that the role was in this movie. It's predictable and the only outstanding thing about this film is that it is, you guessed it, all a horrible mistake.",

        "review": "Starts off strong... ... and begins to fizzle toward the end.<br /><br />\"Slim\" is a waitress in a diner and falls victim to the conning ways of a charming snake, only to be rescued by a charming snake in sheeps clothing. Well, she ends up marrying the snake who rescues her and has several years worth of blissful ignorance, until she discovers the snake is having an affair. When she confronts him, the once mild mannered husband and father turns into a raving loon. Okay, so we are giving a small glimpse into his character when he threatens the old man to buy his house, but short of that, we have no clue until at least 4 or 5 years down the road that this guy is a real jerk - and abusive to boot.<br /><br />That's the first place where I think the movie kind of takes a bad turn.<br /><br />Next, we watch a lot of implausible scenes where none of the characters do anything that they should in the situation given at the time. While I liked the movie in general, I found myself saying out loud several times, \"Oh, that's just stupid. No one would ever do that!\" or \"What the heck was she thinking? That's not what someoen would really do!\"<br /><br />In the end, the last scene, the retribution and redemption scene, is cheesy and WAY over the top. I was disappointed with the ending, and also disappointed that the loose end with Slim's real father was never tied up for us. She left him with, \"Not now, because it wouldn't be sincere, but at some point, when this is over, you need to admit I'm your kid.\" (or something like that)... and he never did. (shrug)<br /><br />Noah Wiley, whom I usually like, played a part that I believe was beneath him and I was disappointed with his performance in it as well. Jennifer Lopez, given the role and the story line itself, did a great job with her character, and her daughter in the movie, Gracie, was adorable.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed the movie, but to call it a legitimate thriller is pushing it a bit, yet I wouldn't go quite so far as to say it was B grade either. Somewhere between Good and Cheesy, it's worth a night on the couch with a bowl of popcorn, if you have nothing better to do.",

When, despite Slim's efforts to make a new life, Mitch finds her and threatens her again, she puts Gracie in safe keeping, toughens herself mentally and physically and sets out to prove to Mitch she's had enough.

I don't understand why so many critics panned this film starring the ubiquitous Jennifer Lopez, but I rather enjoyed the film.<br />\"Enough\" is a film about a woman who marries what she thinks is the perfect man, but who turns out to be a nightmare. He cheats on her and throws it in her face, and he also is abusive. Jennifer Lopez's main concern is protecting her daughter from all of the pain and anguish that her husband has put into their lives.<br />This movie is filled with a lot of suspense and jumps, which reminds me of a similar film, \"Sleeping With the Enemy.\"<br />The climactic scene at the end where Jennifer Lopez's character finally gives her husband what he deserves will have you cheering in your seats. If nothing else, this film can show people, especially women, that no matter how small or weak you are, you can still protect yourself and the lives of your children from anyone who tries to hurt them.<br />Watch this movie!",

Micheal Apted shows J-LO's beauty as a sweet innocent waitress, then a loving/battered housewife to a woman who has had Enough . Billy Campbell gives one of the best villians performances of the year as the husband and Noah Wyle is great as a supporting villian. Juillete Lewis, Dan Futtermen and Tessa Allen as Slim's daughter all give good performances also.

        "review": "Slumming it. I thought \"Enough\" would be terrible, but then I saw that Michael Apted and Nicholas Kazan were director and writer respectively. So, I gave it s chance. After all, Apted was responsible for \"Always Outnumbered\" and \"The World is Not Enough\" recently and I thought that if he could combine the melancholy of \"Always outnumbered\" with the action of \"The World is not Enough\" we might have a decent film on our hands. Jennifer Lopez also proved she had dramatic acting ability in \"The Cell.\" Wow, what a waste of all involved. All of them seem to be slumming it. \"Sleeping with the Enemy\" at least had a more haunting villain and when he just wouldn't die in the film's finale it was ridiculous but heart pounding. I much preferred its finale to \"Enough's\" in which Lopez becomes a female ninja. Elia Kazan must be spinning in his grave.",

        "review": "What a Waste! I thought I'd be generous & rate it two stars.<br />There are numerous movies that deal with domestic violence.  Many of them are good.  This one is a waste of 2 hours that you'll never get back.  The lines are incredibly asinine - from all the actors, even the small child who plays the couple's daughter.  The storyline is equally silly, especially the final scenes where the wife (played by Jennifer Lopez) breaks into her husband's house & challenges him to a physical fight.  Ms. Lopez would do well to stick to singing; her acting (at least in this project) was as lame as the writing & casting.<br />The title....&#34;Enough,&#34; is appropriate; we've had enough of poorly-done movies.",

She goes from a normal woman to super ninja in less than a month. But with Jennifer behind the wheel everything is forgiven. In my opinion, she is a far greater actress than singer. Her true calling is on film. She's a lot like Sandra Bullock. Even if the movie is terrible the one thing you like is her. I'll go see any Jennifer Lopez movie.",

        "review": "THIS MOVIE PROVES WOMEN ARE TOUGH!!!  AND VIEWING IT ONCE IS NOT ENOUGH!!! \"ENOUGH\" (2002) This is an exciting and meaningful movie that everyone should see. For women, it's a powerful and highly motivational reminder that even one incident of physical and emotional abuse is NOT acceptable... especially by a spouse who is supposed to be a helpmate, not an abuser. For men, this movie is a vivid object lesson in how NOT to behave. And it visually reinforces the self-destructive result of such abusive behavior.<br /><br />J-Lo stars as Slim, a waitress who marries her hero, Mitch (Billy Campbell). But several years and a daughter later, Slim is devastated to discover that her hero and father of her child is a cheating and abusive zero. She tries to leave, but the misogynist-psycho husband continues to brutalize, and virtually enslaves her.<br /><br />When the police are unable to offer her protection from further abuse, Slim hires a trainer and takes a crash course in basic kickboxing & defensive maneuvers. A breathtaking car chase and Slim's final confrontation with Mitch are alone worth the price of admission. This suspenseful and well-directed thriller by Michael Apted will leave you feeling a new respect for the not-so-weaker sex.<br /><br />J-lo is supported by Juliette Lewis (Cape Fear) as Slim's best friend Ginny, an ex-boyfriend Joe (Dan Futterman); and Slim's philandering estranged father played by the legendary charismatic tough guy Fred Ward (Tremors).<br /><br />TRIVIA: The movie \"Enough\" had a budget of $38 million. And it grossed over $39 million in just the first week, showing in 2623 theaters across the country.",

        "review": "Implausible to its core. Jennifer Lopez, in spite of what her detractors say, is capable of giving a good, skilled performance in a good movie. For those who don't believe me, look at her work in Steven Soderbergh's \"Out of Sight.\" It was layered, funny, sexy, intelligent and daring. Since \"Out of Sight,\" though, Lopez has yet to make a movie as good or give a performance as good. Onscreen, even in a weak film, she can be charming, as she was in \"Maid in Manhattan\" or \"The Wedding Planner,\" or better than her script, as she was in \"Angel Eyes\" or \"The Cell.\"<br />\"Enough,\" though, is her worst performance and worst film. When I saw this in the theater, having read some bad reviews, I found I could only sit through half of it before deciding that I'd wasted enough of my time. It was awful, offensive, scary, implausible and badly written.<br />Lopez stars as Slim, a waitress swept off her feet by Mitch, a rich and charming man who always gets what he wants. Years into their marriage and long after the daughter they've conceived has grown into a precocious, annoying little movie child, Slim finds out just how far Mitch will go to get his way. Suddenly, though she's known him for years and never had a problem with him, his character turns from a prince into a psychotic, abusive monster. This happens in marriages, I know, but I doubt it happens this way.<br />Campbell plays Mitch as a looped, inhuman monster. His character isn't to be believed. Neither is Lopez's. Saddled with an undefined character with an unexplained first name, you never, ever feel anything for her.<br />... I walked out of the movie because it didn't make any sense and I wasn't going to wait around for some violence-splattered, who-cares-anyway ending.",
