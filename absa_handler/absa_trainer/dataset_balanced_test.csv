doesn't expand enough to fit around some things,"Helpful Around Home. I'm 5'6""  so I'm not short  but our kitchen cabinets are way out of my reach. I hate having to drag the step stool in just to reach things on the top shelf. This tool is very helpful in those situations. And it's much smaller than the step stool and fits nicely in the pantry. I like that you can rotate the part that grips onto items. I also like that you can extend it at an angel is you want. It works pretty well for most items. I have found that the claw part (for lack of the official term) doesn't expand enough to fit around some things. I was trying to reach the container of salt so I could refill the shaker and it barely fit around that. Other than that  I like it.",0
fit to be a bit on the small side,"Fun Top. This is a cute top for spring or summer. The fabric is very lightweight. The sleeves have a slight flutter that is flattering on the arm. There are functional buttons at the top. If you are a larger cup size  there may be gaps between these buttons. You can easily fix it with either a safety pin or a few stitches. I found the fit to be a bit on the small side. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the large.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",0
scratches easily,Very Disappointed. I have always used Speck cases and this is the first one I have been disappointed with.  It is a little loose so it wiggles around. The buttons are very difficult to push. Scratches very easily. Looked terrible after only a week.,0
Northern European culture,The true China wow.. Tells me as a German-born immigrant to America  how blessed I have been to be raised in a Northern European culture and living in America which was made great by Northern Europeans the great founders of America.  Love my culture. I  wanted to go and visit China  God help me   now I understand why they need the Americans and Europeans to invest in factories. The work like slaves.,1
product leaked considerably,Poor quality. Arrived timely packaged minimally and professionally. After install product leaked considerably. Further eval revealed a poorly finished lid that was rough and burred  this caused the seal around the O-ring to fail.  I discarded the entire thing and bought a replacement from Lowe’s.,0
receiving items that are open,These smell wonderful. These smell wonderful and my clothes had no static cling.  The reason for 4 stars is the box arrived crushed.  It didn't hurt the product  but I don't like receiving items that are open.,0
a little on the short side,Pretty shirt a little on the short side. Really nice shirt. A little thicker material than I thought (polyester)  but the colors are really pretty and virant and it lays off my shoulders nicely. If I had any complaint at all I wish it were longer. I tend to like a t-shirt which comes down almost to cover my butt  this stops at about half way down my stomach. So keep that in mind if you are looking to hide a couple of extra pounds (this isn't the shirt for that).,0
sucks the battery down quite steadily and quickly,works  but drains the battery. I purchased this for use with Kindle Fire while I am in Canada and can't access my streaming any other way... The up side is that it works really well  a bit pricy  but I use it.  The downside is that is sucks the battery down quite steadily and quickly.  I tend to use it when I can keep my Kindle plugged in. If they could work on the battery drain  it would be a five star.,0
articles about hiking trails,Still not very good. I had a subscription to this magazine a few years ago. I let my sub run out because the magazine was not that good. I decided to give it another try and see if this magazine had improved. Nope  still the same old magazine. The gear reviews always seem to review the high end gear that only a small percentage of people can afford.   The articles are usually about hiking trails that are the top tier trails. PCT  AT  CDT  etc. How about some trails that are in different states that do not take MONTHS to finish! Some nice weekend trails would be awesome!! Seems like this magazine has always been biased towards the west coast. You know  there are many  many other trails in the US  across all 50 States!! Not just CA!  So  looks like this sub will be just like the first time I subbed. Going to let it expire. I can find better content on youtube anyways!,1
younger kids may need some help setting it up,Hours of Fun!. This V-Tech Marble Rush Ultimate Set provides hours of fun! Younger kids may need some help setting it up  but many kids will be able to do it on their own. Set up does take a little bit of time  but the pieces fit well together and it's not frustrating. Batteries are required. It comes with batteries for demo purposes  but it's recommended that they are replaced. We've been playing with it for a several days now without any problems on the original batteries. Suggested age for this is 4+. I think there is a wide spread of ages that would enjoy this.,0
wash and wear,Women's Bike Jersey  Short Sleeve  Full Zipper  with Pockets  Pink by Turnhier. 3 pockets on the back of the shirt with a reflective clip. The thin fabric is ideal for keeping cool and cooling off when you stop. Comfortable against my skin. Wash and wear. Fit as expected.  If it falls apart after a dozen washes I will report back.,1
1000/260 lumens flashlight,Feit LED flashlight 1000/260 lumens. I purchased my first Feit flashlight set from Costco and have been looking for more ever since.  I found these.. I purchased the 1000/260 lumens and the 500.  The 1000 is bigger  but I am disappointed at how lightweight it is. The 500 is a mini flashlight.  I had to read a lot of stuff to find out about how to switch from the full on to the less bright/less battery sucking brightness.  You toggle the power button... push once it's bright  press again it's less bright.  The neck pulls back and forth to widen or sharpen the light beam.  It's ok.  But no where near the quality of my first set.  Having said all of that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,0
learn almost nothing about any of the new kids,yuck. I read this on my kindle. The story is nothing like it should have been. No one was how you remember them. Key characters such as Hagrid are barely even mentioned. We learn almost nothing about any of the new kids except Albus. Don't ruin your Harry Potter memories by reading this book.,0
higher quality stuff is more expensive,"Our handles are not round  these work fine.... I think these things would look more form fitting if your handles were round. That may just be my mind playing tricks on me. If our handles were round  I might think these look better on the flat handles. LOL! In any case  they get the job done. But up close  the fabric does not feel premium  it's on the cheap side. But you need to consider what you're spending for 6 pieces. The higher quality stuff is more expensive and does not come with 6 pieces. The term  ""you get what you pay for"" comes to mind. So I'm not going to deduct a star for that. I think this is 5-Stars for the price you're paying.",0
weird taste,No weird taste.. Nice blend of sweet & salty without the chalkiness. Soft chew. It's good!,0
OXO products,French Press works better. I was so excited to use this for cold brew since I love so many OXO products  but this was a disappointment. I’ve been making cold brew in a French press until now  and I have been pleased with the results  but since it requires hands on filtering  I thought this OXO system would simplify the filtering and allow the machine to do most of the work. Wrong. With a French Press  once the coffee has brewed  I can press the coffee and separate most of the grounds from the cold brew. Then I slowly pour it out into a mesh filter lined with a paper filter and wait for it to slowly seep through. I have to change the paper filter half way through before pouring the second half. With this OXO system  you are supposed to be able to flip the switch and the cold brew will drip down in to the glass carafe below. But the grounds kept clogging the filter and then absolutely no liquid could get through. (I will also note that I have a quality conical burr grinder  so the grind should not be an issue.) I had to stand over it for about 15 min scraping the grounds to the side or scooping spoonfuls of grounds out of the brewing container. After 15 minutes of this  we were left with roughly 2/3 of the volume of cold brew we would have gotten from the same recipe in a French press. The reduced volume was partially due to me scooping grounds out of the way and throwing them in the sink  and partially because there was no way to effectively press the liquid out of the grounds. Also the taste was inferior. Again probably because the most concentrated cold brew couldn’t be pressed out of the grounds. Overall the taste was nowhere as good and the process was more cumbersome than a French press. I wish I loved this machine  but on the plus side  it’s one less thing to sit on my counter and take up more space in the fridge.,1
cleanup,Great indoor  relatively smokeless grill  but difficult to clean. I recently sold my house and moved into an apartment where I intend to stay for about three months until my new house is ready. I love to grill in my old house and new house I had And will use a gas grill.  I knew living in a strange place for a few months and being out of my regular routine  I would really miss the healthier meals that I would make. When I saw this Krupp’s grill  I was a little hesitant.  Currently living in an apartment  I didn’t want to have to worry about smoke detectors going off  or anything else that might impact the building on them. From a personal perspective  I was worried that I wouldn’t like the taste of the food given that I’m used to growing on outdoor grills. Boy  but what a mistake I made! This is an absolutely great grill. I found very little smoke and cooking hamburgers  and they tasted great. I even think they cooked more evenly then they would’ve on the grill.  My only complaint  and that’s why am removing one star  is the cleanup. I did line the pan with aluminum foil which did help. However the inside of the grill underneath the heating element. It’s very difficult to clean. With the splashing of grease from the burgers it did take me a while to try to get this clean  and I’m still not sure if it was 100% clean. I probably won’t be using this quite as often as I would have an outside grill  but in a pinch  this is a great grill to use indoors for an apartment or a home.,0
conclusion,real or memorex. You think you know what you're watching is real but are you sure. I felt engaged all the way through. a few times I thought I was figuring it all out. but as this started coming to a conclusion... not so much. the end leaves you thinking I like that...  when you watch it again you know what's coming but I picked up on things I missed earlier. it helped but I still felt in the end a bit off  not sure if it was real or ....  it will be interesting to wait a few years and watch this again and see how it seems. we don't do movie channels  hbo  showtime etc  we pull out our videos and watch them instead.,0
nice variety of healthy options,Disappointed. I have been getting the snack boxes for about a year now. When they first started they had a nice variety of healthy options that were different from usual snack fare. The last four boxes however have been a huge disappointment. I have even gotten the same product three months in a row. And the snacks seem to have degraded from actual healthy options to “health halo” options such as natural potato chips. After having been extremely disappointed for the third month in a row now  I am cancelling my subscription. I wouldn’t even recommend this unless you like getting the same things over and over.,1
difficulty getting the infuser out,Fruity Water. This product looks like it will be perfect for me to prepare in the morning and take with me for use at work.  I have not had the opportunity to use it yet although it is out of the box  washed and ready to go.  There was some slight difficulty get the infuser out as it was placed pretty low in bottle possibly for shipping purposes so it would not break.  It seems to be fine now.  I would recommend this item based on what I know about it at this time.,0
special effects got so much better,American Werewolf DVD. When I First Saw This Movie After It First Came Out  I Was With My Boyfriend We Were Traveling On the Motorcycle Through the Smokey Mountains. After the Movie We Went To One Of the State Parks  But Because It Was Really Late & the Motorcycle Was Kinda Loud. The State Park Personal Had Us Park  & Camp In the Over Flow Camping Area. My Boyfriend Was Freeking Out  the Movie Did Not Set Too Well With Him. Also It Was Really Cool  Because This Movie Was the First Movie To Actually Have A Person Turn Into A Full Werewolf Instead Of A Half Man Half Wolf. But Since Then Special Effects Got Soo Much Better  So Now Since I Have Watched the Movie Again It's Not As Good.,1
river rocks look &quotwet&quot and polished again,Krylon Crystal clear gloss spray.. So... I used this on some sort of polished river rocks in my yard... they just weren't &quotshiny&quot enough.. after a few months in the Arizona sun.  Sooo.. I thought I'd try this.  I was very happy with the results.  The river rocks look &quotwet&quot and polished again.Not fake... very natural gloss - So happy with the results.  I am hoping it lasts longer that the so called &quotpolish&quot that was original to the rocks I mean  I paid extra for the &quotpolished&quot rocks! *sigh*  In the mean time this was very easy to apply.  I got the hose out... rinsed the rocks all off and allowed them to dry.  Used a blower to get rid of extra dust and pine needles (from neighbors pine tree) and sprayed evenly.  Solidly dry in 30 minutes.  Really happy with the results. Even though this probably not the usual application!,1
form fitting,Too small  and the torn areas are all uniform. Not a natural tore look.. Too small and more boxy than form fitting like I thought by looking at the picture of jacket. The torn parts look very fake. The areas all uniform in size and shape and lined up with one another perfectly. I wear 1X bought a 3X and couldn't even button it. This jacket it made from heavy material. After wearing it awhile I thought it would weight you down. All the buttons were buttoned up when I received it and were EXTREAMLY hard to unbutton. Returned,0
bathroom light,Wonderful upcycle. Perfect for my “steampunk” light bathroom. Looks great with the perfect amount of novelty to it. Thanks for the extra tlc,1
perfect gift,Very nice gift. perfect gift or even a grab bag item,1
good tummy control,Runs a Bit Small. These are good leggings for all types of workouts. The fabric is very soft and stretchy. There's good tummy control. The waistband may roll down a bit while doing some exercises. The fit runs a bit small. I sized up for comfort.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1
carrier,LOTS OF ALLERGIES AND BEST Essential Oils I Ever Bought.. I bought this set last June and just opened it now. The fact that the oils are SO fresh upon opening nine months later says a lot.  A few things you have to understand:  The negative review about allergy upon skin contact is only ONE case. As someone with a ton of skin sensitivities and contact dermatitis  I also got a tiny bit itchy with mixing the orange  lemongrass and rosemary onto my skin but THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. These are 100% essential oil  NOT mixed with any kind of carrier. If you go to Whole Foods and buy one of the AuraCacia oils  many are mixed with jojoba oil so that they are easier on skin. Yes  they also have a line of 100% essential oils but these are a much better value. These are FULL POTENCY and VOLATILE which means yes  they *can* burn skin and SHOULD NOT be used on or around pets (do research as I know some oils are poisonous to cats). Any full potency oil can be extremely toxic to children if ingested. If you are making a batch of homemade lotion  DIY sanitizers or whatever else  you add like 4-5 drops for every CUP of product. More than that is going to be way too much. That said  this is actually a REALLY great value for this entire set. And non-GMO  Organic?!!! AMAZING.,0
waist size,Be sure to double check your waist size!. Be very careful to pay attention to details! I thought I was ordering a size 22/24. The 24 was actually a waist size. It was my mistake!!!!! They’re beautiful and I wish I could order in my size. The only reason I gave them 4 stars was to put us larger ladies in notice that the size is in inches.,0
misspelled words,Liked it a lot. Samantha  a nurse is kidnapped by an FBI agent on the run with a young boy. She ends up going on the run with them and helps him to discover who wanted them dead. A lot of suspense  a good plot and decently written. A few misspelled words and bouncing between POV's without warning was confusing. Also  too many scenes were neatly explained away and too many simple daily functions were never included which took away the believability of the story. Aside from that I adored the family dynamic and the happily ever after.,0
fun,Sturdy. I always loved the game of monopoly I knew I would like this Puzzle. For me it was a bit of a challenge... But I did finish it. It was fun . The pc are easy to hold and the puzzle stays together well.,1
tarte au sucre,A delightful tour of the many gastronomic pleasures Quebec has to offer.... Julian Armstrong has written about food for the Montreal Gazette for more than five decades. As soon as I heard about this book  I knew it was the one for me I studied abroad for two summers in a French immersion program at Universite Laval in Quebec City and majored in French with an emphasis on Quebec Studies  so La Belle Province has a huge place in my heart. Quebec is a huge land area with great diversity in its landscape and people some regions are famous for certain products (the nickname “bleuets ” blueberries  is given to people from the Lac-St-Jean area as they grow large amounts of the fruit). Quebec also produces many excellent raw milk cheeses (which are under strict control in other provinces) and maple syrup. Its culinary heritage is strongly influenced by hearty French cuisine preferred by trappers and fur traders. “Made in Quebec” is the author’s second cookbook focusing on the cuisine of Quebec here she spent several years interviewing cheese makers  mushroom foragers  chefs and farmers  salt cod fishermen  fruit scientists and growers. The book is divided by season and include both staples (poutine  tourti&egravere  tarte au sucre  pate chinois) and modern interpretations of traditional flavours. I loved the simple  delicious vegetarian options like the gorgeous Tarte aux tomates confites au sirop d’&eacuterable et cru du clocher (Tomato Tarts with Maple Syrup) on the cover in addition to many lamb and pork dishes  there are many fish- and veggie-based dishes to enjoy. The desserts in particular are spectacular.,1
quality would allow quiet non mechanical sounds...and maybe softer so you could actually snuggle it,battery sleeping kitty. [[VIDEOID:c33aceda60ff5d241b2b5fd1408c94f]] UPDATED REVIEW BELOW...I have to say this little kitten is just simply adorable.  She is silent until you get your ear directly over her... then it sounds like really purring.  She is delightful.  Even my husband thought she was adorable.  I have serious pet allergies and this seemed like a little comfort without the allergic reaction. I am surprised at how realistic it looks and feels.  Now  you won't really want to &#34cuddle&#34 her.... she is a bit stiff  particularly on the bottom.  But you could hold her in your lap and pat her.  She comes with a lovely pet bed  a wooden backed brush and the cardboard box she comes in converts into a pet carrier if you'd like.  There is an adoption form to fill out if you'd like.  She takes 1 D cell battery... and yes  the battery box is screwed down. There is a slight chemically odor when you first open it.. but it dissipates quickly. Didn't notice within a few hours of opening.  I included a video so you can get a better feel for it.  I feel like it was worth every penny!  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful and I never shy away from responding to comments and/or questions. Further  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind.  My purchases are VERIFIED  100% full price  independent purchases.  You can trust that my reviews are 100% independent and are my opinion.  Which may differ from yours.  Happy shopping to all! UPDATE:  8/29/2016..... While I still like my little kitty  she has developed a &#34mechanical sound&#34 while &#34breathing&#34.... too bad.... wishing wishing wishing the quality was better.  When I get annoyed by the sound I have to take the battery out... as others have said  an on and off switch would be preferable than screw down battery case. Just a little disappointed. UPDATE: 10/30/2016.... I have had this little kitty for a couple of months and she is still going - no battery changes yet.  The &#34mechanical sound&#34 sort of comes and goes... My 5 year old grandson is really enamored of her.  He brushes her and coos to her that she is &#34sooo cute.&#34  So.  That's worth it  right?  It is oddly soothing to have it just sitting there... &#34breathing.&#34  I do wish there was an on and off switch and the quality would allow quiet  non mechanical sounds...and maybe softer so you could actually snuggle it.,0
Bigger than we thought,Toy. Bigger then we thought it be but grandkids love it.,1
not even close to commercially available name brand waxy caramels,I love these!. As advertised: Soft  buttery  homemade style caramels.  Not even close to commercially available name brand waxy caramels.  So yummy!,1
sound is very clear,Purchased for Telecommuting. I originally purchased these headphones as I needed something that would connect to both my  computer and my cellphone for attending online meetings at home.  The sound is very clear and I like the ease of adjusting the volume right on the earpiece. But the mic has a delay so it is tough to get the attention of coworkers when you have a point with the delay. I estimate the delay is 2-3 seconds as that is how long the pause is when I get a response back during a call.  They also could be better at noise cancelling but my home is pretty quiet so that isn't a big issue for me. I don't use it for gaming so I did not give that a rating.,1
sustain pedal isn't that great,fancy keyboard. It's not too bad. I'm used to playing on a piano though  so the keyboard is a little tough. It's hard to control sound with these keys compared to what I'm used to. I'll only be using this until I can afford to get my piano shipped to me.  There's more stuff on this keyboard than I'll probably ever use. All different sorts of things you can use like splitting and layering  recording  playing songs so you can play along with them  a million different kinds of instruments. It's pretty crazy.  The headphones are alright. They don't block out noise that's going on around you though at all  which I sort of expected from the look of them.  The power supply cord was damaged when it came  so my husband has written to amazon a week or two ago about it and they just got back to him today. His problem is in the middle of being processed or something  so we'll see if they just send us another or if we have to send it back to them (hopefully not). I've been using a different power cord that we had left over from an internet router box or something like that. The wattage on it said it should be compatible and it hasn't killed it yet. I got this keyboard for Christmas and it would've sucked if I couldn't use it until a few weeks from now whenever Amazon resolves our problem.  The sustain pedal isn't that great. It doesn't sustain very well at all. And it never stays in place. It constantly moves back across the floor as you're trying to press your foot on it. I tried putting no-slip rubbery mat stuff on the bottom of it but it didn't work. Maybe if you have carpet it won't move around on you  but even for that I'm doubtful. I haven't figured out how to anchor it into place yet.,0

perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
cute book,Five Stars. My Granddaughter loves the lift the flap books. This a cute book for her.,1

well made,Great stockpot  perfect for everyone!. This is a great stockpot for the money. First  it is super attractive  well made and lightweight. I love this color  too  it blends with all my kitchen decor. I love Rachel Ray products as they always provide good products at reasonable prices. This 6 quart size is great for making pasta and soups. This would make an excellent bridal shower or housewarming present for anyone. Highly recommend!,1
value for what you get,Great value for what you get!. It's a hit! My first box arrived today. It included two plush catnip toys. A crinkly play mat. A a bag of three furry mice. And lastly a full size bag of treats!,1

offers an alternate clues-only view,"Decent  But Expensive Not Fully Functional on New Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" Tablet. CROSSWORDS by Standalone is a decent crossword puzzle app  but inflexible and expensive.  On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet  the working display shows about two-thirds of a weekday NY Times puzzle grid  and I can't find any way to resize the grid to show the whole puzzle at once. (You must swipe down or hit an arrow button to reveal the lower one-third of the grid.)  The Across and Down clues appear alongside the grid in a readable typeface  but the clues are cut off at the right.  (Perhaps this is an 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD issue that the developer will correct fortunately  clicking on a cut-off clue will display the full clue below the grid.)  The puzzle hints--found under the list icon beside the app icon  at the left--don't always work as expected.  For example  ""reveal entire puzzle"" only filled in one word (for the 1-down clue) when I started from the ""hints for 1-down"" screen.  In contrast  ""reveal entire puzzle"" filled in the entire puzzle when I started from a ""press-and-hold-on-clue"" popup.  Worse  the general settings for navigation (e.g.  ""skip filled squares""  ""show mistakes"") don't seem to function at all.  (Perhaps this is another Kindle Fire HD issue for the developer to fix.)  The app allows you to enter multiple letters in a single square  and to look up puzzle info (must-haves for NY Times crossword solvers).  If you are a NY Times crosswords subscriber  the app will automatically download the daily puzzles for you.  The app comes with an assortment of puzzles already installed  and allows you to browse for and download many more puzzles from the Internet.  It also allows you to establish an account and compare your times with other solvers.  However  the FREE [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] app does nearly all of the same things.  (Crosswords Plus does not download your NY Times subscription puzzles automatically  although it makes it easy to download them daily it doesn't come with puzzles loaded  although it points you to free Internet sources and it doesn't have a feature for comparing scores with other solvers.)  In addition  [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] allows you to resize the grid  offers an alternate clues-only view  includes the usual hints options  and has navigational settings (skipping boxes  etc.) that are fully functional on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet.  Even if this CROSSWORDS app worked perfectly  I would still prefer [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]].  For this reason  and because of the high price and current Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet issues  I rate CROSSWORDS at 3 stars.",0

supper ideas,Quick and easy vegetarian recipes that are heavy on processed products. I became vegetarian during grad school. Living in the dorm  I didn't have direct access to a kitchen  either. This necessitated frequent trips to the local co-op / organic store. Student's Vegetarian Cookbook for Dummies is perfect for this scenario: busy student  not much time (or space) to cook. Many of the included recipes take five or less minutes to throw together.  The first 85 pages or so are dedicated to understanding reasons for a vegetarian diet  living the vegetarian lifestyle  and basic cooking methods and tools. If you have a basic knowledge of cooking  that is more than enough  since most of time these recipes simply involve unwrapping and microwaving. The instructions were so simple that this would be an appropriate book for teens (it's literally things like how to assemble a sandwich or veggie burger). I was also put off by the fact that so many of the ingredients are heavily processed (soy meats  vegetarian gravy  Pasta Roni seasoning packets).  The biggest issue for me was that so little of the included recipes sounded remotely appetizing. There is nutritional info provided many of the suppers relied extensively on potatoes and pasta and had calorie and fat counts that were rather high (600+ calories for the smothered potatoes  538 calories for the Athena's Potatoes  646 calories and 39 g fat for the Blue Cheese Fettuccine). That's not to say that healthier vegetarian options aren't present many of the five-minute lunches have much lower calorie counts and rely on whole grains  veggies  cottage cheese  hummus  and beans  but if you ate the included supper ideas on a regular basis  it could easily pack on the weight.  Overall  this would be a good first book for those who are new to the kitchen the included recipes are so simple that you'll want to move to something a little more challenging  like [[ASIN:0767927478 Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone]] or [[ASIN:0764524836 How to Cook Everything Vegetarian: Simple Meatless Recipes for Great Food]].

not the most powerful tools Dewalt offers,Dewalt Max Lithium-Ion 4 tool set. My husband is a project manager.  Uses Dewalt tools every day and for many  many years.  While this kit is NOT the most powerful tools Dewalt offers  he says that they are perfectly fine for home use.  Further he believes that the tool bag is worth it's weight in gold.  It keeps tools readily available and is handy to use in carrying the tools to your project area.  I have to admit most of the men I've seen looking over the tools are ooing and ahing over the actual tool bag.  We purchased this on &#34Prime Sale Day&#34 and my husband believes that we paid a fair sale price.  While it wasn't a &#34steal&#34 it was well worth the money spent.  Everything listed was included... and interestingly the piece that my husband thought he would not use much has turned out to be the most used at this time - the flashlight!  The tools are fairly heavy pieces so I am not sure I will be used them as a girl (ha) but they are certainly doable.  I always update my reviews if new info would be helpful.  Finally  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.,0
"Susan McKeown and Natalie Merchant on ""River""","5 stars alone for including Brian Kennedy's magnificent ""Carrickfergus""!!. I am an all-out Brian Kennedy fanatic. Brian who  you ask? Brian Kennedy  Belfast-born singer with a voice of spun gold  was Van Morrison's back up singer for several years  recorded the *original* You Raise Me Up (NOT Josh Groban)  starred in hundreds of Riverdance on Broadway shows  and for all of that  he's unheard-of in the US. Celtic Circle 2 includes Brian's soul-wrenching rendition of ""Carrickfergus "" a beautiful song of lament  accompanied only by Brian's less-is-more acoustic guitar. Haunting.  Besides the wonderful gift of Brian Kennedy  Celtic Circle 2 builds on the solid combination of modern Celtic music and Irish-influenced New Age that was so successful on Vol. 1. This time around  we have two discs of the Chieftains (the timeless ""Love Theme from Barry Lyndon"" and ""The Foggy Dew"" with Sinead O'Connor)  Clannad (Caislean Oir  Newgrange  Almost Seems)  Maire Brennan  Irish-American powerhouse Cherish The Ladies  Aine Minogue  Nightnoise  fabulous Irish bagpiper Davy Spillane  James Galway  and the stellar team of Susan McKeown and Natalie Merchant on ""River."" Sarah McLachlan even makes an early appearance with Celtic-inspired ""Drawn To The Rhythm."" My only lament is that Loreena McKennitt wasn't featured Ms. McKennitt's early works were classical Celtic-influenced melodies set to famous poems  accompanied by harp.  It's a much-welcome breath of fresh air to see Celtic and New Age done so well  as BMG has consistently shown on its ""Celtic Circle"" releases. So many ""Celtic"" releases are in fact substandard New Age treacle with anonymous vocals and synth instruments  but here we have 30 outstanding tracks that capture the lyric  melancholy beauty of the Irish nature  recorded by masters of the trade (the Chieftains have been around for more than three decades!). Yes  there are New Age pieces  too  tracks from Lord of the Rings and Titanic  but there is a much more balanced look at modern Celtic on Celtic Circle 2 than on the first (more Celtic  less New Age).  Perfect music for relaxing to at the end of a long day -- light a few candles  close your eyes  and let the soothing Celtic melodies inspire and refresh your weary spirit.",1

HugeBase which includes over 5 million games,"Superb Chess Database and Preparation Software. I am a longtime user of Chess Assistant  having used it since version 6.0. Chess Assistant is at its heart a database program but it is a lot more than just a database manager with a lot of chess games stored in databases - it also is a tournament preparation partner  a playing partner and top-drawer analysis tool. Compared to other commercial chess database applications available  it is a phenomenal value.  There are three editions of Chess Assistant available. The base level package is the Starter package and it is a great place to start when working with this type of application. The Professional package is similar but has additional content and has a more powerful commercial chess-playing ""engine"" included. The Mega package is the top-of-the-line offering and has even more content included. I will focus on the Professional package.  Chess Assistant includes several databases of games. The most notable is the HugeBase which includes over 5 million games. There is a Guru database which includes games from the top chess players in the world. There is also a Correspondence database that includes games between notable correspondence players. All of these databases are searchable via a number of criteria  such as player name  opening system used  date  result and more. Using the search functions  it is very easy to isolate any desired categories of games  such as all games played by a specific player in a range of dates where said player used a specific opening system.  Not all of the databases are collections of games. One database in particular is the Openings database and it is used to study opening systems. This is a powerful and complete database for really getting into the meat of any opening. It ties in with the other databases as well so following a specific line in an opening can show the percentage of wins to losses using any given line.  Where this database system really shows its power is in the functions geared towards preparation for opponents. With a single menu item selection all of the games by a specific player can be pulled from a database with a breakdown of openings used and the success rate of those openings against the player being researched. Professional players will find this to be invaluable - in short order this functionality can quickly expose an opponent's soft spots.  Chess Assistant does a lot more than manage databases of chess games. It includes several chess playing engines that can be used for sparring. And  because of built-in support for WinBoard and UCI protocols  adding other engines is easy to so that almost all of the available chess engines for download on the Internet can be linked in and used for playing  either against a human opponent or against each other.  Engines that are linked in can be used for analyzing games as well.  Once a game is in one of the databases  there are functions for performing game analysis that provide a quick and complete automatic analysis of said game with minimal interaction from the user. Analysis can be based on the amount of time the engine is allowed to use or the depth to which the engine should search (depth being in ""ply""  or half-moves). Analyzed games are automatically annotated by the engine and additional annotations can be made by the user.  The Professional package includes Houdini 3 Pro  currently the strongest chess playing engine available in the world. (The Starter package includes Houdini 3  not Houdini 3 Pro). Houdini is powerful enough that it will cruch all opponents (including the world champion) with ease so it is not the best choice for a sparring partner unless you want to expose weaknesses in your game with clinical precision. Where Houdini shows its value is actually in game analysis  where it can find even the most subtle advantages and explain where errors occurred that other engines cannot see.  Another nice feature included in Chess Assistant is an interface to the Internet Chess Club (ICC)  where one can watch games  play and interact with other players. There is limited guest access  so be aware than not all functions are available to non-subscribers.  Chess Assistant's user interface has remained relatively unchanged over the several years I have been using it and its the one criticism I have of the application. Though many functions are grouped appropriately  there are a few cases where finding a specific setting requires a but of hunting through menu selections and dialog boxes. Also  I dislike some of the default settings as well  one example being that engines are given only a small amount of memory for hash tables which limits their strength. These are nitpicks and can be worked around but are worth mention.  Chess Assistant is a powerful and fairly complete chess application  combining database functionality with the ability to link in chess playing/analysis engines. It is the one chess application I use consistently and in my opinion is worth every penny. If you need a chess database application  Chess Assistant is probably the best value available.",1
Canadian pastime hockey,"Another fine example of Canadian humor...that you'll never see in the US. I first read about Bon Cop  Bad Cop while riding the train to Montreal. There was a bilingual featurette on the film in VIA Rail's magazine  and I was instantly intrigued. I'd seen Colm Feore at Stratford four years ago  and I was familiar with Patrick Huard from the Les Boys hockey film franchise. I studied at Laval University in Quebec City for two months  and specialized in Quebec Studies (history  literature  and cinema) as an undergraduate  so I was intrigued to see how the film would balance both the bilingual and bicultural aspects of living in Canada. The issue of Quebec is a contentious one for a number of political  social  and cultural reasons. Bon Cop  Bad Cop attempts to use humor in an attempt to defuse volatile issues between the Two Solitudes (English- and French-speaking Canada).  A series of brutal murders in the Canadian hockey community pairs together two very different cops: Torontonian Martin Ward  (Colm Feore) a by-the-book  prim-and-proper intellectual  and rough-and-tumble David Bouchard  a shoot first  ask later detective from Montreal. Naturally  the two despise each other at first sight  and the rapid-fire bilingual one-liners between Martin and David are fast and furious from the get-go. Some critics panned the film for a seemingly forced  unnatural balance of bilingual script  but as someone who's trilingual  I frequently switch languages when speaking to other bilingual friends nothing unnatural there.  Much of the comedic humor comes from the culture clash between Martin and David  Ontario and Quebec there are numerous in-jokes regarding Canadian law  stereotypes of Quebeckers (diehard smokers  dangerous drivers  womanizers) and Torontonians (cold  boring  workaholics) and nods to popular Canadian culture (Rick Mercer of This Hour has 22 Minutes does a great Don Cherry impression  Uniprix commercial spoof  cameo by Nanette Workman). There are some hilarious scenes involving tortured translation between the Quebec police chief and his Ontarian counterpart as the two (fully bilingual) detectives watch in disbelief. The secondary characters really shine  from a speed-talking coroner to Martin's glamorous  hip sister who's hot for David  as does the bilingual script. The special effects are very well done considering that the film had an $8 million budget.  In the vein of earlier Canadian comedies like [[ASIN:B00006FDCT Strange Brew]]and [[ASIN:B00006IUG0 Men With Brooms]](a curling ""comedy"" from Paul Gross aka Constable Benton Frasier of [[ASIN:B000A0GY0K Due South: Season One (4-DVD Digipack)]])  Bon Cop  Bad Cop is a sendup of that great Canadian pastime  hockey. Of course  beer  curling  beavers  and the fleur de lis make prerequisite appearances  as does marijuana (there is a priceless scene involving a self-destructing marijuana greenhouse that brought to mind the British comedy [[ASIN:B00003CXMY Saving Grace]]). Romantic interest? Check. (You'll never think of ""Vive le Quebec libre!"" quite the same way again...) Action? Car chases? Explosions? Check. The weakest part of the film is the villain  who is never really developed we never know  or care  why he turned psychotic. There is also a gratuitous amount of violence and swearing (nearly all in French) that seemed over-the-top  but it's obvious from the start that this is a film that has no intentions of taking itself seriously.  Looking at these elements separately  Bon Cop  Bad Cop would appear to be another shallow attempt at creating a uniquely ""Canadian"" comedy. But there is an unexpected depth and tenderness in the character development between Martin  David and their respective families (both men are divorced single parents)  and the bilingual dialogue really shines. Huard and Feore give standout performances  and I felt right at home in that strange limbo between Quebec and Ontario from my experiences in both English- and French-speaking Canada. This is a gem that deserves to be seen!",1

My wife has thick hair and other hair clips are just not large or strong enough to hold all of her hair. These however are large enough and strong enough to hold all of her hair back.  You get a nice variety of 12 different colors and they come in a pretty purple box. They work great for clipping back all of the hair  or in small sections as well when straightening.,1
container looks like it is missing a portion,dense mask  smells good  great ingredients my tin is dented/no protective seal. My tin is dented.  It just arrived in a warehouse mailing bag. There was no protective tape  tamper sticker  or cover  or product box... so I am not sure what this product has been through before arriving to me. Ew. I know products are sold by weight not volume  but the container really does look like it is missing a portion  as it is half empty. It is probably all there. The container looks to be a 2 ounce capacity  with 1.7 ounces of product. The product is dense  so after settling  I imagine this is accurate. But still.. between the dented can and the lack of protective seal  I am reticent to use in on my face  and definitely won't be buying it as a gift (which I was considering as I ordered this for me  and figured if i liked it then I would buy it as part of a pampering gift).  Too bad because the container otherwise is attractive  the product smells good  and the ingredients are interesting highly nourishing & repairing for the skin. I love self care products  and doing an occasional mask is relaxing.  1.7 ounces has 3.4 tablespoons. Probably use half a table spoon to cover face. So maybe 7-8 full face applications? I guess price it out like a sheet mask. $3.75 per treatment if assuming 8 applications. More or less depending on how much you use.  I hope the company considers adding a seal or tamper sticker.,0
exquisite,"A must-have CD for an outstanding price. I first read about Daniel Taylor on the SchollSociety messageboards and Amazon.com and I was intrigued. A Canadian countertenor with a voice comparable to Andreas Scholl's? ...I couldn't resist. I took it along on a three-hour bus ride to Tadoussac  Québec.  As the mournful opening strains of Erbarme Dich commenced  the haunting  sweeping violins and viol carried me along the winding roads through the mountains. The sky was overcast  and as I heard Taylor's voice for the first time the sun came out. I was in Heaven beautiful vistas of mountains on one side  jagged cliffs plunging into the St. Laurent on the other and Daniel Taylor's voice in my ears. Erbarme Dich is deep  passionate  and so achingly beautiful. I am an avid lover of Bach but it was the first time I had heard anything from St. Matthew's Passion. I was more familiar with many of the other Dowland songs: Time Stands Still  Come Again  Flow My Tears  and I Saw My Lady Weep  all of which are present on Andreas Scholl's ""English Folksongs and Lute Songs.""  Daniel Taylor's voice is exquisite. Haunting. Ethereal. A creamy  lush  pure sound  more feminine than Scholl's tone  reminiscent of brilliant Japanese countertenor Yoshikazu Mera. As with Scholl  the effect sounds effortless and angelic. ""Daniel Taylor: Portrait"" is an excellent introduction to an amazing talent. Ten stars.",1

extremely pricey,Nice supplement but on the pricey side. On the plus side  I rarely eat breakfast in the morning and I easily can take one of these with no adverse stomach or heartburn side effects. In reading the ingredients  these appear to be chock full of almost everything my 60 year old body needs to be healthy and feel energetic. I have been taking them now for two weeks and I honestly do not feel different  but I am sure it is too soon to tell. On the negative side (hence the deduction of one star)  this is almost $50 for a little over 3 week supply. I find this extremely pricey and not something that I will continue taking once I have completed the bottle (unless I have a miraculous awakening that I do not feel currently). Thinking that Centrum Silver or One a Day for Women can fill most of this for a far more reasonable price.,0
larger cup size,"Ring the Alarm!!!. Someone should call the cops because looking this good should be a crime. This jumpsuit is oh-so-glam! I honestly can't believe how great it looks for the price. The fabric is a lightweight chiffon-like fabric with a hint of stretch. As a woman with rippled thighs  I was concerned about the combination of a light color and a thin fabric. No worries!! There's no show-through even though the pants are unlined. If you're a larger cup size  you'll probably need to wear a tube top or bandeau under this for more coverage. I'm not judging if you want to show off your goodies. The belt is long enough to wrap around twice. I did this for extra cinching. The color I chose is more of a sage green than a true mint. Pay close attention to the size chart. I found it to be very accurate. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the X-Large.

I decided to order another one hoping it was just a fluke (because  as I mentioned  I really like the product) but after another couple of months of use  the batteries won’t charge and I have 2 charging cords. I love the product but am leery of paying another $25 if it’s only going to last a couple of months.

responds to voice commands,Super projecting lights for all party uses! Amazingly good!. This is a super cool product. I live in a new 'cool' 55 and older community in the Daytona Beach area and we have parties at neighbor homes several times a week. When I first set these up I wasn't sure what to expect. But after seeing the  variety of lights  patterns and speeds I knew this would be a hit. We had a Motown party last weekend and this projector was the highlight of the night! Great colors  great remote control capability and even responds to voice commands. This would be a great addition to any home (young or old) for use when there is a party to be had. I definitely highly recommend this gadget for all ages and holidays!,1
rich clear voice,Transports You Away to a Caribbean Island. This is my first Bertie Higgins album  so I can't compare it to his others.  Until this album I only knew him from his mega-hit Key Largo.  It's a great song  but played so much on the radio that I almost got sick of it.  Unfortunately not many of his other songs got as much radio play and that's a shame.  Bertie has a rich clear voice and lot of great songs that transport you away to the islands or to south Florida.  Comparisons to Jimmy Buffet are probably inevitable  since they both seem to sing about layed-back liesure or island living.  Jimmy's fans are known as parrotheads and Bertie's are boneheads.  You might think he copied Buffet and just changed a few things.  Perhaps he did to some extent (Buffet was one of his inspirations)  but I think that Higgins is a much better singer than Buffet  as much as I like Jimmy Buffet.  Sure  the pirate theme seems something contrived and gimmicky and perhaps gets a little silly at times  but it doesn't detract from the fine quality of the songs.  There are a lot of songs here it's a good collection of Bertie's best  I think.  One of the traps that a themed based singer can fall into is having all his songs sound alike.  Each of Bertie's songs sound different.  He also doesn't have one those voices where every song sounds the same  which you find more so with Buffet and various other singers.  There is enough variety in his delivery and the sound of his voice to make this interesting and enjoyable not the same song over and over again.  The themes of most of the songs may be the same  but the variety is still there and that's quite a difficult thing to achieve.,1

I read EVERY article,"Ahhhh ... my favorite magazine. I'm not an archaeologist. If I was born redundantly wealthy I think that I might have been one.  Archaeology is my ""stop everything and read it on the day it arrives"" magazine. I've been a subscriber for years. I read EVERY article. As a reader of archaeology and paleontology tomes  this magazine is the adjunct to my selections of books to read. My wife and I have planned vacations around Archaeology's articles.  I've detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites.  During a cross country moving event 7 years ago  I let the subscription expire for lack of new address. Someone from Archaeology  not a telemarketer for sure  called me and said that I had been such a long term customer that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew ... was it something about the magazine quality? The voice on the other end was just so dang disappointed as she pleaded for feedback that it was stunning enough for me to remember 7 years later. The magazine must be read by a small but dedicated subscriber base and I think the magazine staff themselves makes the calls.  My only complaint is that it only prints every 2 months. If archaeology is among your interests  you would entertain your fancies with a subscription.",1
keyboard is a little tough,fancy keyboard. It's not too bad. I'm used to playing on a piano though  so the keyboard is a little tough. It's hard to control sound with these keys compared to what I'm used to. I'll only be using this until I can afford to get my piano shipped to me.  There's more stuff on this keyboard than I'll probably ever use. All different sorts of things you can use like splitting and layering  recording  playing songs so you can play along with them  a million different kinds of instruments. It's pretty crazy.  The headphones are alright. They don't block out noise that's going on around you though at all  which I sort of expected from the look of them.  The power supply cord was damaged when it came  so my husband has written to amazon a week or two ago about it and they just got back to him today. His problem is in the middle of being processed or something  so we'll see if they just send us another or if we have to send it back to them (hopefully not). I've been using a different power cord that we had left over from an internet router box or something like that. The wattage on it said it should be compatible and it hasn't killed it yet. I got this keyboard for Christmas and it would've sucked if I couldn't use it until a few weeks from now whenever Amazon resolves our problem.  The sustain pedal isn't that great. It doesn't sustain very well at all. And it never stays in place. It constantly moves back across the floor as you're trying to press your foot on it. I tried putting no-slip rubbery mat stuff on the bottom of it but it didn't work. Maybe if you have carpet it won't move around on you  but even for that I'm doubtful. I haven't figured out how to anchor it into place yet.,0

Very comfortable,Great sound! Very comfortable. I'm watching Charlie and the Chocolate factory on my MacBook Air with these headphones.  The sound is awesome!  I haven't tried the mic yet.  They block out outside sounds very well.  If the Neon Red wouldn't look so much like HOT PINK  my husband would wear them when mowing the lawn.  The mic and speaker control are on the left.  These headphones are also very comfortable. They fit my small head as well as my husband's bigger head.  The actual speaker section moves within the frame of the headset so that they lay better on the side of your head.  As someone else said  be careful which color you choose because Neon Red is not red.,1
fan is absolutely useless,Easy to assemble  Bike rides smooth  display and fan not so good.. It is a little difficult to slide the seat into place but I think it's only because it's new. The display panel is too small and it's difficult to see it due to no back lighting. The fan is absolutely useless. Even when I lean into the fan  it doesn't blow my hair at all.  It's too high on the display and too weak.  The plug for the display is in the front of the bike  making it a trip hazard unless you want to face the wall while working out.  I had to tape mine to the bottom of the bike.  They should have passed the wire through the frame of the bike so that it could plug into the back.  The bike itself rides smoothly and is very quiet.  It would be nice to have the bells and whistles actually work correctly.,0

perfect guide to demystify the process,"A handy  well-designed collection of both baking classics and new favorites. I have about 50 baking books ranging the gamut from heritage recipes like [[ASIN:1579125883 Heirloom Baking with the Brass Sisters: More than 100 Years of Recipes Discovered from Family Cookbooks  Original Journals  Scraps of Paper  and Grandmother's Kitchen]] to regional baking of Italy  France  Turkey  and Mexico. When I saw the Taste of Home Baking book  I jumped at the chance to review it.  The recipes come in a sturdy three-ring binder with a removable plastic splashguard. I loved the idea of the splashguard  although I would have liked to see a notes section at the back. The inside covers contain a handy list of food equivalents and ingredient substitutions  and the primer on baking basics is illustrated with numerous color photos.  Index:  Cookies Cakes Bars Cupcakes Cheesecakes Pies and tarts Desserts Quick Breads Muffins  Biscuits  and Scones Yeast Breads Yeast Rolls Coffee Cakes and Sweet Rolls Almost Homemade Trimmed-Down Favorites Holiday Classics  Each recipe has a short comment or introduction by its author  along with the author's name and hometown. The recipe ingredients are printed in an easy-to-read bold font  and steps are clearly numbered. There is no nutritional info provided.  You'll find plenty of familiar favorites here  along with some new and intriguing combinations. For years  our family made snowballs  a nut-and-butter cookie with a hidden Hershey's Kiss in the center. I found an instant new favorite in the chocolate macadamia meltaways a similar idea  except that you make chocolate-and-macadamia centers  chill them  then wrap the macadamia butter dough around them and bake.  For those who have always wanted to try working with yeast  but found it intimidating  this is the perfect guide to demystify the process. There are several chapters on yeast breads  yeast rolls  and sweet rolls  and each chapter opens with a sidebar containing helpful hints. There is a whole page of color photos with step-by-step illustrations of kneading  shaping  and baking yeast bread  tips and troubleshooting for baking in bread machines  how to shape bagels  pretzels  cloverleaf rolls  and more.  If you're in a time crunch  the ""Almost Homemade"" chapter uses box mixes with personalized touches to create quick (and giftable) creations. The ""Trimmed Down"" chapter includes low-fat  egg-free  gluten-free and lactose-free recipes. Holiday recipes features kid-friendly favorites  mostly decorated sugar cookies (boneyard cookies  shamrock cookies  shortbread ornament cookies  etc.).  This is a great go-to baking reference that covers all major baking categories with step-by-step guidance and plenty of photos. It would make a great gift for new bakers (or college students)  since most ingredients are easy to find and there are many simplified recipes that require little time and few ingredients. To sweeten the deal  the book also comes with a free one-year subscription to [[ASIN:B004GVZUU4 Taste of Home (1-year auto-renewal)]].",1
business card size picture of the puzzle,Animal Crossing Vibe. This cat island puzzle has an Animal Crossing vibe to it. The image is fun and colorful  plus it has lots of cats! The pieces are a good size and cut well. I didn't notice any puzzle dust. I did not care for the company logo being on the back of every piece. That actually made it a little more difficult to sort because you had to look at both sides to make sure you were putting the right side up. It doesn't come with a poster of the image either. I really appreciate that addition to puzzles. It's a pain to have to hold the box in your hand just so you can see where things go. The full image is on the bottom of the box. The lid has a blown up picture that doesn't show everything. Plus  the brand logo is on both of the images. They really are pushing their logo on us!! They do include a business card size picture of the puzzle but that's really impossible to use because it's so small.,0
gets cold in the winter,gutter stops. These are cute.. however... they don't really work like the photo shows... unless you have a a torrent of water flowing out of your gutters! Haha.. but they are a cuter end to the gutter than just the end of the gutter pipe.  The back of the gnome is rather large... and a bit awkward to fit exactly.  It more like 'rests' on the bottom of the pipe.  I had to reinforce it with some rocks I had because my pipe didn't come all the way down to the ground.  All in all  it is cute and the water does sort of dribble out  the way it does out of your drain pipe  out of the mouth of the giant frog.  I purchased two of them for pipes that are visible in the front of the house.  They arrived quickly and well packed.  They are molded plastic like material - so no rust. Will last a fairly long time considering you don't throw them around or step on them.  I live right on the Oregon coast front - so it gets cold in the winter - we'll see how they do.,1
multiple listens are required to do Darren's creative vision justice,"Darren truly comes into his own as a solo artist on TDTWM. Darren Hayes  former multiplatinum-selling frontman for Aussie duo Savage Garden ([[ASIN:B000BUXUUG Truly  Madly  Completely- The Best of Savage Garden]])  has come into his own on This Delicate Thing We've Made. It's been a whirlwind few years for Hayes: on his third solo album after [[ASIN:B0000630UH Spin]] (2002) and [[ASIN:B0002QCBE0 The Tension And The Spark]] (2005)  Darren parted ways with Sony  started his own label Powdered Sugar  and married his partner Richard Cullen in a civil ceremony in London.  As one review rightly pointed out  if Hayes was still attached to Sony / Columbia  no megaconglomerate record company would have ever financed anything as ambitious and hard to categorize as This Delicate Thing We've Made. Spanning 25 tracks on 2 CDs  the album is all over the place sonically in a tribute to some of Darren's idols  including Prince  Michael Jackson  and Kate Bush  and the authentic retro vibe is courtesy of a 1983 Fairlight CMI syth. Darren's earlier collaborations with Robert Conley on Spin (Crush (1980 Me) and Tension and the Spark continue on TDTWM  along with Justin Shave as producer (Justin played keyboards on Darren's Big Night In tour).  Even though there is a unifying theme of time travel  Darren's bouncing off the sonic walls  from funk to electro to boy band to uniquely Darren. Unexpected samples (barking dogs  airplanes  horses) crop up in the middle of songs  and two songs (Conversations with God and Neverland) strongly remind me of Tori Amos-influenced Casey Stratton ([[ASIN:B00016XO56 Standing at the Edge]])  who shares the same soaring falsetto and sense of lyrical drama.  My main issue is the balance between uptempo flirtations with electronica (club hit Step Into the Light  Casey  Listen All You People  Me  Myself  and I) and slower ballads  which make up most of the second disc. I feel that TDTWM lacks the overall cohesiveness of Tension and the Spark  and I find myself skipping over a few of the tracks (the aforementioned Bombs Up In My Face and the dark  gritty Setting Sun). However  TDTWM grows on me with each successive listen. It's such a nuanced  complex work that multiple listens are required to do Darren's creative vision justice. As with previous releases  there are several B-sides available exclusively  on the TDTWM singles [[ASIN:B000SFYGXY On the Verge of Something Wonderful]]  [[ASIN:B000SFZ05M On the Verge of Something Wonderful  Vol. 2]]  and [[ASIN:B000SN3VNM On the Verge of Something Wonderful]]: Step Into the Light remixes  Fallen Angel  and I Just Want You To Love Me  as well as a ""bootleg"" digital single available on Darren's official website (www dot darrenhayes.dloadshop.com/shop.asp?arid=2 ) that features God Is In The Room and Ocean.  Kudos to Darren for the creative  pass-the-good-karma origami bird marketing that ties in with TDTWM's theme. He encourages fans to print an origami bird  write a wish or note (world peace  happiness  someone loves you  etc.)  fold it  and leave it in a public place for others to find. If you find a bird  you can upload its location and a photo to neonbird dot com/something-wonderful",0
Beautiful colors,Beautiful colors. I Can't have enough bird feeders. This 1 is very nice With a good weight so it doesn't blow around on a windy day.All the birds love it.,1
don’t work with any of them,Very small.. I was looking forward to receiving these brackets.  But  they are too small to use.  I do not have a broad face  big nose  chin  or big head.  These do not cover my nose and chin at the same time.  They are more for a child’s face.  It’s too much of a bother to send them back so I’ll be giving them to my son for the grandchildren. I have 3 different cloth masks and they don’t work with any of them.  They move around  possibly because they’re so small.  Also  being silicon  I expected them to be at least a bit softer but they are hard.  Very disappointed.,0
Bertie's fans,Transports You Away to a Caribbean Island. This is my first Bertie Higgins album  so I can't compare it to his others.  Until this album I only knew him from his mega-hit Key Largo.  It's a great song  but played so much on the radio that I almost got sick of it.  Unfortunately not many of his other songs got as much radio play and that's a shame.  Bertie has a rich clear voice and lot of great songs that transport you away to the islands or to south Florida.  Comparisons to Jimmy Buffet are probably inevitable  since they both seem to sing about layed-back liesure or island living.  Jimmy's fans are known as parrotheads and Bertie's are boneheads.  You might think he copied Buffet and just changed a few things.  Perhaps he did to some extent (Buffet was one of his inspirations)  but I think that Higgins is a much better singer than Buffet  as much as I like Jimmy Buffet.  Sure  the pirate theme seems something contrived and gimmicky and perhaps gets a little silly at times  but it doesn't detract from the fine quality of the songs.  There are a lot of songs here it's a good collection of Bertie's best  I think.  One of the traps that a themed based singer can fall into is having all his songs sound alike.  Each of Bertie's songs sound different.  He also doesn't have one those voices where every song sounds the same  which you find more so with Buffet and various other singers.  There is enough variety in his delivery and the sound of his voice to make this interesting and enjoyable not the same song over and over again.  The themes of most of the songs may be the same  but the variety is still there and that's quite a difficult thing to achieve.,1
large enough to be noticed but not heavy or cumbersome on the ears,Great earrings for every day! A must have for all women!. For the price  these earrings are a great deal. Perfect size  well made and very attractive  I have been wearing them almost every day since I have received them. These are perfect for dress wear or for casual times  large enough to be noticed but not heavy or cumbersome on the ears. I love the sparkle. Highly recommend these for every woman to keep a pair in her wardrobe!,1
doesn't seem to be doing the trick,Smells good but doesn’t prevent/treat redness.. Smells so good but doesn’t seem to help prevent or treat diaper rash/redness. We have been using it for a few days now  trying to give it a chance but it doesn’t seem to be doing the trick.,0
should have ordered the larger ones,Really like these. So why 4 stars?  I read the review  measured it out and decided for the large instead of the next larger choice  because I really have some thick hair.  They are so pretty  and they even gave me an extra stick. I love using them however I can't use them as I did when I was younger (yes in the 70's).  I can't get the barrette around my hair - I have to use a band first - which defeats both it being pretty and it's use to begin with.  I can attach it  but not around 'all' of my hair.  So I should have ordered the larger ones  because I was trying to omit the band altogether as they give my headaches which is why I used them back in the day.  So I eventually cut my hair length and now use these just to tack the front hair back.  If you have really thick hair  buy the larger size!,0
slight intentional grit adds scrubbing action,"Aromatic bars of ""Soap Shields"" that gently scrub & cleanse. These small bars of soap smell really good and perform well in terms of cleansing and not leaving skin feeling stripped. I like that they are made in USA  handmade in Ohio. These are not fancy soaps. They are small  but they are not necessarily travel sized. They just have a good size and shape that fits perfectly into the hand. That stood out to me on first use. I really like how well it fits in my hand. The bars are tear dropped or pear shaped. More specifically  it is shaped to be a like a defense shield. Get it?  As this is meant to be a bit of an immune defense/support item.  The bars are thin  but not fragile. I can palm it and easily rub it all over without it falling out of my hand. I have been using one bar on and off for a couple of weeks now  and it isn't just disappearing. There are six loose bars in a resealable bag.  The soap has a slight intentional grit to it . This adds some scrubbing action. Creates a nice lather and rinses well. The scent is an intriguing mix of essential oils. Clove  Cinnamon  Oregano  Peppermint  Parsley  Eucalyptus and Rosemary essential oils Not overpowering. Really quite nice.  It has been an odd  but unexpectedly pleasant product to use. The price is budget friendly. I find nothing bad about them or my experience so far. I may consider them again when I run out. I really think they are worth the try.  ""CLEAN INGREDIENTS - Our formula just 8 simple ingredients. Free from harsh chemicals that damage your skin like Sulfates  phthalates  parabens  or synthetic fragrances.

ruin your Harry Potter memories,yuck. I read this on my kindle. The story is nothing like it should have been. No one was how you remember them. Key characters such as Hagrid are barely even mentioned. We learn almost nothing about any of the new kids except Albus. Don't ruin your Harry Potter memories by reading this book.,0
easy to store on book shelf,Very useful for keeping important papers.. Wish it was not so expensive. Very sturdy. Keeps my papers safe. Easy to store on book shelf.,1
not going to provide the protection,Fits perfectly. Bright and colorful. Purchased as a gift and it fit recipient's A11 like a glove. Its not going to provide the protection that some of the more serious  higher priced cases do  but something is better than nothing.,0
electronic metronomes,Solid instrument that can help with not only time  but dynamics and listening skills. I received this as a free review sample. Since there are a number of very detailed reviews I am going to stick to how I use it as a drummer.  First  if you are practicing dynamics  this is an excellent tool. Of course it's designed to develop a sense of time  but it produces a beat in the 60 dB range at one meter. For a drummer this is somewhere in the P to PP range  so if you combine time keeping exercises with dynamics  this is an invaluable tool that I suspect most drummers will overlook because it's based on a design that is literally hundreds of years old. Trust me  this is effective. Moreover  since it is not incredibly loud it reinforces listening skills. I used this for a solid week in my practice room before writing this review and can make the claim that if you are a trained drummer this metronome has the potential to improve your dynamics  listening and time.  A nice thing is this is not as delicate as the old style metronomes upon which the design is based. It's not a toy and does need to be treated with care  but I owned a much older instrument that was temperamental and did not like being moved or handled much. This one is more robust.  Bottom line: if you are uncertain if this will be loud enough  download a copy of [[ASIN:B0054KJND6 Decibel-O-Meter Free]] and measure your own instrument's sound pressure level at one meter and determine if this metronome will be loud enough. For some instruments it may not be  but for many like an acoustic piano  guitar  etc. it will be. For folks like me this works for certain exercises like those I mentioned and it is a lot more pleasant than some of the electronic metronomes I have tried.,0
learning curve,Reverted Again to Simple-Minded Movie Editing Software. Someday  someone will invent easy-to-use  intuitive software for movie editing.  This PINNACLE STUDIO 20 PLUS software is NOT that product.  Because I make movies only for products reviewed on Amazon  I lack the time and motivation to overcome the relatively steep learning curve required for using this full-featured software to good effect.  Once again  I have reverted to using the simplistic Microsoft Movie Maker software for compiling slideshows and editing short movies to accompany reviews.  It's plenty good enough for my purposes  especially given how much the Amazon photo and movie processing takes away from my submitted high-quality photo and movie files.,0
a bit off,real or memorex. You think you know what you're watching is real but are you sure. I felt engaged all the way through. a few times I thought I was figuring it all out. but as this started coming to a conclusion... not so much. the end leaves you thinking I like that...  when you watch it again you know what's coming but I picked up on things I missed earlier. it helped but I still felt in the end a bit off  not sure if it was real or ....  it will be interesting to wait a few years and watch this again and see how it seems. we don't do movie channels  hbo  showtime etc  we pull out our videos and watch them instead.,0
good price,a little small  but good price.. it sticks really well and is cute  just wish it stuck out more for my fingers to hold it a little easier.,1
expensive side,we love the magazine. even though it is a little bit more on the expensive side  the magazin is great information and even my wife picks it up and reads it. Our family really loves it a lot,0
sore throat,Contains a poisonous toxic chemical formaldehyde. I am highly allergic to formaldehyde   it cause me to be dizzy. Have headaches   watering eyes. Sore throat. I had all these things after using this hair condition one time. I read the remarks  and another person asked Amazon if there was formaldehyde in it  and they referred this person to the manufacturer. Located in Hong Kong   they gave the person the run around on the answer. And never did admit it. It is illegal to put it into anything here in the US. I was exposed to it through 2 different sets of sheets and one face cream. And now this hair conditioner. Ive contacted the manufacturer   but I doubt I'll hear from them!!,0
durability,its fun and this price here was great. We use this spinner on game day and remove it until the next week or next game. If you intend on leaving it out for any extended period of time  it will not last. But as long as its taken care of  its fun and this price here was great. I paid $40.00 for this same spinner a few years ago in a local sports shop.,0
6 foot length does not really cover 6 feet,Four Stars. The 6 foot length does not really cover 6 feet.  It's not as attractive as I expected.,0
teeth bend and break in my pocket,Not as good as before. OK at best.  The teeth bend and break in my pocket.  That never happened with previous Ace combs.  They're making them cheaper.,0
pleats allow me to expand this,Feels and works exactly like every other disposable mask I tried. These 3-ply masks look  feel  and work like every other disposable blue mask I have tried. There is wire along the nose area so that I can mold this to my face. The pleats allow me to expand this until it is relatively snug under my chin and along the sides. The ear elastics fit nicely over my ears. Overall  these are comfortable for me.  Buying this brand or any other brand all comes down to the price. The current price of $6.64 ($6.99 minus 5%) is extremely reasonable for 50 masks.,1
Better than expected,Amazing Product. High quality. Very high quality product.  Quick delivery.  Better than expected,1

"requires a space to drain the ""wash water""","Rinses dishes....lovely . could have saved  more than  the exorbitant price PLUS the pai. Not worth the price.  Takes up too much space  putting water in for the wash cycle is difficult AND requires a space to drain the ""wash water"" into unless willing to hook it up to your kitchen sink  which is NOT Worth the effort.  Haul out a bucket of dirty dish water (kills weeds?)",0

wheat flour,fresh and soft. These are subtle licorice pieces. There are pieces that are predominately coconut. I like them.  My bag arrived with a distant &#34use by date&#34 and was soft and fresh. For me  I am so happy to read the ingredient list.  No red dye #40 or yellow #5 or 6.  Here is the ingredient list on the bag: Sugar  cane molasses  wheat flour  glucose syrup (contains sulphites)  desiccated coconut  palm oil  beef gelatin  corn starch  glycerol  natural colors (plain caramel  beetroot red  curcumin  paprika). fat reduced cocoa  licorice exctract  natural flavorings (aniseed  lemon  raspberry  vanilla  orange) glazing agent (beeswax) fruit and vegetable juices for coloring. Allergy alert: equipment shared with products that include peanuts  tree nuts  milk  egg  soy and wheat. NOT a health food.  But a delightful treat without harmful dyes still legal in the USA.,1
handle with extreme care,Super oily and extremely sharp be careful.. At first I really didn't like how oily they were stacked together. I literally sliced my thumb open on the first one I was trying to take off the pile. I sliced my thumb again as I was trying to wipe the oily residue off before loading the rotary cutter. So use and clean with a lot of care. I was on a time crunch to complete a project and didn't have the time for the accidents my first attempt caused me. 😂  However  as long as you are careful and use cautious care they were a great buy for a little price. I will purchase these again when I finish using all that came in the pack.  I did ask a quilter friend that regularly uses her cuter and wheels why they needed to be so gross with oil. I was told that it has to do with how many come in the stack and to keep them very sharp while being tossed about during the moving  handling  and shipping. I don't know if her answer is the reason or not but it did make sense to me.  Just handle with extreme care always. Do not let young children use a rotary cutter. And don't let teens that can barely cut with scissors use either. (I'm not being funny with the teen part they will hurt themselves.) Take my word for it. I had teens helping with the project. Only responsible people should use these extremely helpful tool! This was the best tool (along with the self healing mat) I was ever gifted!,0
Pokemon fans will enjoy it,My son's fav Christmas gift. My teenaged son loves this game. It was his fav Christmas gift. Any Pokemon fans will enjoy it.,1
inaccurately described,Don't bother. Bypass this option for an American company version. It was very disappointing  inaccurately described  and no full refund on returns.,0
help the new couple,So Easy  perfect gift. What an easy way to shop and help the new couple. Loved it.,1
great job of cleaning and treating my windshield,Five stars. These towelette are smaller than the original towelettes.  However  they do a great job of cleaning and treating my windshield.,1
melancholic,Different. I'm a bit disappointed with this one. Every other Florence + the Machine album is an instant 10 in my book. This one  although not bad by any means  just doesn't quite do it for me. A little melancholic. A little too ho-hum. A little too ballad-y. Again  I LOVE FLORENCE...just not this Florence.,0
good enough,Doesnt last long.. Decent but not good enough to take home to meet your parents,0
apply easily,Great way for the little ones to get in the Easter spirit!. These are super cute Easter window decorations. I had my two young grandsons over a couple of weeks ago and the three of us had a lot of fun decorating my window and door glass with these. They apply easily and just as easily they come off (which makes it a great way for my grandsons to change their designs easily. And  when the holiday was over  I easily removed them from my windows. This is a great  inexpensive way to decorate your home. Highly recommend!,1
process of shipping was too hard,It wasn't worth it !!. Well it was worth a shot ! But I gotta pass cause as you can see from beginning to end the last photo its not looking good   my plant arrived in bad shape and the driver left the box upside down ( no way to tell which end was up ) after getting it planted I was hoping it would make it 😬but its dieing 😭slowly its going the process of shipping was just to hard for it so I wont be continuing my Subscription 😞 2 leafs left barely hanging on !! I really think the care given to the plant during shipping was crap ! Maybe a brighter box like orange or red with a warning or fragile ! For shippers to take notice idk but the box was just thrown around like all the rest ! The box was dented   you could see it was not handled well ! So try the service if you want but thats my story 🙏🌿🌱🌵🍀🙏,0
some scary parts,Disney's cartoon Beauty and the Beast. This movie is my big  burly husband's favorite Disney movie for whatever reason.  We watch it and at the end he says  lets watch it again... sigh.  It's a sweet story with a typical life lesson involved.  The animation is top notch and the music is astonishing.  If you aren't singing along and dancing at the best parts  you might be dead.  There are some scary parts in a few places (in case you have really little ones) but mostly it's a movie for all ages - I still can't get over Robby Benson as the voice of the beast.  You listen and see if you can hear it..  so NOT obvious.  He had such a soft  gentle voice - not in this film! We purchase all our movies via stream any more so we don't have to store DVDs.  You can load on most any device and/or stream where ever you have wifi access.  Easy peasy.,0

Seams on top of shoe irritation to big toe,Dont fit!. Seams on top of shoe irritation to big toe.,0
useful for slipping an umbrella inside,A lovely leather tote!. This tote by Pascado is nice. It is rugged and well made. There are shoulder straps (two sizes). The leather is an orangey-brown  which will match most outfits. The inside of the bag is lined. There are two front pockets (magnetic closures) and a rear zippered one. There are also two side pockets which are useful if you want to slip an umbrella inside. The size of the tote is decent and can hold a variety of items (essentials and a small electronic). *The electronics I would consider are a small iPad mini or Kindle. Either would fit fine. The front or side pockets can hold a small cell phone or keys. I have a OnePlus cell phone that fits fine. And finally  I love that this company always encloses a nice “thank you letter ” which is a great touch! I’d recommend this tote.,1
short turns,Awesome little jeep. Awesome little jeep.  It is a nice quality build.  Pretty easy to put together.  Fits a toddler great!  Easy to maneuver  except for those short turns  haha!  It holds up to 50 lbs so it can last a smaller child for years.  I could have ridden in this until I was in 6th grade  but I was a tiny child. Lots of fun and brings lots of excitement to see their very own brightly colored  pink jeep!  Be sure you have it fully charged before giving it to the child  because they will want to ride it all day!,0
material is so thin,Cheap cheap cheap cheap material. This does not look as full and vibrant as the picture! This is poorly constructed and entirely not flattering to anybody type! The material is so thin that you can see right through it and the feel of it just makes you break out in a rash just by looking at it before you even put it on. This is grotesque and if you cannot pronounce the name of the company you should not buy!,0
scent is great,Great scent  very useful in the bathroom.. I generally recycle plastic grocery bags for when trash needs to be thrown out immediately (ie: cleaning out the fridge  changing the cat litter  etc). But these bags are perfect for lining my bathroom garbages  as they are in there for a week or so and help with odor. In fact  the fragrance on these is nice and light  very fresh  and it adds a nice  subtle touch to the bathroom. I also appreciate the flaps that have managed to keep the bag in place  while also making it more convenient to tie up and take out when it's time.,1
Good delivery,Good delivery. Ok for the kids,1
well made,Great winter beanie. Great winter beanie to keep your head warm.  Well made  looks like it will last.,1
Fits 100% perfect,I have not tested the shock yet.. Fits 100% perfect. Look original.,1
molded plastic like material - so no rust,gutter stops. These are cute.. however... they don't really work like the photo shows... unless you have a a torrent of water flowing out of your gutters! Haha.. but they are a cuter end to the gutter than just the end of the gutter pipe.  The back of the gnome is rather large... and a bit awkward to fit exactly.  It more like 'rests' on the bottom of the pipe.  I had to reinforce it with some rocks I had because my pipe didn't come all the way down to the ground.  All in all  it is cute and the water does sort of dribble out  the way it does out of your drain pipe  out of the mouth of the giant frog.  I purchased two of them for pipes that are visible in the front of the house.  They arrived quickly and well packed.  They are molded plastic like material - so no rust. Will last a fairly long time considering you don't throw them around or step on them.  I live right on the Oregon coast front - so it gets cold in the winter - we'll see how they do.,1
believing in yourself,"A moving modern-day NZ fable.. Niki Caro's ""Whale Rider"" (based on the novel by Witi Ihimaera) is an uplifting tale of tradition and inner strength. Twelve-year-old Pai (talented newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes) lives with her grandparents in a rural New Zealand town. Pai's mother and twin brother died in childbirth  and her artist father took off for Europe  where he now has a new (pregnant) girlfriend. Pai's brother was supposed to be the next chief of her tribe  and with his death Pai's grandfather Koro searches for a new (male) leader  failing to see that it is Pai that possesses the courage and talents of a chieftain. The movie is filled with a haunting soundtrack by Dead Can Dance's Lisa Gerrard  including samples of traditional Maori music by Hirini Melbourne. The cinematography beautifully captures the many moods of light and shadow on mountains and sea  as well as stock footage of majestic whales. ""Whale Rider"" is an uplifting tale of love  loss  and courage  about tradition in the face of change  and believing in yourself.",1
absorbs sweat,Great set of dish washing gloves!. This gloves are perfect for dish washing or other household cleaning duties. They keep your hands protect nicely during all these duties we love so dearly  not. They are a good quality product that should stand up the test of time quite nicely  only time will tell. These gloves come with a cotton flocking that makes wearing them nice and comfortable and absorbs your sweat to some degree. Getting a pair of these for $10 is very good so I can recommend purchasing these for sure!,1
articles,Too religious. I wanted to enjoy literary essays  stories  and articles  but it seems like every issue I received this last year is packed full of a religious agenda of one variety or another.  To be sure  the themes seem to be an eclectic variety of spiritual and cultural mysticism  but the magazine never just leaves it out.  It's always a tome espousing some collection of beliefs  cultural systems  and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence using religious narratives  symbols  and sacred histories or allusions from one or another.  Everytime I read it  I feel like I'm being proselytized.,0
cordless vacuum cleaner,"It really ""sucks"". What a wonderful cordless vacuum cleaner.  Love the two power settings.  Easy to use. Order for office because we had carpet only on stairs. It worked so well that I bought one for my husband for his boat and our cars.",1
soggy,Perfect length and size. Just as described.. Love this! Just the right size for my bathtub and just what I needed to keep the water in but not have my curtain all soggy and sticking to the bottom of the tub  really perfect! I was hesitant to buy at first but after using for a while this is myfavourite shower curtain for my bath tub yet. It'd probably be too much to hope in the future it had some sort of design on it but I really love it :)  * Wish the shower curtain rings were better quality though.,0
family complexities abound,surprisingly good- but not a cheerful read. I was reading this for a book club- and enjoyed it much more than I thought I would! It included historical details from nursing during the war  and character development over a couple decades...  family complexities abound. Not a happy read however...,0
arrived dented,wooden bird play tray. Comes completely flat. All pieces are wood.  There are two tiny metal cups for food and water.  There is a bag of screws and allen/phillips end screwdriver.  It was relatively easy to put together.  HOWEVER there are NO directions at all.  Zero Zip Nadda.  You get to come back to the ad page and TRY to follow the tiny printed direction (even after enlarging by hovering over the diagram).  The pieces you are working with are NOT marked even though the diagram suggests they may be.  Is really just an ok set - but I am still really disappointed that they could not manage to provide truly adequate instructions WITH the set.  The metal tray is REALLY thin... just the other side of aluminum foil - seriously.  And it arrived dented in multiple places.  Eh.,0

sauces,A gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!. When I think of Malaysian dishes  it’s the spicy  layered flavors of Norman Musa’s “Amazing Malaysian” that I think of. It opens with street food and snacks  and moves on to seafood  meat  vegetables  rice and noodles  pudding and drinks  and the Malaysian pantry. Gorgeous photos of street scenes in Malaysia pepper the pages  while the gold-embossed cover looks great sitting out on a table or countertop.  You'll find street snack favorites like chicken satay  net pancakes  roti canai  and fried spring rolls  along with Indian lentil patties  grilled fish paste in banana leaf  tofu stuffed with crunchy vegetables  and the gorgeous Kak Besah’s curry puffs. The seafood dishes reminded me of many preparations I had last year while working in Taiwan whole fish steamed with lemongrass  ginger and chilies  squid stir fry  and scrambled eggs with oysters. The meat dishes featured are mostly chicken and beef (no pork unlike Ping’s book)  with lamb curry  beef rendang  and numerous chicken dishes.  One of my new favorite recipes is the Nyonya Vermicelli Noodle Salad  which features rice noodles  tofu beansprouts  and ginger with plenty of lime juice and fresh herbs (if you are vegetarian  leave out the shrimp paste and prawns). I also loved the Malay Vegetable Dhal Curry  pumpkin in turmeric and coconut milk  and eggs in chili sambal (think shakshuka).  Rice and noodle dishes include tomato rice (nasi tomato)  wok-fried flat noodles  curry laksa  chicken rice  herbal rice  and several egg-fried rices in addition to fried noodles. Desserts range from the effortless (fresh mango  honey and coconut  tropical fruit salad) to the more elaborate (pandan custard and sticky rice layered sweet  sticky rice balls  soy panna cotta with passion fruit and crushed chocolate cookies. And you’ll find any number of refreshing drinks  from lemongrass and honey tea and rose syrup drink to pulled sweet tea and iced fresh lime juice.  At the end are several staple condiments  from the ubiquitous chili paste and ginger soy sauce  to sambals (chili  coconut)  sauces  and vegetable pickles.  Norman Musa’s recipes tend to be a bit more advanced but also result in more complex  nuanced flavors. This is a gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!,1
overpriced,Yikes. What you see is definitely not what you get.. Terrible  Low Quality material. Would have returned it but I already washed it. Material is much thinner than it appears in photo and would probably only keep you warm if you sat in a sauna. The photo material looks like a thick polyester material you would HOPE is inner lined with fleece. Keep dreaming.  The outer material is actually a cheap cotton tee shirt-like material with an abrasive texture on inside that mimics sweats but not quite.  After two washings  the hood ties are already fraying apart at the knotted ends and have almost completely faded  even while using Cheer color guard. They definitely overpriced this product for the quality you receive. Don't bother.,0
strength of the light,Great desk lamp with built in charger for your phone. I have been using this as a desk lamp for the past few weeks and I really like it. First  I love the bendable arm so I can adjust the light to wear I need it. Second  I can also adjust the strength of the light to fit the time of day I am using it. I love the added benefit to have a built in wireless charging station for my cell phone so I can keep it in my office without having to plug it in. This lamp is also super modern as well. I really can't speak to the light therapy aspect of this lamp since I don't think the limited sun in the winter really impacts me  but I can say it does light up my desk and does a great job. Highly recommend.,1
secure packaging,"Was great...not so much now.. UPDATE November  2019: I think it's time to put my money into a different subscription. Each month  there are fewer and fewer full and ""deluxe sample"" size products. Those that are full size aren't worth much money. There's no point of me putting my money into so many samples.  OVERVIEW: I just received my first Cocotique box. I was a little nervous  as I'm new to subscription boxes  but I'm actually quite satisfied with the products. Most of them are full-size  and others are large enough to get quite a few uses out of. The month's box (the actual cardboard box the products are in) is absolutely beautiful! Included is a card with extensive information about all of the products  including prices and where to find them should you decide to purchase them. I absolutely love that they included this because I can easily find the products if I want to order them  and I can see the value of the products versus the cost of the box ($25/month).  PRODUCTS: With that being said  the value of the products in the box is well worth the cost of the subscription (in this box  at least). The price of the products come up to about double the cost of the box (approximately $47). So  I'm happy with the value. You get more than 2 or 3 items  and they're pretty large.  CUSTOMER SERVICE CONTACT: One item (eyeshadow) was broken (still sealed). I emailed them on a Saturday and they responded within 2 or 3 hours to apologize and let me know that a replacement was on the way. I greatly appreciate the quick and polite customer service.  SHIPPING: Shipping was EXTRA fast  but...things are not safely secured in the box. I'm not sure if this is how the eyeshadow box was broken or not  but the products definitely need to be better secured. The products are packaged with pretty crinkled paper  but not enough to hold the products in place. Some products are heavier than others  which may cause some issues in some boxes. This is reason for the 4-star review. All of the products were strewn throughout the box in an unorganized way. Unfortunately  mail carriers don't (and sometimes can't) always take the time to ensure that things aren't thrown around during shipping  so more secure packaging may make things a little better.  BILLING: I have to be honest and say that the way they do their billing is a bit...odd to me. They bill on your anniversary date  even if the box isn't due to be shipped for weeks. I signed up in early to mid-March  and I just received my first box  the April box. This  of course  depends when you sign up  but when you initially sign up determines if you receive your first box for the CURRENT month or the month after. I was just now charged for next month's box  even though I just received this month's (April) box today. Again  I'm fairly new to subscription boxes and the other ones that I'm subscribed to charge on your anniversary and send your box when you're charged. YES  this is stated in multiple places on Cocotique's website and other places  so I was aware of it  but again  it's just a bit odd to me because it seems like you're waiting for a very long time for something you've paid for. But  that's the way they work and I'll more than happily deal with it to see what they have in store.  BOTTOM LINE: I will be continuing my subscription. I'm fairly new to the makeup world  so being able to try a wide variety of products (again  these products are large  so you can do a lot more than ""try"" them) without having to buy all of them one-by-one comes in handy. It saves both money and time. I've definitely told my friends about this subscription box  and I'm excited to see what will be in future boxes. I think I'll be ordering some of the past boxes  also.  As time goes by and I receive more boxes  I'll update my review.",0
moisturizing cream,What a great gift set this is!. This is a really nice gift box. Contains everything you need to create your own spa day at home. I have used all the products and I do like them. Great  light  floral fragrance. The moisturizing cream in particular was my favorite followed by the shower gel (which made my skin smooth  clean and feeling so fresh). This would make a great teacher's gift or Mother's Day present. The box and presentation make it for perfect gift giving. Highly recommend!,1
ethereal,"A must-have CD for an outstanding price. I first read about Daniel Taylor on the SchollSociety messageboards and Amazon.com and I was intrigued. A Canadian countertenor with a voice comparable to Andreas Scholl's? ...I couldn't resist. I took it along on a three-hour bus ride to Tadoussac  Québec.  As the mournful opening strains of Erbarme Dich commenced  the haunting  sweeping violins and viol carried me along the winding roads through the mountains. The sky was overcast  and as I heard Taylor's voice for the first time the sun came out. I was in Heaven beautiful vistas of mountains on one side  jagged cliffs plunging into the St. Laurent on the other and Daniel Taylor's voice in my ears. Erbarme Dich is deep  passionate  and so achingly beautiful. I am an avid lover of Bach but it was the first time I had heard anything from St. Matthew's Passion. I was more familiar with many of the other Dowland songs: Time Stands Still  Come Again  Flow My Tears  and I Saw My Lady Weep  all of which are present on Andreas Scholl's ""English Folksongs and Lute Songs.""  Daniel Taylor's voice is exquisite. Haunting. Ethereal. A creamy  lush  pure sound  more feminine than Scholl's tone  reminiscent of brilliant Japanese countertenor Yoshikazu Mera. As with Scholl  the effect sounds effortless and angelic. ""Daniel Taylor: Portrait"" is an excellent introduction to an amazing talent. Ten stars.",1
lost during shipping,Nice  but don't expect a snow globe!. Was disappointed when I had to reorder it because it got lost then itcame(the 1st one) so I had to send it back. Was also disappointed because I thought it was a real snow globe. Should have read up on it. My fault.,0
cute end to the gutter,gutter stops. These are cute.. however... they don't really work like the photo shows... unless you have a a torrent of water flowing out of your gutters! Haha.. but they are a cuter end to the gutter than just the end of the gutter pipe.  The back of the gnome is rather large... and a bit awkward to fit exactly.  It more like 'rests' on the bottom of the pipe.  I had to reinforce it with some rocks I had because my pipe didn't come all the way down to the ground.  All in all  it is cute and the water does sort of dribble out  the way it does out of your drain pipe  out of the mouth of the giant frog.  I purchased two of them for pipes that are visible in the front of the house.  They arrived quickly and well packed.  They are molded plastic like material - so no rust. Will last a fairly long time considering you don't throw them around or step on them.  I live right on the Oregon coast front - so it gets cold in the winter - we'll see how they do.,1
they make beautiful wedding decor or other party decor,mason jar lights. These are just the lids and lights... NO JARS.  I knew this going in  so I purchased my own jars and some polished rocks to use as weights - we have rambunctious ground squirrels.  I also purchased  separately  &#34stainless steel&#34 handles as we live on the ocean front in Oregon.  The handles were a bit of trick to get on the jar - it works best if you &#34screw&#34 them on  like a lid sort of.  I sort of twirled the lights so they hung down as a swirl down the center of the jar and then screwed the lids onto the jars.  They charge in the day  come on at dusk and mostly stay on all night long.  A couple I notice don't.. but I was only hoping for a few hours - so I'm good with this.  They are not really bright enough to use a path way light - but they are bright enough to be a very pretty decoration.  I ordered a dozen  but went back for a third set as my very determined squirrels did manage to shatter one by knocking it off even with rocks for weights!  My Mom loved them  so I let her take three of them.  She has them in her window sill  inside.  They work nicely there too.  As long as they get sun to charge  it's good.  Now  I will say  that the rings have become to rust.  I haven't tried to pop out the light portion and put a new ring on  but I may try this after the summer season is over.  All work.  I had NO failures.  Some don't last through the night  even though they have exactly the same sun exposure - but still  last for hours.  I do recommend putting something in the jars for weights even if you don't have sassy squirrels like we do as they will likely stay put better.  ..As I said I used polished rocks.. but you could use glass beads or marbles or shells that heavy or packaged sand (because its dry - don't get it off the beach) really anything that would provide weight and you can fit into the canning jar. All in all  I really like these lights... just wish the rings were more resistant to rust! They would make beautiful wedding decor  or other party decor  or individually as gifts with special inserts (weights).  My Mom adores hers.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. If I decided to try and replace the rings I will post how that went.  And I hope this info was helpful to you in some way. UPDATE 8/14/2018.... I have added some photos that might be helpful - while the outer rings have rusted... eh... they are outside.. we are oceanfront (although they would rust outdoors anywhere) -  I consider the rust &#34patina&#34  ... I may not attempt to replace the rings until they are not functional anymore - a couple seasons?? I DO recommend the separate purchase of the handles.  They make the jars a lot easier to move around. Hope this is helpful to you!,0
NOT back lit,large dial corded phone. purchased for use when the power goes out... giant number/buttons... NOT back lit... but super easy to see.  Speaker phone works  handy when you need to keep your hands free.  3 giant boxes for pictures of persons you want to speed dial... I don't use that part... but this phone was designed for an older person I think.  :)  A considerable amount of control options... med  high or very high handset volume... ringer hi/lo or off... and a slide control of the speaker volume...  It has a redial button.  A speaker button.  And a flash button.  It has a red corner on the top left that indicates the ring - so when you have the ring off (and when it is on) that light flashes.  There is a dedicated 911 button that is red. The handset sets in the cradle fairly well at the top... the bottom a bit less... and the bottom is what matters.  If the bottom is off the cradle  the phone registers off the hook. I use it sitting on a corner stand... it does have a hole you could hand on the wall.  It is bright white.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. I hope that the time I took to write this detailed review is helpful to you in some way!,0

narrative is disjointed,A quick read  but a disjointed and lightweight plot. Dead and Gone  the ninth installment in Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire series  is both a curse and a blessing. Let's start with the good news first: the blessing is that it's a quick  breezy read (I finished it in a couple of hours). The curse is that the plot is lightweight  many of the characters are throwaway  and the book reaches a new level of graphic violence on par with HBO's [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]] adaptation.  As I've noted in the most recent Southern Vampire novels  Sookie is starting to show her age. She's currently without a love life she's sworn off Bill after discovering his treachery  she broke off her relationship with weretiger Quinn  and Eric seems to want to claim her for her own (finally  we get some more Eric action!).  In Dead and Gone  Sookie is once again called upon to discover the perpetrator of a gruesome crime when one of her shifter acquaintances is found brutally murdered behind Merlotte's. Like the vampires before them  the Weres have also decided to go mainstream  and this may be the reason behind the death. There's also a secondary plot involving Sookie's fairy connections through her great-grandfather Niall  and of a brewing war between rival fairy factions that threatens Sookie and everyone that she loves.  The main problem with Dead and Gone is that little time is given to what is supposed to be a central theme. Sure  Sookie's fairy heritage has been revealed in bits and pieces over several books  but in Dead and Gone  this plays a central role yet little is revealed about Harris's fairy culture other than the fact that Sookie is constantly in danger. Regarding the level of violence  the bodies pile up with little rhyme or reason characters that have been present in several books are handily dispatched for no apparent reason other than to generate  collateral damage. Several pregnant women are murdered. There are also graphic depictions of crucifixion and torture that may be disturbing to some readers.  The narrative is disjointed and contains numerous errors regarding events in earlier books. The biggest flaw is the lack of interest too much time is spent on the initial murder while the real battle is anticlimactic. The numerous red herrings (Octavia discovering a long-lost flame and moving out  former friend Arlene's betrayal that nearly results in Sookie's demise  Quinn's single appearance  Sookie mentioning her nephew Hunter only twice) only serve to fill pages and do nothing to advance the backstory or the action. Dead and Gone isn't a total loss  but it's not an engrossing read either  more of a beach book that's good for summer afternoons. Yes  it reads quickly  but I felt like precious little had actually occurred in 300 pages. I can only hope that the next installment sees a deeper story and more character development.,0
doesn't expand enough to fit around some things,"Helpful Around Home. I'm 5'6""  so I'm not short  but our kitchen cabinets are way out of my reach. I hate having to drag the step stool in just to reach things on the top shelf. This tool is very helpful in those situations. And it's much smaller than the step stool and fits nicely in the pantry. I like that you can rotate the part that grips onto items. I also like that you can extend it at an angel is you want. It works pretty well for most items. I have found that the claw part (for lack of the official term) doesn't expand enough to fit around some things. I was trying to reach the container of salt so I could refill the shaker and it barely fit around that. Other than that  I like it.",0

phone went dead,Don't buy L G cell phones. This phone was used very few times  after four months good service it went dead.  I called the company  it was still under warranty  but I just got a run around.  I wasted about five hours trying phone calls (and yes  it has been recharged) I was told to mail it back to the company  which I did  and it came back still not working.  I would suggest you never buy an LG product.  I am 83 years old and disabled and returning it to the store is not an option.  I bought it online and now I am stuck.  Carol Jones.

should have read up on it,Nice  but don't expect a snow globe!. Was disappointed when I had to reorder it because it got lost then itcame(the 1st one) so I had to send it back. Was also disappointed because I thought it was a real snow globe. Should have read up on it. My fault.,0
historical aspect,Outstanding debut novel!. I absolutely LOVED this book!  I was looking to fill a gap after finishing eight books of the Outlander series and when I saw this one on NetGalley I knew I had to ask for an ARC. I cannot thank NetGalley and the publishers enough for giving me a copy as I loved every minute of this book.  The author moves seamlessly between two time periods (1917 and 2017) without ever losing the pace of the story or confusing the reader. At the heart of the book is a love story but what I also appreciated about the book is the historical aspect of it all. Catherine Taylor has obviously done her research! I don’t want to give anything away with regards to the plot as I don’t want to spoil it for potential readers so all I can say is if you are a fan of Diana Gabaldon  Kristin Hannah  Kate Morton  Ken Follett et al  then this is a book for your to-read list!  I cannot wait to read more of Catherine Taylor's work as if this outstanding debut is anything to go by  she is an author to watch!,1
outlets,This Vacuum Sucks!. This is my 3rd Shark cordless vacuum. We have 3 floors in our home and now we have one Shark on each floor. Our lower 2 floors are hard surfaces  but the top floor is still carpeted. We want to get hard surfaces up there  but it will be a large undertaking to do so because of all the staging that has to be done while working. Because of the carpet  we have put this Shark upstairs. Prior to this  we were using a traditional vacuum. It's definitely portable. I love not having to deal with the cord and outlets. It's heavier than the other 2 Shark models we have because of the canister. However  it's still lightweight enough that I can maneuver easily with it. The first time I used it  I hadn't intended to remove the canister  but I ended up doing so. I found it easy enough to vacuum with one hand and carrying the canister in the other. The suction is strong enough to pick up dry cat food that gets left around the upstairs feeding station. (We have an elderly cat that's not very mobile  so we keep him upstairs and he's a bit messy.) It also did a good job of picking up the cat litter that gets displaced from the litter box. The head of the vacuum (not sure if that's the correct term  but I'm referring to the part that moves around w/wheels and does the sucking) tilts and moves as you are vacuuming. This was particularly helpful when vacuuming on the stairs. I tried this on the hardwoods on the main floor. It easily picked up the leaves by the front door that made it into the entry way. I really like the display on the machine that shows you how much battery is left. I was able to do all of the upstairs (4 bedrooms)   the stair case  and the entry way and there was 60% battery life remaining. We are happy to get rid of the old traditional style vacuum. This is a major upgrade for us!,1
came with a lot of extras,excellent product. Great product  arrived quickly and was glad I ordered it  came with a lot of extras that would come in handy later.,1
nice size,Good quality  reasonably priced desk/table. This Decoholic computer desk is surprisingly nice for the money. Nicely made  good quality and super easy to put together (took me about 10 minutes and I am usually technically challenged when it comes to this stuff).

overpriced,Full & trial sizes premium beauty products. I like this subscription box because it offers full sized skin care and make up products and they are premium beauty products. However  I do not like the fact that the box does not offer very many products it only offers like five or six and I feel like it’s over priced. I suggest the ipsy subscription that offers make up skin care and products for your body and they come in full and trial sizes and that has been a great subscription box for me.,0

good quality,These bags are a decent thickness.  They add both sides together to get the 9.5 mil. Don't think the bag side is 9.5 mil thick.  It's a total of both sides when laying flat.  The bags are still of good quality.  They are a decent value at approximately 33 cents each.  I would buy these again.  Be careful with hard pointy items such as dehydrated carrots  they can poke through.,1
hang on the drive stick,"car garbage can and kleenex dispenser. The garbage can is small - but wider than I had hoped.  I had wanted to set this can in the side door slot.. but it's too wide.

It MIGHT be leather - can't really tell.  The tissue holder is really a tosser - I can't use it and the tissue included is really awful quality.  So - I am still looking for what I really want.

have to subscribe to something,Fun. My family has enjoyed Just Dance games over the years. This one is a little different because it requires the use of a cell phone. While I'm not crazy about that  it does seem to work well. The song list is pretty good  though as with most of the Just Dance games  I only knew about half of the songs. To access all of the songs  you do have to subscribe to something. Long gone are the days when the purchase of the game included access to all of the songs.,0
base clamp is sturdy and padded,"Decent arm hampered by a couple issues. [[VIDEOID:943921a96fbe3453c9c79a9de29a598]] I've been using the arm for a few days  and I have a few thoughts about it.  First  the good. The arm is quiet  the covers work well to cover the springs  and it holds my Samson Q2U in place without issue.  Next  the meh. The base of the mount is plastic  and with that  there is a wobble (see video) when adjusting the mount  which is not something I'd expect at this price point.  Another issue is with the base clamp. While the clamp itself is sturdy and padded so as not to hurt your desk  there is an ""overhang"" (maybe for use as a headphone holder?)  which severely limits where you can put the mount. As a result  I couldn't put the mount on either side of my desk (my preferred location  and instead had to put it in the computer bay at the front.  Overall  this isn't a terrible arm  and if you can get past the issues I mentioned above  I'd recommend it.",1

holiday recipes,"Retro-inspired country Christmas is a walk down memory lane.... ""The Farm Chicks Christmas"" by Serena Thompson is the follow-up to 2009's [[ASIN:1588168662 The Farm Chicks in the Kitchen: Live Well  Laugh Often  Cook Much]]. The first Farm Chicks book was a countrified cookbook peppered liberally with stories and reminiscences by Serena and Teri  antiques-inspired craft ideas (a reusable stencil was included in the front)  and comfort food: easy recipes for breakfast treats  appetizers  soups and salads  and decadent desserts  over fifty in all.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas "" on the other hand  is written only by Serena  a contributing editor for Country Living magazine and antiques show hostess (her best friend Teri has retired from their business). The book still includes numerous country-inspired craft ideas you'll find decorative  retro-inspired self-adhesive gift tags and notecards at the back  along with various decorating ideas for ""the most wonderful time of the year."" However  the ratio of crafts to recipes is reversed from the first book there are only 17 recipes included at the back with gift-giving suggestions on how to package them.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" captures the magic of childhood Christmases  from family visits to the tree farm (complete with recipe ideas for hot drinks to tote along)  holiday decorating ideas (holiday scalloped bunting  vintage-inspired snowball pompom ornaments  cone trees and vintage funnel trees  banners and more)  and photos of Serena's friends' and family's homes decorated for Christmas.  Much of the book is more like a scrapbooked photo essay  with crafts sprinkled in every few pages. Also  the decorating tips (and included photos) are vintage country in the Farm Chicks fashion: displaying old farm toys standing in coconut snow  for example  or stacking metal funnels to make ""trees."" If you're not a fan of all things country  this probably isn't the holiday book for you.  The included holiday recipes are few  and aimed mostly at gift-giving  like the sweet and salty nuts  mini orange bundt cakes  and various types of cookies (butter cutouts  chocolate-covered peanut butter balls  snowballs  Spritz cookies). As with the previous book  a handy list of metric equivalent charts is provided at the back. I tried the sweet and salty nuts recipe first  and though tasty  I didn't think that the ""sweet"" flavor predominated it was more of a subtle afterthought (there's only 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of honey for 3 cups of nuts).  Overall  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" is a nostalgic walk down a snowy memory lane  but it has narrower mass appeal than ""Farm Chicks in the Kitchen"" due to the reversal of the recipe-to-crafts ratio and the genre-specific decorating style (I enjoyed the many beautiful photographs  but won't find myself making yarn-ball wreaths or filling jars with spare Christmas lightbulbs anytime soon).

easy to switch out and clean,Useful and easy to set up and clip! Has everything you need for all hair types. I was looking for a hair clipper that was versatile and could be used on adults as well as children during this pandemic. This Toovren set is just perfect. It has loads of attachments to be able to do the job professionally and quickly. Parts are easy to switch out and clean. Fits well in my hand and makes hair cutting a breeze (even when my two young grandsons are squirming on my kitchen stool  lol). Highly recommend if you are in the market for a new hairclipper.,1
takes practice,Been obsessed with gels 💅🏻. I've had an obsession with gels with my time off from work these past months and I wanted to try this color changing polish. It comes with designs and while the color itself is dark it does change. I am enjoying trying the designs but man it does take practice!!!,0
didn't count them,Smooth. The rocks in this set are small  but true to what the description states. They are smooth and mostly flat. I didn't count them to make sure that I received 100  but I don't need an exact count  so that's okay if it's not exactly 100.,0
hard plastic,For small eggs. I'm afraid to put eggs in this thing it's made of hard plastic and the holes it has are to small for my large eggs .,0
plain cards,Doodle Christmas Cards Assortment with Envelopes  6 Designs (4 x 6 In  36 Pack). Nothing outstanding about these cards  very plain not very artistic  the only thing is you get a lot for you money  blank inside  I wouldn't reorder these.,0
dizzy,Contains a poisonous toxic chemical formaldehyde. I am highly allergic to formaldehyde   it cause me to be dizzy. Have headaches   watering eyes. Sore throat. I had all these things after using this hair condition one time. I read the remarks  and another person asked Amazon if there was formaldehyde in it  and they referred this person to the manufacturer. Located in Hong Kong   they gave the person the run around on the answer. And never did admit it. It is illegal to put it into anything here in the US. I was exposed to it through 2 different sets of sheets and one face cream. And now this hair conditioner. Ive contacted the manufacturer   but I doubt I'll hear from them!!,0
perfect for working out or lounging,Comfortable. Great quality set. Perfect for working out or lounging. Love the color and thickness of the material. I normally wear a small or medium and the medium fit perfectly. Love the tie waist and ribbed texture.,1
great new book,Treat yourself to some me time!. Love love love this box!! Amazing scents and a great new book that I haven’t read yet! Working as a full time nurse during a pandemic has been stressful! I’m going to love my “me time” this weekend. I originally subbed to the 1 book box but it was so great I upped my subscription to the 2 book box! Can’t wait for the next shipment!,1
Deadpool box,Deadpool on a unicorn. Is probably the best pop I could have asked for. The Deadpool box wasn't for everyone but for those of us that have a slight affinity for unicorns  it couldn't get any better.,1

wonderful,Smuggler’s Bounty Final Boxes EVER!!!. Smugglers Bounty went through a lot. It was wonderful and then not so wonderful. Unfortunately  there’s only TWO boxes left before it’s gone forever. I have enjoyed most of them and perhaps they could’ve continued by adding more interesting trinkets  but perhaps it will evolve into something better as they said something new will come after this is done. So get your October box and get the last box in December. Hopefully they go out with a Bang!!,1

mind blowing,Don't wear your makeup without it. Makes my Maskcara highlight and contour go on like butter and keeps it on all day.  Game changer!!!  The make up is amazing without it  with it mind blowing.,1
compact comes with a mirror,Nice blush  only wish it had come with a brush for applications on the go. This was my first use of Julep makeup. I will say that I was happy to see that the 'petal pink' color does apply lighter on the skin than it looked in the box (I thought it was going to be dark). I was a little disappointed to see that this compact comes with a mirror (nice to have when you are away from your vanity) but doesn't come with a brush. Luckily  I have several makeup brushes that I keep when I apply at home which I used. I will have to purchase a smaller brush to keep with me if I expect to take this in my purse when I go out. This goes on smoothly  light and has a nice finish on my skin.,1
setting in an old  dumpy apartment complex,Fun Premise. I am mildly obsessed with reality TV shows. I watch a few big series  but I love learning about the behind the scenes stuff. This story is about a woman who signs up to be on a reality dating show. She expects it to be like all the other shows where they live in a beautiful mansion and everyone has a beautiful designer wardrobe. However  in an effort to make it more &#34real&#34  the setting is in an old  dumpy apartment complex and they are given a thrift store wardrobe. It was a funny  light read. I enjoyed all the behind the scenes action that showed how unreal a lot of the reality show activities were. I did have a little difficulties keeping all of the contestants straight in the beginning. I'm not sure what could have been done differently to keep that from happening. I read it over the course of two days. Anyway...it was a fun  entertaining story.,0
Twitter,Crazy Twitter. I assume it is great  but Twitter tells me my phone number is used by some one else  I gave them my house phone. HELLO  stupid Twitter tells me they mailed me password  really on a land line phone? Smart Twitter acting stupid. I have my telephone number forever on my Amazon account and smart phone. I do not know how I can get on Twitter. Maybe someone can give me advice for my smart phone  I sure not smart enough to tell Twitter or know how to contact them.,0
disappointed,Not as thick as I thought. Somewhat disappointed with thickness of the towels.,0
characters are pretty rough types,"Wonderful Music & A Gritty  Hard Life Story. One of the best things about this movie is the really good music it has  especially the vocals by a singer I never heard of before this movie.  Her name is Marideth Sisco  a homely  white-haired  rotund lady with the voice of an angel.  Hearing her singing in this movie makes it worth watching for that alone.  Other artists also contributed to the movie and they are all good.  I won't repeat the plot  which other reviewers have covered.  The biggest criticism I have seen is that this is an unfair portrayal of rural country people.  Yes and no.  I am sure there are people who are as scary and nasty as these in the country  but they are few and far between.  Just like anywhere  there are good and bad people in the country  just as in the city.  This is an entertainment movie not a documentary.  The biggest problem I have with the movie is that the actress who plays 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) in the movie seems a little too fresh faced and clean for the role.  Given the responsibility she has in the movie  you would expect her to show more signs of fatigue and despair  even at 17.  And some dirt she is always just too clean looking.  She does a good job in the role and perhaps the contrast between her purity and courage and the roughness  cowardliness and cruelty of those around her is one of the main points of the movie.  This is NOT a ""must see"" movie and is a little uncomfortable to watch at times  as some of the characters are pretty rough types.  For example  ""Teardrop""  the brother-in-law of the main character  sniffs cocaine several times during the movie.  Overall I stayed interested in seeing what was going to happen and the ending was somewhat satisfying.  If you don't want to watch the movie  buy the music soundtrack.  4 stars for the movie 5 stars for the soundtrack.",0
not match,HORRIBLE PRODUCT. This arch is a very bad product. Horrible product! It started out ok  but the holes do not match  once you start to connect the seating part.  I could not get it together. So  now I am stuck with a piece of junk that cannot be put together! I called amazon and told them the problem. I was told to take the unit down and repackage it for return the next day. I am 72 years old with heart problems and I had a hard enough time putting the top part together! Told them to pick it up like it was because I could not take the parts down  they refused! Now  I am stuck with junk  and I paid a lot of money for this junk  on a retirement salary. Please read some of the reviews  I wish I had before making the purchase. The holes do not match and I do not know how to make new holes and I should not have to do that! Beware before you buy this product.!,0
nice planner,This planner is an older version  be aware that it is for 2019. This is a nice planner  but it is older and will expire at the end of the year.  It is not a good value even if it was for this year and next.  It's basically a notebook with a calendar pages.  I would value it at no more than $12.,1
more of it in the package,loved it. wasnt sure what to expect  it was good  i wish there was more of it in the package for the price though  im gonna look around for other options to order,0
soft and comfy,Soft and comfy. This pajama set is super comfortable  very soft and stretchy so I could use it for breastfeeding. The top was shorter than I thought so I couldn’t really use it as a postpartum pajama in the hospital but it fits perfectly now that all the seeking has gone away.,1
flat saddles,Not for plus sized gals. I weighed about 250 when I got this saddle  now about 233.  The saddle was great.  I love flat saddles and this is one but then after a month of use  the middle started to sag  so it then felt like a saddle with a swoop.  This then gave me pressure sores.  I have actual notice this issue with the middle sinking down with most Terry saddles.  I think they are made for ladies who weigh less.  Even when not on the saddle now  you can just put your hands on the middle and it just sinks down  like it is just cloth on plastic.  So this saddle is great if you weigh less than I did.,0
as expected,Five Stars. Finally! Correct size. As expected.,1

matchmaking,"A lovely tale of matchmaking  true love and modern India. Hyder Ali  a retired clerk  is driving his patient wife crazy with his post-retirement boredom. They are a Muslim couple living in Visakhapatnam (Vizag)  a coastal city in Andhra Pradesh in eastern India. His only son  Rehman  is a political activist dedicated to helping India's exploited  which gets him into trouble with the police (and his father). Mr. Ali decides to start a marriage bureau to earn extra income  and in doing so  finds unexpected happiness and reconciliation.  Mr. Ali  aided by his shrewd wife  quickly gains numerous clients seeking arranged marriages. Farahad Zama does a great job of easing Western readers into India's complicated caste system  along with its many restrictions  without departing from the story and events at hand. Some of the families insist on the unobtainable (the perfect wife: beautiful  pale complexion  English-speaking  rich  matching caste  or a software engineer husband in California)  but Mr. Ali is able to match several successfully.  The two main foci are the situation with Mr. Ali's son Rehman  who is arrested for participating in a political protest  and the unfortunate situation of Mr. Ali's young secretary Aruna  who was forced to drop out of graduate school due to her father's prolonged illness and their precarious economic situation. The narratives weave together seamlessly  along with the fruits of Mr. and Mrs. Ali's matchmaking prowess.  Indian culture is the real star here: the contrast between ancient traditions and modernity. We're given a taste of how Vizag's Christians  Muslims  and Hindus live side by side  of the intricacies of Muslim and Hindu weddings  and the sprawling Indian bureaucracy. There are numerous culinary delights  from rooh afza to idli  coconut chutney  and prasaadam. The author thoughtfully includes several cultural primers masquerading as Mrs. Ali's English ""essays"" that give the reader a background into Vizag  the caste system and Urdu and Telugu words for extended family. It reminded me of the recent excellent Vine selection [[ASIN:1416583688 The Case of the Missing Servant: A Vish Puri Mystery]]  another novel set in India that also dealt with Indian arranged marriages and Indian culture and customs.  A delightful  sparkling read that is full of moments of humor and unexpected tenderness  ""The Marriage Bureau for Rich People"" showcases both the good and bad of modern India: corruption and poverty tempered by quiet generosity and strong communities. Romantic and light without being cloying  this is a perfect summer read that fans of Indian culture will be sure to enjoy.",1

hard,Very small.. I was looking forward to receiving these brackets.  But  they are too small to use.  I do not have a broad face  big nose  chin  or big head.  These do not cover my nose and chin at the same time.  They are more for a child’s face.  It’s too much of a bother to send them back so I’ll be giving them to my son for the grandchildren. I have 3 different cloth masks and they don’t work with any of them.  They move around  possibly because they’re so small.  Also  being silicon  I expected them to be at least a bit softer but they are hard.  Very disappointed.,0
different size prints,Cuteness. Love the different size prints  I am a hobby crafter and make various items  signs and home decor. These are great for my River Run Rustic Wood Crafts.,1
noise,"Mixed blessing  but so far  so good. I looked at probably 20 portable ice makers before choosing this one. Price was a factor  but so was customer input from reviews. It seemed like many of the other models were the exact same machine with a different company label stuck on them  and their reviews were so varied  it seemed like you either got a lemon or a good one.  Also  all the others opened at the top and vented on the side. For some reason  I thought this one would work better in our area  with the drawer pulling out at the front  and I THOUGHT the vent would be at the side like all the other machines.  My purpose in buying this is not for a bar or camper  like many people. I am partially disabled  and can't get downstairs to the kitchen on any sort of regular basis. I really wanted to be able to have ice when I wanted some  especially with the heat of summer rolling in very  very soon. I don't like room temperature drinks  esp water or tea  so I'd found myself drinking Pepsi almost exclusively  the only thing I could stand at room temp. That needed to stop!  So  I ended up buying this one  but the experience was not a pleasant one. I love my Amazon prime dearly  but they really botched this one. The shipping dates got moved around even after I paid extra for one-day shipping  and ended up with this being delivered on a totally different day  when I was the only one home and could not come to the door. (Note that Amazon did end up giving me a small credit on my acct to try to make up for the shipping problem  even though it did not solve my problem.) I always chat with the UPS guys through the upstairs window  so they left it for me anyway. I knew my son would be home very shortly after  and he was. He brought the box up  and I have to say that I am almost positive I got a customer return. The box looked like it had previous shipping labels peeled off of it. The box was beat up  torn  and had a crushed in spot on the side. Our UPS guys are really great  so I think it was shipped out from Day One looking like that - who in the warehouses think customers really want something that looks that bad?! (And yes  I know this is a product review section  and I can file shipping problems elsewhere  and I will. Just giving folks a heads-up of how it is shipped and what I received.) This is shipped in its original mfg box with tie cords on it  there is no other packaging other than what the mfg sends it out with - no Amazon packaging whatsoever. Strike One.  I opened the box  not sure of what I would find. It only has two big strips of styrofoam on the sides to hold it. Ours indeed had a dent in the side  and one of the back exhaust fans had cracked plastic. Not a crisis  but at this price  I really do expect a brand new item in great condition! Strike Two.  SMELLS/TASTE: I read a lot of reviews that talk about the plastic smell and/or taste in the cubes  and how it didn't seem to want to fire up well. IF someone reads the directions (not everyone likes to do that!)  you'd see it says to make sure the machine sits for at least an hour to allow the coolant to properly settle back into place after you unpack it. This particular model also says to run a bleach solution through it to help clean it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT!! The machine indeed smells heavily of plastic. Anyone who has had a relay switch burn out on an item knows what smell I am talking about - sort of like melting plastic. Ugh. However  having read plenty about portable ice makers before buying one  I knew that either vinegar or lemon juice would also work just fine. I chose to go with one that was ingestible  rather than bleach!! We did the lemon juice  and ran an entire cycle of cubes through it with the lemon/water. (Toss the ice please!) I then ran two loads (all the cubes a full water tank would make) through it of plain water. AFTER those cycles  I wiped it out again and ran regular water through it to try making cubes we'd use. We had no problems at all with any funny tastes in our ice this way. If you have a bad quality of tap water though  I'd suggest using either bottled  filtered or distilled water. It is only natural that your cubes will not taste better than your tap water. Ours is okay  so we're good that way. I would have bought a water filter (like a Brita) if that had not been the case. No lemony taste  no plastic taste  no gross tastes or odors at all. (Remember  I really do NOT recommend using bleach like the mfg suggests. While I understand the germ-killing properties of the bleach  I really don't want to ingest any of it. I would also think it would be much more caustic to the plastic parts and hoses of the machine  wearing them out sooner. Stick with lemon juice.) It did smell like plastic out the exhaust fan for quite a while  but it is fading away.  NOISE: Of course it is going to make noise. This has a compressor  and it will be making some noise. However  I've found that at its noisiest part of the cycle  it is no different than a microwave oven running  sometimes a little quieter.The ice cubes dumping make me jump a little bit  at least at first  but then again I am easily startled. Made the cats jump too! LOL! However  they are pretty much used to it now  even if they eyeball it suspiciously while it is running.  I have to say that I haven't stopped to time an actual cycle to make the ice. I've tried the small  medium and large cubes though. They are all gumdrop-shaped (or like the Dots candy at the movies)  with a hole in the middle of the bottom. It didn't seem to take very long though. The small ones were a little too small for my uses  but would be good for smaller drink glasses. I use a [[ASIN:B003X46LHG Bubba Brands Keg 52 Oz Mug Slate Gray]] to hold the ice at the moment  and love it. If you use the medium size  you can get the first batch in around 10 minutes  but the other batches do seem to take longer for some reason. It has also seemed to get ""stuck"" where it runs and runs  with nothing going on. I turn it off  let it sit a minute and push start again  and off it goes. I am not sure if it is just my machine with the dents from rough handling  or if all of this model is like that.  I was disappointed that this unit does not exhaust on the side  reason being where I planned to locate it  on a table behind my bed! It would vent towards my pillow  which is just not gonna happen. So  I have it turned sideways so it will vent towards the doorway. It makes opening the ice drawer more awkward  and makes me wish I'd tried one of the top-opening models now. There wasn't anything in the photos and such to suggest that this unit would be different than most of the other portable ice makers. It is. I'll post photos at a later date.  This model's book also suggests plugging the machine in to a GFI outlet  or grounded plug that will shut off if it senses dampness. I don't have one in the bedroom  and currently am using a heavy-duty  three-prong extension cord and plugging it in in the bathroom  where we do have a GFI plug. Not ideal  but better than trying to get a special outlet installed in a rented bedroom.  The scoop is VERY tiny. It works best to scoop towards you  so you don't send ice cubes back into the machine. The measuring cup works well for pouring  because you have a small reservoir to fill  and you have to go over a small clear rubber ""wall"" that helps to hold the drawer in place and hold temperatures.  Any unused ice does indeed melt back into the reservoir and is recycled back into cubes. Once I have enough ice for anyone who wants it  I turn it off rather than let it continually cycle. I also unplug it in the evenings when I go to bed for the night  since I'm the only one who can't go downstairs for ice if they want it. I hope that saves on the ""vampire electricity"" of the unit. Note that this is not a refrigerated ice maker  and the unused ice WILL melt. Many people complained about ice cubes stuck together - I've only experienced that when getting ice that has been done for an hour or so (it keeps the ice for at least an hour after the last cycle at this point) - otherwise  the cubes are all loose and easy to use. If you try to take the ice drawer all the way out after leaving the ice sit for a while  it WILL leak water on you - the water is simply the ice melting back and going through the drain holes that let it run back into the reservoir. (Nope - I didn't even think about the drainage holes when I pulled the drawer out the first time  and had water on the table and the floor. That was my fault though.)  For now  I am mostly happy with it. I cannot tell you how nice it is to have ice when I want it  instead of waiting for someone to get home in the evening and get me some! It was an expensive luxury though  and one I really thought long and hard about getting since I can no longer work. I'm thinking I really want to keep it. The cosmetic issues were VERY annoying  since I paid for a new machine  not a used one  but in this case  I blame Amazon for sending this out with a crushed box from the get-go. I would not have accepted it  had I been able to get to the door and saw it. Again - for some reason  this was the most problematic purchase I've ever had in all my time on Amazon.  This machine has not reached Strike Three yet  but you can be sure I'll come back and update my review should that happen. For now  I'll keep running it  and see how it seems to work  dents  cracked exhaust grid and all. (The dents are even more annoying  because it has a stainless steel appearance. It shows readily. It was more of a hassle to return it than to just keep it  as long as it continues to work.)  UPDATE June 29  2012: Well  I've had this machine for a little over a month now. Is it perfect? Nope. Does it make ice? Yep. Does it make a little noise?  Yep  but not unbearable. So far  the broken parts do not seem to be affecting the basic function of the machine. While I still have not literally timed the cube cycle (I have good intentions  but seems like there's always something better to do than watch the clock for ice cubes to drop! Ha!)  I have found the medium cubes to be the most useful. In fact  I often use an empty Sobe Lifewater bottle to make quick tea (loving the new tea from Lipton with the honey in it)  and the medium cubes fit in this bottle perfectly. So  that might give folks a better idea about the size of the medium cube. The difference in the sizes are basically more (or less) layers of ice on the cubes. The small ones are still too big for a basic 16.9 oz water bottle  and melt too fast when I shake up my tea. The first batch of the day takes around 10 minutes  but for some reason  they are skinnier than the normal mediums. The machine makes additional batches inbetween 10-15 minutes. Around 2 or 2-1/2 of the water cup it comes with to fill the reservoir to maximum. That will fill the ice bin to the top with medium cubes.  At this point  I increased my stars by one  because of the function of the machine  and it being willing to do what I ""hired"" it to do - keep me in cold drinks. Strike three has not yet happened  and I hope it doesn't! Enjoy!",0
awful controls,Excercise in Frustration. Consider this game an Excercise in Frustration.  Awful controls make for nearly impossible tasks (not good for 5-7 year olds) I find it interesting that this game might only appeal to the very young &lt 5 and yet the game requires lots of READING? So the parents get dragged in to help out and the game is torture for adults. Mind numbingly boring and complete frustration on impossible tasks. I about thru the controller at the TV (not good when playing with my son)  PS This game is not at all like the other My Sims games and not free-roaming or free building. It's essentially a bunch of impossible puzzles for 5 year olds (that requires adults to try and help)  STAY AWAY !!,0
keeps the area cleaner,just what i needed. so far one cat  (the one i was concerned about using it)  went in  so  so far so good  i think the other one will be fine with it and i love the HIGH sides  hopefully will keep the area cleaner without litter all over the place,1
"""rugged"" one","nice set. id give it 5 stars except i dont like how the phones sit in the chargers  they lean forward instead of backward including the base  i hope these live longer than my last set  i lost display on each of them  by dropping them  people drop things panasonic  you should make them a bit more sturdy and i know they have a ""rugged""  one but 60 for one handset is a bit ridiculous too",0

quality,its fun and this price here was great. We use this spinner on game day and remove it until the next week or next game. If you intend on leaving it out for any extended period of time  it will not last. But as long as its taken care of  its fun and this price here was great. I paid $40.00 for this same spinner a few years ago in a local sports shop.,0
control it in the shower,Great way to scrub and exfoliate!. I have been using scrubs in the shower for the past few years. I have really dry  crepey skin and scrubs really help. I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw these cubes  couldn't figure out if I would be able to control it in the shower (trying to get it onto my legs and arms). I was pleasantly surprised  however  to see how easy it was.  As I begin to use it the cube stays in the palm of my hand and begins to 'melt' slowly as I moved it up and down my arms and legs. There was plenty to go around and it was super easy to use. My skin felt amazing after just one use. I really did like the fragrance  too. I will be buying a few more of these for myself and also as stocking stuffers for my two daughter-in-laws (a unique gift). Highly recommend!,1
electronic metronomes,Solid instrument that can help with not only time  but dynamics and listening skills. I received this as a free review sample. Since there are a number of very detailed reviews I am going to stick to how I use it as a drummer.  First  if you are practicing dynamics  this is an excellent tool. Of course it's designed to develop a sense of time  but it produces a beat in the 60 dB range at one meter. For a drummer this is somewhere in the P to PP range  so if you combine time keeping exercises with dynamics  this is an invaluable tool that I suspect most drummers will overlook because it's based on a design that is literally hundreds of years old. Trust me  this is effective. Moreover  since it is not incredibly loud it reinforces listening skills. I used this for a solid week in my practice room before writing this review and can make the claim that if you are a trained drummer this metronome has the potential to improve your dynamics  listening and time.  A nice thing is this is not as delicate as the old style metronomes upon which the design is based. It's not a toy and does need to be treated with care  but I owned a much older instrument that was temperamental and did not like being moved or handled much. This one is more robust.  Bottom line: if you are uncertain if this will be loud enough  download a copy of [[ASIN:B0054KJND6 Decibel-O-Meter Free]] and measure your own instrument's sound pressure level at one meter and determine if this metronome will be loud enough. For some instruments it may not be  but for many like an acoustic piano  guitar  etc. it will be. For folks like me this works for certain exercises like those I mentioned and it is a lot more pleasant than some of the electronic metronomes I have tried.,0
quality product,"Feel liek they will fall apart quickly.

perfect firmness,Great Neck Cushion. Soft and comfortable.  These are just what I needed under the headrests of my new car.  I have no idea why head rests now come sort of tilted forward  and in my particular car (Toyota Corolla) there is no way to tilt them back.  It feels like my head is being forced forward.  So  these pillows are the perfect touch to give my neck the needed cushion while I'm driving or as a passenger.  They're the perfect firmness  not too soft and not too firm.,1

I wouldn't let a kid fly this unless he is carefully supervised.  i'm an adult with experience flying rc planes.  i was not comfortable when I turned it on.  it could really hurt someone.  there are a few quirks that don't get explained but there are enough users out there that help.,0
satin finish,"stainless handles 3"" centers. Purchased these to help finish a minor bathroom remodel.  They are slight curved so the edges tend not to hook clothing - which is good.  Smooth and a satin finish.  I really like them.  They are what I would consider a medium weight - not super heavy but not lightweight either.  Look like more than I paid for them in my opinion",1

puppy loves it,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
nicely made quality shoes,True to size  comfortable for all day wearing. Really nicely made quality shoes.  Stitches are tight and color (blue) is a beautiful hue. Shoes fit perfectly. My son  who's a school teacher  does a lot of walking throughout the day and told me that after wearing these for a week non-stop  his feet had no pain (he has high arches) and actually felt supported and relaxed. I highly recommend these for everyday or more dressy wear.,1
flavor is nice,REALLY GOOD. I LIKE THIS PRODUCT. THE FLAVOR IS NICE AND YOU CAN USE IT ON ALL KIDS OF DISHES. I'VE USED IT ON BEEF  FISH  HOTDOGS  ETC. TRY IT  I THINK YOU WILL LIKE IT TOO.,1
intended to stick on the wall,Easy to Assemble. I was a little alarmed when I first opened this and saw that they were not assembled. However  assembly was easy and I didn't even have to read the instruction booklet to do so. I am using this toothbrush holder directly on the counter without the adhesive. When I ordered it  I didn't even notice that it was intended to stick on the wall. It's doing fine on the counter. It keeps my sonic toothbrush upright better than it was doing on its own. There are 2 toothbrush holders in this set.,0
best,One of the best. Great box for cats   tried many   one of the best,1
maneuvers easily,Great styling brush!. This is a great brush. Quality made  strong bristles  it works perfectly on my shoulder length hair. I typically like to straighten my hair so I spend quite a while brushing and blow drying my hair every morning. This brush is a perfect size for me  fits well in my hand and maneuvers easily. Just perfect. I ordered another for my guest bathroom for when people visit. Highly recommend!,1
shipped very quickly,Fantastic. This is a great record with 2 great songs on it  and it was shipped very quickly  two thumbs up!,1
Peggy Lee,A pairing made in heaven.... Long before she became known as a sultry sex kitten with 1950's smash hit Fever  Peggy Lee had practiced her sexier side with Benny Goodman on hits such as Why Don't You Do Right. Lee received her big break in 1941 when Benny Goodman heard her sing his vocalist Helen Forrest was about to leave his band  and he was looking for a replacement. A few days later  Lee recorded Elmer's Tune  the first track on The Complete Recordings 1941-1947. That same year  several more of Lee/Goodman's arrangements went on to be hits  including I Got It Bad and Winter Weather.  The Complete Recordings gathers 38 tracks by Lee and Goodman  despite the fact that Lee married Goodman's guitarist Dave Barbour and took a year off  returning to work on her solo career with Barbour (in 1945  she signed a solo contract with Capitol). 32 of the tracks were recorded between 1941 and 1942 and displayed Peggy Lee's widening range to perfection  from blues (Blues in the Night)  ballads (How Deep is the Ocean?  How Long Has This Been Going On?  When the Roses Bloom Again  Where or When  The Way You Look Tonight)  holiday tunes (Winter Weather)  uptempo numbers (Let's Do It  The Freedom Train)  and everything in between. It's amazing to hear how she matures from that first jittery performance on Elmer's Tune to the confident vocalist she'd become.  The remastering has produced a crisp  clear sound  and the discs are printed to look like the old vinyl labels that Columbia's used with Frank Sinatra reissues. The excellent liner notes are by the incomparable Will Friedwald  who writes for all the Sinatra Columbia / Capitol reissues and releases  and include rare photos and a complete list of original catalog numbers  recording dates  and studio personnel. This is a fabulous investment for fans of Big Band (Goodman in particular) and Peggy Lee  but any fan of the Great American Songbook and music of the 1940s will find much to enjoy here.,1
small birds will not eat the peanuts,MOSTLY PEANUTS. This product is mostly peanuts. The small birds will not eat the peanuts. I have mostly sparrows and I came outside to find the small amounts of seeds  in the mixture  all gone. The peanuts were still in the feeder. Birds did not eat. I was surprised as I thought birds would eat anything. But they will not eat these huge peanuts. I would not recommend this product for smaller birds. I can buy a bag of peanuts for a lot cheaper  if I did not want the birds to eat them.,0
clear plastic rectangle on the rear,Tin is reusable by kids who love cupcakes. I recently sent two of these as birthday gifts and the Mom got the loaded gift cards with instructions to let the kids have the tins since I could not bring them edible cupcakes.  From purchases in the past  I was aware that they are pretty thin in depth as well as the metal gauge and I knew that there is a clear plastic rectangle on the rear which provides Amazon to identify the code on the card inside of the tin.  The kids didn't mind that and the Mom didn't mind sharing her gift.  I suspect that the funds embedded in the cards eventually went to buying items for the kids anyway because she's a sharing person.  This is one of my favorite physical gift cards from Amazon which I enjoy sending.,0
tone,Really like the tone. Really like the tone  should have purchased the mallet. Jury will be out for a while on whether DNA responds  not exactly sure how I would measure that. On another &#34note&#34  my dog really finds it annoying. So  I only use it when he is outside for brief periods of time.,1
good price,Five Stars. Favorite soap at a good price.,1
West,"A welcome return. Brian has returned to original compositions after two cover CDs of Irish songs (On Song and On Song 2)  and ""Homebird"" is a brilliant return to his earlier songwriting form on such albums as ""A Better Man"" and ""Get On With Your Short Life."" This limited edition features a bonus CD with 13 acoustic songs  three of which are not featured on the studio cuts: the amazing  tragic Silver Hearts on Chains  Sea of Stars and You Are.  Of the thirteen studio cuts  the standouts include If You Don't Believe In Me  Destination  Homebird and West.  I thought that the acoustic bonus CD was actually the stronger of the two discs. The studio cuts are so low key that many practically sound indistinguishable from their acoustic counterparts. In fact  I enjoy some of the acoustic tracks more. Silver Hearts on Chains may be the undiscovered gem that *should* have been on the studio CD.  Overall  ""Homebird"" is a wonderful treat for Brian's fans.",1
fat reduced cocoa,fresh and soft. These are subtle licorice pieces. There are pieces that are predominately coconut. I like them.  My bag arrived with a distant &#34use by date&#34 and was soft and fresh. For me  I am so happy to read the ingredient list.  No red dye #40 or yellow #5 or 6.  Here is the ingredient list on the bag: Sugar  cane molasses  wheat flour  glucose syrup (contains sulphites)  desiccated coconut  palm oil  beef gelatin  corn starch  glycerol  natural colors (plain caramel  beetroot red  curcumin  paprika). fat reduced cocoa  licorice exctract  natural flavorings (aniseed  lemon  raspberry  vanilla  orange) glazing agent (beeswax) fruit and vegetable juices for coloring. Allergy alert: equipment shared with products that include peanuts  tree nuts  milk  egg  soy and wheat. NOT a health food.  But a delightful treat without harmful dyes still legal in the USA.,1
nostalgic walk down a snowy memory lane,"Retro-inspired country Christmas is a walk down memory lane.... ""The Farm Chicks Christmas"" by Serena Thompson is the follow-up to 2009's [[ASIN:1588168662 The Farm Chicks in the Kitchen: Live Well  Laugh Often  Cook Much]]. The first Farm Chicks book was a countrified cookbook peppered liberally with stories and reminiscences by Serena and Teri  antiques-inspired craft ideas (a reusable stencil was included in the front)  and comfort food: easy recipes for breakfast treats  appetizers  soups and salads  and decadent desserts  over fifty in all.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas "" on the other hand  is written only by Serena  a contributing editor for Country Living magazine and antiques show hostess (her best friend Teri has retired from their business). The book still includes numerous country-inspired craft ideas you'll find decorative  retro-inspired self-adhesive gift tags and notecards at the back  along with various decorating ideas for ""the most wonderful time of the year."" However  the ratio of crafts to recipes is reversed from the first book there are only 17 recipes included at the back with gift-giving suggestions on how to package them.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" captures the magic of childhood Christmases  from family visits to the tree farm (complete with recipe ideas for hot drinks to tote along)  holiday decorating ideas (holiday scalloped bunting  vintage-inspired snowball pompom ornaments  cone trees and vintage funnel trees  banners and more)  and photos of Serena's friends' and family's homes decorated for Christmas.  Much of the book is more like a scrapbooked photo essay  with crafts sprinkled in every few pages. Also  the decorating tips (and included photos) are vintage country in the Farm Chicks fashion: displaying old farm toys standing in coconut snow  for example  or stacking metal funnels to make ""trees."" If you're not a fan of all things country  this probably isn't the holiday book for you.  The included holiday recipes are few  and aimed mostly at gift-giving  like the sweet and salty nuts  mini orange bundt cakes  and various types of cookies (butter cutouts  chocolate-covered peanut butter balls  snowballs  Spritz cookies). As with the previous book  a handy list of metric equivalent charts is provided at the back. I tried the sweet and salty nuts recipe first  and though tasty  I didn't think that the ""sweet"" flavor predominated it was more of a subtle afterthought (there's only 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of honey for 3 cups of nuts).  Overall  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" is a nostalgic walk down a snowy memory lane  but it has narrower mass appeal than ""Farm Chicks in the Kitchen"" due to the reversal of the recipe-to-crafts ratio and the genre-specific decorating style (I enjoyed the many beautiful photographs  but won't find myself making yarn-ball wreaths or filling jars with spare Christmas lightbulbs anytime soon).

thick screen protector,"okay  but not as good as people suggest. well  I bought one base on the rave reviews of this product  it functions  but far less from perfect.  - what is right about every past reviews is  it doesn't have bubbles and easy install.  - and the reason for that - this screen protector is so thick and it is nothing like we usually expect.  - and the results of that is  it decrease the brightness of the screen ""significantly"" - the first time I applied  the screen go so dark and for a moment  I thought I got it wrong. The fix of course is to increase the brightness setting - my guesstimate is you need to double the brightness of whatever is comfortable to you before.  - and the result of that is  your battery life will decrease  as the screen is a major source of power consumer.  - another minor issue i had is  the alignment of front facing camera is difficult  as it is so small and it is very easy to cover the hole --- the home button is more forgiving as it is relatively large  but not the small front facing camera holes.",0
hard to engage in anything,cat string on stick toy. I get more joy out of these than my daughter's cat does.... sigh.... she doesn't seem too interested... she is hard to engage in anything though and she's older ( 7+ years).... I am thinking if you had a kitten it would be the bomb.. and maybe with a little catnip??,0
handles are not round,"Our handles are not round  these work fine.... I think these things would look more form fitting if your handles were round. That may just be my mind playing tricks on me. If our handles were round  I might think these look better on the flat handles. LOL! In any case  they get the job done. But up close  the fabric does not feel premium  it's on the cheap side. But you need to consider what you're spending for 6 pieces. The higher quality stuff is more expensive and does not come with 6 pieces. The term  ""you get what you pay for"" comes to mind. So I'm not going to deduct a star for that. I think this is 5-Stars for the price you're paying.",0
Favorite soap,Five Stars. Favorite soap at a good price.,1
Herman's Hermits,a musical train wreck. Connie Francis! Herman's Hermits! Liberache! Louie Armstrong! Probably the most incredible mish-mash of musical talent ever assembled in one movie. It makes you wish it was available on DVD. The music is actually quite good  very fun and listenable  a great slice of americana  some really nice standards mixed in with some really horrible train wrecks  it is very much worth the listen just for the kitch value.,1
waistband may roll down a bit,Runs a Bit Small. These are good leggings for all types of workouts. The fabric is very soft and stretchy. There's good tummy control. The waistband may roll down a bit while doing some exercises. The fit runs a bit small. I sized up for comfort.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,0

Neon Red wouldn't look so much like HOT PINK,Great sound! Very comfortable. I'm watching Charlie and the Chocolate factory on my MacBook Air with these headphones.  The sound is awesome!  I haven't tried the mic yet.  They block out outside sounds very well.  If the Neon Red wouldn't look so much like HOT PINK  my husband would wear them when mowing the lawn.  The mic and speaker control are on the left.  These headphones are also very comfortable. They fit my small head as well as my husband's bigger head.  The actual speaker section moves within the frame of the headset so that they lay better on the side of your head.  As someone else said  be careful which color you choose because Neon Red is not red.,0

pockets ladies,Floral tank dress with pockets. Oh man.. these dresses are the cat's meow.  I bought 2 and came back to order 2 more.  I am 5'7&#34... 38DDD  usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  The XX fits me perfectly. I am a little busty so it's sort of empirish.. but doesn't look maternity.  And the best part?? POCKETS ladies!! Oh yes.  Lovely pockets that don't stick out. Just handy.  I wear them over my swimsuits... I dress them up with jewelry... and/or a jacket.  The prints are vibrant and clear.  The wash beautifully (I wash on delicate and tumble dry on &#34low&#34).  If you try one  you'll come back for more I bet.  This dress would fit a wide range of body types in my opinion. Further  as I travel a fair amount  they pack so nicely  without wrinkles!  Love love love. And I rarely get to say that about clothes of any kind. UPDATE:  10/3 ...  I've gone back to order 2 other prints.  They wash beautifully.  Wear so comfortably.  The pockets are the key. Would love if they would come up with a sleeved version!,1

author has done her research,Outstanding debut novel!. I absolutely LOVED this book!  I was looking to fill a gap after finishing eight books of the Outlander series and when I saw this one on NetGalley I knew I had to ask for an ARC. I cannot thank NetGalley and the publishers enough for giving me a copy as I loved every minute of this book.  The author moves seamlessly between two time periods (1917 and 2017) without ever losing the pace of the story or confusing the reader. At the heart of the book is a love story but what I also appreciated about the book is the historical aspect of it all. Catherine Taylor has obviously done her research! I don’t want to give anything away with regards to the plot as I don’t want to spoil it for potential readers so all I can say is if you are a fan of Diana Gabaldon  Kristin Hannah  Kate Morton  Ken Follett et al  then this is a book for your to-read list!  I cannot wait to read more of Catherine Taylor's work as if this outstanding debut is anything to go by  she is an author to watch!,1
easy to read paragraphs,50 States and where to go book. Santa brought this to me this year  because we travel for work to a lot of different places all over the world and the US.  I am looking forward to using it as a fun reference for wherever we are headed.  Lots of full color pictures and easy to read paragraphs on ideas of what and where to go.  Hardback.,1
support,Nice range in colors  but flimsy shafts.. The package was nicely divided and orderly  and the array of colors/textures (flavors) is very delightful  says my cat. However  as I was affixing clasps to the feather spine shafts to make toys for my cat  they keep breaking with very little pressure applied by myself.  While I realize these are craft feathers  the stems should not be so fragile and hollow that they have very little support to last for whatever project they are being used for (you can crush them between two fingers very easily). That's the ONLY reason why I subtracted stars.,0
not for sports,Slip off too easy. Not durable. Not for sports.. They seem to fit right. But they slip off too easy. Can't do much more than walk in them. Bought for my 6 year old for soccer and he lost his shoe more times than he kicked the ball. Frustrating to say the least. Also hard to get on even with the laces all the way loose. Really not happy and don't recommend.,0
extra screws,heavy duty table leg levelers. Super heavy duty as advertised. Extra screws  that were also good quality - didn't strip as screws were placed.  Hubby was really pleased.  You get 4 feet and includes extra screws.  Would buy again.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All my reviews reflect my personal experience with the reviewed item and I receive NO free products or discounts that are available to all shoppers.,1

pumpkin in turmeric and coconut milk,A gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!. When I think of Malaysian dishes  it’s the spicy  layered flavors of Norman Musa’s “Amazing Malaysian” that I think of. It opens with street food and snacks  and moves on to seafood  meat  vegetables  rice and noodles  pudding and drinks  and the Malaysian pantry. Gorgeous photos of street scenes in Malaysia pepper the pages  while the gold-embossed cover looks great sitting out on a table or countertop.  You'll find street snack favorites like chicken satay  net pancakes  roti canai  and fried spring rolls  along with Indian lentil patties  grilled fish paste in banana leaf  tofu stuffed with crunchy vegetables  and the gorgeous Kak Besah’s curry puffs. The seafood dishes reminded me of many preparations I had last year while working in Taiwan whole fish steamed with lemongrass  ginger and chilies  squid stir fry  and scrambled eggs with oysters. The meat dishes featured are mostly chicken and beef (no pork unlike Ping’s book)  with lamb curry  beef rendang  and numerous chicken dishes.  One of my new favorite recipes is the Nyonya Vermicelli Noodle Salad  which features rice noodles  tofu beansprouts  and ginger with plenty of lime juice and fresh herbs (if you are vegetarian  leave out the shrimp paste and prawns). I also loved the Malay Vegetable Dhal Curry  pumpkin in turmeric and coconut milk  and eggs in chili sambal (think shakshuka).  Rice and noodle dishes include tomato rice (nasi tomato)  wok-fried flat noodles  curry laksa  chicken rice  herbal rice  and several egg-fried rices in addition to fried noodles. Desserts range from the effortless (fresh mango  honey and coconut  tropical fruit salad) to the more elaborate (pandan custard and sticky rice layered sweet  sticky rice balls  soy panna cotta with passion fruit and crushed chocolate cookies. And you’ll find any number of refreshing drinks  from lemongrass and honey tea and rose syrup drink to pulled sweet tea and iced fresh lime juice.  At the end are several staple condiments  from the ubiquitous chili paste and ginger soy sauce  to sambals (chili  coconut)  sauces  and vegetable pickles.  Norman Musa’s recipes tend to be a bit more advanced but also result in more complex  nuanced flavors. This is a gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!,1

great for freezing food,Perfect for many uses!!!. Great bags and great for multiple purposes. Not only are they great for refrigerated foods (cheese  fruits  vegetables) but I find them great for freezing food as well (works best if you squeeze all the air out before sealing the bag). Needless to say  they also work well for lunch bag use (although they may be a little large unless you are storing more than one sandwich). However  most of all I also love these for storing small items around the house. I have bags of nails and picture hangers in these out in the garage  spools of threads and pins in my laundry room  I use them in the bathroom for small cosmetic items and hair pins and the smaller children use them for crayons and picture puzzle pieces. I honestly can't say enough about the versatility and the great variety of things you can do with these Ziploc slider bags. Every house should have at least one box of them available at all times. Can be used for so many purposes.,1
almost kind of rank or weird scent,The scent is not the same as it used to be.  I don't know why they changed it but they did. It's not the same I used to use. Scent went from soft and baby powder to almost kind of rank or weird.  I feel like this is the new Coke ... They changed something that wasn't broken.  I won't launder anything in it except bath towels and bathmats now.  Very disappointed as I thought it would give clothes the soft scent that it always gave my daughter's clothes..  I'm just going to stick with tide free and clear even tho I was hoping for a little soft scented aroma therapy on pillowcases and sheets.,0

inflexible,"Decent  But Expensive Not Fully Functional on New Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" Tablet. CROSSWORDS by Standalone is a decent crossword puzzle app  but inflexible and expensive.  On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet  the working display shows about two-thirds of a weekday NY Times puzzle grid  and I can't find any way to resize the grid to show the whole puzzle at once. (You must swipe down or hit an arrow button to reveal the lower one-third of the grid.)  The Across and Down clues appear alongside the grid in a readable typeface  but the clues are cut off at the right.  (Perhaps this is an 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD issue that the developer will correct fortunately  clicking on a cut-off clue will display the full clue below the grid.)  The puzzle hints--found under the list icon beside the app icon  at the left--don't always work as expected.  For example  ""reveal entire puzzle"" only filled in one word (for the 1-down clue) when I started from the ""hints for 1-down"" screen.  In contrast  ""reveal entire puzzle"" filled in the entire puzzle when I started from a ""press-and-hold-on-clue"" popup.  Worse  the general settings for navigation (e.g.  ""skip filled squares""  ""show mistakes"") don't seem to function at all.  (Perhaps this is another Kindle Fire HD issue for the developer to fix.)  The app allows you to enter multiple letters in a single square  and to look up puzzle info (must-haves for NY Times crossword solvers).  If you are a NY Times crosswords subscriber  the app will automatically download the daily puzzles for you.  The app comes with an assortment of puzzles already installed  and allows you to browse for and download many more puzzles from the Internet.  It also allows you to establish an account and compare your times with other solvers.  However  the FREE [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] app does nearly all of the same things.  (Crosswords Plus does not download your NY Times subscription puzzles automatically  although it makes it easy to download them daily it doesn't come with puzzles loaded  although it points you to free Internet sources and it doesn't have a feature for comparing scores with other solvers.)  In addition  [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] allows you to resize the grid  offers an alternate clues-only view  includes the usual hints options  and has navigational settings (skipping boxes  etc.) that are fully functional on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet.  Even if this CROSSWORDS app worked perfectly  I would still prefer [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]].  For this reason  and because of the high price and current Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet issues  I rate CROSSWORDS at 3 stars.",0

eyeshadow,I really hope this service and products improve in my next box!. I recieved 4 items plus a makeup bag with my first month of this subscription. The description of what is supposed to come in each months box clearly stated that there were supposed to be 5 (five) full sized products  consisting of all lip products and one random makeup item. I received a full sized lip liner  a normal sized lipstick and very small  what I would call sample size lip scrub and eyeshadow. They were extremely small. Also  the lipstick was smudge proof  but remained SO sticky the entire time I wore it. I mean  my lips kept sticking together and even stuck to my napkin when I wiped my mouth. I didn't like it. The price is not bad  and I'm going to continue my subscription for a few more months to see if the products improve  but if they remain consistently poor  then the value isn't actually good for the price and I will cancel.,0

access to Facebook required,TOO tight. Up side.... 1.not a lot of ads... except to buy tokens Down side.... 1. SUPER tight payouts...

They bring in new games and then take them away... so far  the really fun games! 4.  A bunch of &#34high roller&#34 games that are ridiculous to play unless you buy millions of tokens  so they are a waste 5.  Even after &#34buying&#34 tokens they STILL don't pay out any better and STILL accost you with ads to buy more tokens. 6.  The worst part is that in order to make an &#34account&#34 so you don't loose you purchased tokens you MUST allow them access to your facebook!!! You would think if you'd purchased tokens you could set up using an email.. I got the msg after trying to set up with my gmail  &#34We are currently not allowing account setups with gmail.&#34  - or any other email. So I guess when I run out of the tokens I bought I will just uninstall. BEWARE of &#34unhelpful&#34 votes as they are likely the seller that doesn't like that you are providing honest reviews.,0
overheat,Great value. A great little cleaner that actually heats the water.  I wish it would run for 15 minutes at a time instead of 5  but the unit would probably overheat.,0
fits great and is slim fitting,Love the color and design on this case. Love the color and design on this case. It fits great and is slim fitting.  I don't care for bulky phone covers.  This one is pretty in design and not bulky.  A perfect combination.  It's also rubbery to help protect the phone ),1
hours of fun,Would make an adorable gift for the child in your life!. What a great little stuffed animal for the little girl in your life. I bought these (Snow Leopard Switch A Rooz as well) for  2 and 5 year old sisters. Hours of fun. The little one never put it down (and I understand is sleeping with the penguin every night). Big hit for a little price. Nice!,1
colorful,Fit deep twin xl  nicely. Soft  warm  colorful  fit an extra deep twin xl  nicely! Would buy again. Keep in mind they are microfiber not traditional cotton sheets.,1
haven't used it much,Good. Seems to work well - haven’t used it much,0
large would have been ideal for me,"Runs a Bit Small. This dress is light and airy. It's perfect for warmer weather. The fabric is thin and has no stretch. There's a tie at the neckline and an elasticized waistband. The dress is fully lined for opacity. I found the fit to run slightly small. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. The large would have been ideal for me.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1

Looks beautiful on house,Good price. Great. Looks beautiful on house. Didn’t come with bulbs. Puts off a pretty shine of light.,1
not labeled well,Great Fit!. This replacement brush heads are a great fit on my Oral B Pro Limited toothbrush. They are way more affordable than the Oral B ones. They work well  too. I am very pleased with them. My only issue is that they're not labeled well in my opinion. They have a code on them which identifies what they are  but that doesn't help unless you know the codes. I want to be able to quickly know which one is the softer  sensitive one VS which on is the deep clean. I think I'm just going to have to look them up and write on the packaging.,0
works just as it should,4k adapter cable. Husband needed for his head phone charger - works just as it should.  I will update my review with any updates should new info seem useful.,1
good flavor,Good beef jerky  excellent lightly spiced  perfect for snacking. Great not-overly-spicy beef jerky. Perfect size for packing in my lunch bag for a mid afternoon snack. This is definitely one of my favorites. I did deduct a star because even though the flavor was great  I did find this pack a little on the dry side. I am going to order another package before month end and if I find the next package to be better  I will be adding to this review and changing it to a 5 star. My brother and nephew really love this jerky  too  and have been eating it for years  so I know it's got to be good!,1
Perfect fit,Perfect fit. All my embroidery supplies fit inside,1
unexpected encounters,Good concept  but implementation falls flat. I bought this game based solely on the description on the box. I expected a game that had a trailing camera with good graphics  interesting combat  and an engaging storyline. I came away disappointed.  The most disappointing aspect of the game is the combat engine. Instead of a realtime hand-to-hand combat system  combat is turn-based. This in itself is not a problem. However  when engaged in combat  the participants run forward  take a swing  and run back. They take turns doing this until someone drops. The whole scenario comes across almost like a game of turn-based bumper cars.  Another issue with combat is the unexpected encounters that occur. In the opening stages of the game  the character must wander about in the woods  and very frequently the travel is interrupted by a message to prepare for combat. Often  that there are enemies nearby is a surprise as they do not show until the battle is joined. This kind of encounter occurs throughout the game.  Combat is often imbalanced as well. It is too easy to die.  The dialog options are somewhat uninspired as well  and the main character frequently talks to herself when trying to interact with inanimate objects. This is disconcerting  if nothing else.  There are good and bad aspects to the graphics. The graphics engine itself is good  and the rendered graphical images are very pretty and inspiring. There is plenty of eye candy in this game for those that like pretty graphics and lots of detail. However  one aspect of the graphics that is frustrating is the changing camera perspective. It switches automatically from a side view to a top-down view depending on area transitions  and in the top-down view it is difficult to tell where the player is going and what is in the surrounding area.  The storyline itself is engaging  and the developer did a nice job with it. Some of the side quests leave much to be desired  though  so it is a mixed bag in terms of gameplay.  If I had to compare it to other games in the same general genre  I would describe it as a hybrid mix between Dungeon Siege and Arcanum. Unfortunately it borrows a little too heavily from Arcanum's pitfalls.  I came away disappointed with this title. It has some good ideas and concepts that have been incorporated into it  but the implementation of those ideas make it less than ideal. Some players may find this game to be a refreshing change from 1st-person style gaming  but I found it to be clunky and awkward. I would recommend this title only to those who want to explore the storyline and are not too concerned about the implementation.,0
skipped a lot,"well ......UPDATE. i just got it but im impressed ""so far""  sounds good  looks good  easy to pair with my Google Mini home ... !  i was impressed until last night when the yellow light turned on the blue light wont come back  i dont have 2  to pair together  dont need them  and now the light wont go out even though i did what the book and manufacturer said  im returning this cuz without the blue light it wont work  !  i also noticed while it was playing yesterday for the short time it worked it skipped alot  of times",0
song list is pretty good,Fun. My family has enjoyed Just Dance games over the years. This one is a little different because it requires the use of a cell phone. While I'm not crazy about that  it does seem to work well. The song list is pretty good  though as with most of the Just Dance games  I only knew about half of the songs. To access all of the songs  you do have to subscribe to something. Long gone are the days when the purchase of the game included access to all of the songs.,1
smell,Softness again!. Made my hair soft again! Not the easiest thing to get on when you have long hair but I managed. Then after the time required I wash my hair and couldn't believe how soft it was. It hasn't been that soft in a long time. So I definitely think it was worth the trouble stuffing all my hair in there and letting it sit plus it doesn't smell the greatest  nor does it smell bad I'm just used to very perfumed shampoos. But I'll definitely be using it again.,0
did nothing,Less sweat  dried feet. I am on the fence about this product.  It states to apply 3 times a day at first.  Who has time for that?  I did apply at least twice a day.  For the first few days  it did nothing.  After repeated use  it started to help decrease the sweating of my feed.  It does state this in the directions.  It dries the feet out  which I guess is the point  but aesthetically speaking  it doesn’t look great.  I want nice looking feet   not over dried looking.  The bottle is pretty small .  It lasted about a month.  I did buy another bottle  so I could really decide whether I liked it or not.  I am still deciding whether to buy another or not.  Don’t like how my feet look when using it  but I like having less sweaty feet.  I am wondering how it would work if just used during exercise  when the sweating is worse.,0
degrades very rapidly,Relative to offerings sadly this is the one to choose. The others are worse.. I'm giving this product three stars  primarily due to the fact it is a knee scooter. And the pad where you put your knee is not very much padding at all in fact it's a willful attempted being a good pad and the covering that covers that is even worse. With very little use my wife having had foot surgery  the pad felt inadequate to begin and degrades very rapidly  and the fake leather whatever the covering is on it is made of is like starting to crack and maybe as durable as a wet paper towel maybe. That's the bad stuff now the good stuff is in terms of mobility and functionality this thing offers quick release adjustment on the handlebars which is far far superior to most of the other brands which you have to take the pin all the way out unscrew it all the way take it all the way out adjust the handlebars and then you have to store it somewhere not very Mobile in my opinion so this one's light years ahead of all of those.  Overall I have to say compared to what else is on the market this thing is a pretty good value for the money but it still leaves a lot to be desired. Having said that it is the one that we finally purchased. Similar to how we vote in the United States  sadly we had to choose between the better piece of garbage.,0
get dropped(or thrown) you'll be surprised and aggravated at the distance these things get when they roll-wow,They work.. These are the newborn pacifiers so they are a bit softer than the ones meant for older babies. I like to attach them to something because when they get dropped(or thrown) you'll be surprised and aggravated at the distance these things get when they roll-wow!!!! So many of them lost  maybe I should switch to the square ones lol,0
most used,Dewalt Max Lithium-Ion 4 tool set. My husband is a project manager.  Uses Dewalt tools every day and for many  many years.  While this kit is NOT the most powerful tools Dewalt offers  he says that they are perfectly fine for home use.  Further he believes that the tool bag is worth it's weight in gold.  It keeps tools readily available and is handy to use in carrying the tools to your project area.  I have to admit most of the men I've seen looking over the tools are ooing and ahing over the actual tool bag.  We purchased this on &#34Prime Sale Day&#34 and my husband believes that we paid a fair sale price.  While it wasn't a &#34steal&#34 it was well worth the money spent.  Everything listed was included... and interestingly the piece that my husband thought he would not use much has turned out to be the most used at this time - the flashlight!  The tools are fairly heavy pieces so I am not sure I will be used them as a girl (ha) but they are certainly doable.  I always update my reviews if new info would be helpful.  Finally  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.,0
little time is given to central theme,A quick read  but a disjointed and lightweight plot. Dead and Gone  the ninth installment in Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire series  is both a curse and a blessing. Let's start with the good news first: the blessing is that it's a quick  breezy read (I finished it in a couple of hours). The curse is that the plot is lightweight  many of the characters are throwaway  and the book reaches a new level of graphic violence on par with HBO's [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]] adaptation.  As I've noted in the most recent Southern Vampire novels  Sookie is starting to show her age. She's currently without a love life she's sworn off Bill after discovering his treachery  she broke off her relationship with weretiger Quinn  and Eric seems to want to claim her for her own (finally  we get some more Eric action!).  In Dead and Gone  Sookie is once again called upon to discover the perpetrator of a gruesome crime when one of her shifter acquaintances is found brutally murdered behind Merlotte's. Like the vampires before them  the Weres have also decided to go mainstream  and this may be the reason behind the death. There's also a secondary plot involving Sookie's fairy connections through her great-grandfather Niall  and of a brewing war between rival fairy factions that threatens Sookie and everyone that she loves.  The main problem with Dead and Gone is that little time is given to what is supposed to be a central theme. Sure  Sookie's fairy heritage has been revealed in bits and pieces over several books  but in Dead and Gone  this plays a central role yet little is revealed about Harris's fairy culture other than the fact that Sookie is constantly in danger. Regarding the level of violence  the bodies pile up with little rhyme or reason characters that have been present in several books are handily dispatched for no apparent reason other than to generate  collateral damage. Several pregnant women are murdered. There are also graphic depictions of crucifixion and torture that may be disturbing to some readers.  The narrative is disjointed and contains numerous errors regarding events in earlier books. The biggest flaw is the lack of interest too much time is spent on the initial murder while the real battle is anticlimactic. The numerous red herrings (Octavia discovering a long-lost flame and moving out  former friend Arlene's betrayal that nearly results in Sookie's demise  Quinn's single appearance  Sookie mentioning her nephew Hunter only twice) only serve to fill pages and do nothing to advance the backstory or the action. Dead and Gone isn't a total loss  but it's not an engrossing read either  more of a beach book that's good for summer afternoons. Yes  it reads quickly  but I felt like precious little had actually occurred in 300 pages. I can only hope that the next installment sees a deeper story and more character development.,0
simplify the filtering,French Press works better. I was so excited to use this for cold brew since I love so many OXO products  but this was a disappointment. I’ve been making cold brew in a French press until now  and I have been pleased with the results  but since it requires hands on filtering  I thought this OXO system would simplify the filtering and allow the machine to do most of the work. Wrong. With a French Press  once the coffee has brewed  I can press the coffee and separate most of the grounds from the cold brew. Then I slowly pour it out into a mesh filter lined with a paper filter and wait for it to slowly seep through. I have to change the paper filter half way through before pouring the second half. With this OXO system  you are supposed to be able to flip the switch and the cold brew will drip down in to the glass carafe below. But the grounds kept clogging the filter and then absolutely no liquid could get through. (I will also note that I have a quality conical burr grinder  so the grind should not be an issue.) I had to stand over it for about 15 min scraping the grounds to the side or scooping spoonfuls of grounds out of the brewing container. After 15 minutes of this  we were left with roughly 2/3 of the volume of cold brew we would have gotten from the same recipe in a French press. The reduced volume was partially due to me scooping grounds out of the way and throwing them in the sink  and partially because there was no way to effectively press the liquid out of the grounds. Also the taste was inferior. Again probably because the most concentrated cold brew couldn’t be pressed out of the grounds. Overall the taste was nowhere as good and the process was more cumbersome than a French press. I wish I loved this machine  but on the plus side  it’s one less thing to sit on my counter and take up more space in the fridge.,0
spreads nicely,Nice. This is good paint  easy to use and spreads nicely. Would buy again.,1
Addictive,Addictive!. A very addictive game! I find words I never would have thought of!,1
keeps paints separate,Better Than Using a Paper Plate!. My daughter enjoys painting in her free time. She uses acrylic paint that comes in little tubes and likes to blend her own colors. I ordered this for her because she was using a paper plate for her paints and this looked like it would be easier to use. It also keeps the paints separate and not touching accidently. It cleans up pretty easily  too.,1
smaller than the step stool and fits nicely in the pantry,"Helpful Around Home. I'm 5'6""  so I'm not short  but our kitchen cabinets are way out of my reach. I hate having to drag the step stool in just to reach things on the top shelf. This tool is very helpful in those situations. And it's much smaller than the step stool and fits nicely in the pantry. I like that you can rotate the part that grips onto items. I also like that you can extend it at an angel is you want. It works pretty well for most items. I have found that the claw part (for lack of the official term) doesn't expand enough to fit around some things. I was trying to reach the container of salt so I could refill the shaker and it barely fit around that. Other than that  I like it.",1
small,Good brightness levels  battery life is really good. clip a bit weak.. After trying/owning other portable  battery-operated lights & lamps  have to say this is my favorite for its reliable output of light and its sturdiness. Its battery life is pretty good too. The only thing I wish were better is the 'clip'. Depending on the surface its attached to  it does not always hold well. It (clip) is small but also rather bulky and not very strong to give good support to the bulkiness of the light.,0
full sized skin care and makeup products,Full & trial sizes premium beauty products. I like this subscription box because it offers full sized skin care and make up products and they are premium beauty products. However  I do not like the fact that the box does not offer very many products it only offers like five or six and I feel like it’s over priced. I suggest the ipsy subscription that offers make up skin care and products for your body and they come in full and trial sizes and that has been a great subscription box for me.,1
large sized bows,Great for Pink Out Game!. Perfect for my daughter and her friends for the Pink Out football game this weekend. They are large sized bows and great for high school girls. The pony tail band is secured with glue and a layer of ribbon to hold it in place. They are sturdy and well made. I would definitely consider ordering more hair bows from this seller in the future.,1
hands protect,Great set of dish washing gloves!. This gloves are perfect for dish washing or other household cleaning duties. They keep your hands protect nicely during all these duties we love so dearly  not. They are a good quality product that should stand up the test of time quite nicely  only time will tell. These gloves come with a cotton flocking that makes wearing them nice and comfortable and absorbs your sweat to some degree. Getting a pair of these for $10 is very good so I can recommend purchasing these for sure!,1
Visa pour les beaux jours,A good introduction to Céline's earlier works. Long before Beauty and the Beast and her first English-language albums  Céline was already a star in her native Québec. She has been recording albums since 1981  and until a few years ago her earliest albums were only  available on records. But 19 songs from 1981-1988 are now available on this  collection  including the rarest  Ce n'était qu'un rêve. Céline's mother  wrote the song for her twelve-year old daughter and it was this song that  joined Céline's destiny with that of her husband and manager René  Angélil.   Many of Céline's early hits are featured here  including  D'amour ou d'amitié and Ne partez pas sans moi. Also included are a number  of B-sides (the rare L'amour viendra  Visa pour les beaux jours  etc.) and  the complete lyrics to each song. Sorry  no translations are given in the  CD booklet.  This is an excellent CD for fans of Céline to become  aquainted with her earlier works en français. It is well worth the price.  Do yourself a favour and buy this CD today!,1
Prices have gone up,They work!. It is always a gamble to assure the fact that they work. Prices have gone up.,0

different fog liquids and still no success,Ahhh. This is a decent fog machine however the fog only lasts for short bursts. I got it for our Halloween setup but the fog looks unintentional (if that makes sense). It would produce the fog  then the fog completely dissipates  then more fog.  If you used this as a set prop in a 12x12 room  it would likely work well. I did try a few different fog liquids and still no success. We ended up borrowing our neighbors and it worked well. Their machine looked similar to ours so I don’t know what occurred.  I think it works ok  just needs to be a very small area.,0
adjust the speed,Loud but effective. This thing works GREAT considering how inexpensive it was. It's quite loud at full power  but you can adjust the speed up and down depending on your needs. Most importantly  it effectively sucks in dust when you file over it  helping to keep down the scattering of nail dust all over yourself  your clothes  your work surface  etc.,1
basic cooking methods and tools,Quick and easy vegetarian recipes that are heavy on processed products. I became vegetarian during grad school. Living in the dorm  I didn't have direct access to a kitchen  either. This necessitated frequent trips to the local co-op / organic store. Student's Vegetarian Cookbook for Dummies is perfect for this scenario: busy student  not much time (or space) to cook. Many of the included recipes take five or less minutes to throw together.  The first 85 pages or so are dedicated to understanding reasons for a vegetarian diet  living the vegetarian lifestyle  and basic cooking methods and tools. If you have a basic knowledge of cooking  that is more than enough  since most of time these recipes simply involve unwrapping and microwaving. The instructions were so simple that this would be an appropriate book for teens (it's literally things like how to assemble a sandwich or veggie burger). I was also put off by the fact that so many of the ingredients are heavily processed (soy meats  vegetarian gravy  Pasta Roni seasoning packets).  The biggest issue for me was that so little of the included recipes sounded remotely appetizing. There is nutritional info provided many of the suppers relied extensively on potatoes and pasta and had calorie and fat counts that were rather high (600+ calories for the smothered potatoes  538 calories for the Athena's Potatoes  646 calories and 39 g fat for the Blue Cheese Fettuccine). That's not to say that healthier vegetarian options aren't present many of the five-minute lunches have much lower calorie counts and rely on whole grains  veggies  cottage cheese  hummus  and beans  but if you ate the included supper ideas on a regular basis  it could easily pack on the weight.  Overall  this would be a good first book for those who are new to the kitchen the included recipes are so simple that you'll want to move to something a little more challenging  like [[ASIN:0767927478 Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone]] or [[ASIN:0764524836 How to Cook Everything Vegetarian: Simple Meatless Recipes for Great Food]]. Personally  I prefer [[ASIN:1557884382 The PDQ (Pretty Darn Quick) Vegetarian Cookbook: 240 Healthy and Easy No-Prep Recipes for Busy Cooks]] and [[ASIN:0399535616 Supermarket Vegan: 225 Meat-Free  Egg-Free  Dairy-Free Recipes for Real People in the Real World]] as my go-to for quick  simple  and satisfying vegetarian / vegan food.,1
programming is just so random,Beach Boys' Sounds of Summer Redux. The sound is uniformly fabulous.  The hits (99% of them  anyway) are all here.  The 80 (!) tracks spread over three discs have never sounded better  truly.  Following on the heels of the fantastic Feel Flows box set though  there's a certain bump in the road here.  The trouble is the programming it's just so random.  Spanning the Boys' 60-year-career  it would have made a lot more sense (to me  anyway) to program the sets in chronological order according to release  whether by each individual disc or start-to-finish across all three discs.  A minor complaint  I admit  but annoying enough to me that I can't give it the full tilt boogie I'd like to.  Four classic Hobie surfboards and definitely recommended to fans of the band.,0

only get ONE piece,You get ONE PIECE. Important to realize. Well  I am not sure why someone would want this particular hair piece. It is ok  and the hair feels very slick. But you only get ONE piece  so it would not be enough for most hairstyles.  I misplaced my photos  but will add them when I find them. It is just super important to realize you do not get a whole hairpiece  but just one small clip's worth of hair. To look like the vendor photo  you would need to buy 10-12 of these.,0

decent cast,Poorly done (decent cast  poor plot  erratic story line and not very nice characters). Truly poor - shallow  poorly developed & unlikeable characters who didn’t seem to even like each other.  A bride who showed zero concern for her missing groom-to-be throughout the entire movie.  Poor script  weak plot and over-the-top acting.  This is drivel & a waste of time to watch.  I've read many 'cosy mysteries' and this movie tries to bring one to the screen  but the entire plot is poorly developed and the characters are unreal.  For example  one character goes from making love to her old boyfriend who soon afterwards pushes her off a cliff allegedly because she had previously broken up their relationship.  Not even soap opera good.,0

substantive work,Very Enjoyable Period Mystery about Female Botany Graduate Studen. In this delightful debut  A Botanist's Guide to Parties and Poisons introduces us to Saffron Everleigh  the only female working in the University College London Biology Department.  She is the assistant to Professor Maxwell  a botanist. He is an old family friend  who assigns Saffron substantive work and mentors her  an unusual experience for many assistants and exceptional for a woman in this position. Five years ago  Saffron's father  also a botanist  died in WWI. The novel opens in the roaring Twenties. The University has recently secured funding for an interdisciplinary South American expedition.  While Professor Maxwell was not included on the team  Saffron is assisting him in preparing the documentation necessary for a research project to be conducted on his behalf. The book opens with a party to celebrate the upcoming six-month expedition. Dr. Henry  a history professor who will lead the expedition and well-known philanderer is there with his long-suffering wife. Saffron chats up various people  with mixed success. She decides to take her leave  feeling rather invisible as the only female scientist at the party and serving on the lowest rung of professional staff. She happens upon Mr. Ashton  a young biologist as she is heading down a hallway to make her farewells. As they chat  the two inadvertently overhear Mrs. Henry having a highly personal conversation with their hostess. When she makes her way to the room where the party has gathered  Saffron finds celebratory speeches underway. She approaches her hosts to thank them just when another round of champagne is being poured.  Very near Saffron  Mrs. Henry takes one sip of champagne and collapses  to be carried away by ambulance in grave condition. Khavari does a lovely job establishing Saffron as a curious and competent investigator  working to point out poison related information to the police investigating Mrs. Henry's apparent poisoning checking out a decent array of suspects pulling in others to help with her dangerous enquiries giving us a nice feel for several years post-war London life and academia throwing in a possible romance and keeping it light enough to be a cozy and accurate enough to be a pleasing historical fiction piece. The clues are there  not too clear cut  the red herrings are decent and the setting is well wrought. This one is a win for me!  I will definitely look for the next Sapphron Everleigh installment  with pleasure.,1

durable and long lasting,Light Weight. We love to decorate for Halloween. This skeleton will be a fun addition to our yard display this season. He does require some assembly. It's easy though and just a matter of sliding a piece or two into place. He's very light weight. He has a sturdy rope attached to him for hanging. And since it's light weight  I don't expect any problems with him weighing down a branch or whatever we use to hang him on. He is a good size. He's a short adult size. His arms are easy to pose. I'm not convinced that he's very durable and long lasting  but I feel confident that he should last a few Halloweens.,0

Purchased as a Christmas gift some years ago for my younger sister  our extended family's biggest Elvis fan.  She loved the Elvis musicals growing up (especially It Happened at the World's Fair  Viva Las Vegas  Roustabout  and Girl Happy)  and tuned them in anytime they were being shown on television.  She had collected most of the soundtrack LPs (or 8-tracks  or cassettes) but hadn't gone the CD replacement route  except for her favorites in the Double Feature series.  So  here we are  Elvis for Christmas one more time.  Needless to say  she was / is thrilled with the boxset  absolutely loves it keeps it on prominent display on a special Elvis shelf in her music room.  And she regularly keeps the discs in heavy rotation.  The full five-star rating and highly recommended for the true Elvis fanatics in your life.,1
not big enough to fit 2 of them in crossfire,A good case for the price. A good case for the price. I was nervous that it would not be roomy enough to fit my Sapphire R9 280X GPU  but it did. However  it is not big enough to fit 2 of them in crossfire  so when that day comes  this case will no longer suit my needs. Otherwise  it is everything I need in a case.,0
cool feature when the cart is closed and the wheels are folded up,This cart will absolutely exceed your expectations!. This cart exceeded my expectations by 200% even at the $169 price tag.  It is designed to work hard and not break.  It’s built like a tank  I have no doubt about the 400 lb load rating. The larger wheels easily go up/down stairs and curbs.  I expect this cart to last a very long time.  One cool feature is that when the cart is closed and the wheels are folded up  if you hold it vertically  the wheels are slightly below the platform and roll.  This comes in handy if you don’t have any cargo and you’re have limited access  you can close the cart and roll it instead of carrying it.  You won’t be disappointed with this cart!,1
fights are much easier,A lovely little piece of nostalgia!. As a kid I remember playing Pokémon Red on my Game Boy and Pokemon Yellow on my Game Boy Color and have so many fond memories of it.  Now  as a 31 year old man  I bought this game with my Switch to try to relive some of those moments and enjoy the nostalgia.  I haven’t played any Pokémon games since Pokemon Yellow so playing this game was a real treat!  This game was really fun! I don’t regret buying it. But having said that it does have some flaws. Firstly: This Pokémon game was ALOT easier than the older Red  Blue and Yellow ones. I was able to collect all 8 badges in 10 hours of playtime  a lot of that time I wasn’t even playing and just left the game on and a lot more of it was spent in the constant cut scenes. It seems like just when I feel like I’m really getting going Sonia  or especially  Hop interfere and want to have long conversations or  for Hop  to duel me. It’s pretty annoying. Not only that but the fights are much easier. I got through every gym and got all 8 badges without losing a single battle. I didn’t even bother looking for more powerful Pokémon because the first 6 I got were fine and able to beat anyone I came across.  Having said that  this game is great for children! It’s not too hard where they’ll get frustrated  but it’s not too easy for children either. Each gym battle (except one) is fought in a huge arena and it feels great to hear the crowd cheering you on. The music is upbeat and really got me in the mood to kick butt. Each badge earned comes with a sense of accomplishment which is great.  All in all I do recommend this game for children or for adults who played the older games and just want some nostalgia.,1
work great so far,USB C cords. If you just purchased the latest gen of android cell phone (for me  the Samsung S10+) you will need a new type of charging cords... they do charge on the cord free units - but if you're away from those  you will need these cords.  There is also a micro usb to usb C adapter - will save you a few bucks - but eventually you'll want new cords. These work great so far - however  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
many pockets,Would buy again. Finally a large bag that holds everything! With my first I got a cute backpack diaper bag which was great but when another baby came along there was NOT room! Looked around a while and found this. Wish they had more designs because I’m not really a polka dot fan but whatever  it definitely gets the job done. Multiple ways to carry and easy for husband to wear too. He’s a big dude and can fit this on easily. So many pockets and love the fold out diaper change part which has saved us in some questionable changing areas.,1
cute,Cute and Comfortable!. First  the picture of this doesn't look like the actual bra. If you look at the other pictures in the description  it shows the real one. It's all one color of brown. The picture shown makes it look like it has two distinctly different colors. I would say it's true to size. While it is a full coverage bra  it's very thin so I can't wear it under just anything. The lace will show through lighter  form fitting fabrics. When wearing form fitting shirts  I really have to wear t-shirt bras or molded cups  for nipple coverage as well. It's a comfortable enough bra to wear all day long. It's cute  too!,1
letting go will stop the water flow instantly,Pressure trigger is more convenient.. I need this for my new bidet attachment for my toilet.  The original requires difficult finger manipulation to turn on and off the water flow.  With this trigger  letting go will stop the water flow instantly.  Much more convenient.,1
amazing customer service,Amazing customer service and cats are obsessed.. I recommend the “without treats” subscription as you get an extra toy. So far my cats are obsessed with at least one toy from each box we’ve received. The others are still appreciated. They're always based around a cool theme and there is one wand toy included each month. At least a couple are manufactured in the US (maybe handmade?). They seem pretty high-quality overall. I’ve gotten two boxes so far and love that meowbox offers a bimonthly subscription through the website. Meowbox also has amazing customer service.,1
USB ports,plug extender with shelf. This is really great.  I use the shelf for my cup dispenser and my sonic toothbrush.  I have WAY more plug in options than I need... a bunch of plug ins INCLUDING USB ports!  Further  there is a night light.  It points directly at my toilet cubby so it's about perfect.  It plugged right into the wall plug and is VERY stable even without the screw (I put into a GFI  so I couldn't use the center screw).  The only negative I have to report is that the plugins are all toward the front.  I wish there was a side plug in so that the plug head of my toothbrush didn't stick straight out... Eh.  That's a small complaint  I couldn't ding a star for that cause it's kinda a personal thing.  The shelf has little grooves that was SUPER easy to slide the shelf right on.  The unit is bright white (works perfectly in my white bathroom).  To be honest  I didn't think I was gonna love this as much as I do.  Having said all that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
material feels and looks,"print dress with pockets. I am 5'8""... 38DDD... usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  I purchased the black floral print.  First  the obvious... the sizing is WAY off.  Super too small.  If you have a chest at all - pass.  The elastic waist fits like an empire waist... the pockets are way too high (because it's too small) and oddly  the print material has a slight sheen to it... unlike the other photos I saw of the non-print.  It's heavy feeling and in weight.  The tag notes 95% Rayon 5% Spandex.  - feels like it.  There is some stretch - but the sleeves were uncomfortably snug - and way too snug across the chest.  The tag notes machine wash - but no dryer - hand dry and light iron if necessary.  Made in China.  Honestly  if you're a women of curves - as I am  I would NOT recommend this even in the 2x - it's just too small.  It's disappointing that the sizing is so off.  But having said that - I am not really a fan of the way the material feels and looks.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful  however  I am donating this dress - so there's not much more to say.  Hope this info helps you.",0
cider-glazed apple-walnut cake,Make showstopping desserts on your countertop with minimal effort!. I’m a fairly recent convert to the slow cooker bandwagon I only purchased my first slow cooker a couple of years ago and started out by baking my way through all the desserts in Michele Scicolone’s excellent “The Mediterranean Slow Cooker ” which introduced me to the joys of making flan  cheesecake  and fruit compote in the slow cooker.  Fast forward several years later and I was looking to expand my slow cooker desserts repertoire  so imagine my delight when I got an e-mail from Lisa Ekus that highlighted “Slow Cooker Desserts” by Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore! Roxanne and Kathy are cookbook authors  food consultants  cooking teachers and food bloggers who have written seven cookbooks and a popular blog  www.pluggedintocooking.com.  As soon as my copy of “Slow Cooker Desserts” arrived  I couldn’t wait to dig in to the many inviting recipes covering not only cakes and cheesecakes  but also bread puddings  fruits  and candy and fondues. The book opens with a good compact guide to slow cookers  bakeware  and ingredients. The layout is uncluttered and straightforward  and each recipe is followed by helpful tips  making it perfect for novice bakers. The gorgeous photography by Jennifer Davick deserves a special mention as well.  The first recipe I tried was the Praline-Pumpkin Cheesecake. I decided to substitute a gingersnap crust for the graham crackers  and it added the perfect touch of spice to complement the spices in the cheesecake filling. Note that you do need to blind bake the gingersnap crust prior to baking in the slow cooker  but this only adds a few minutes to the prep time. Also  perhaps it was the brand of gingersnaps I used  but I would recommend adding a little extra melted butter until the crust comes together – the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter for ½ cup crumbs. One thing I would suggest is to also liberally spray the sides of your springform pan as well – mine is supposedly nonstick  but I followed the recipe (which only specifies to spray the bottom of the pan) and a large portion of my cheesecake edges stuck and broke. I normally do spray the entire pan with Baker’s Joy  but I follow the recipes as written when I am testing for reviews.  The finished cheesecake texture is very fluffy and a bit crumbly  so I did have difficulty cutting it neatly I’m not sure if I may have beat TOO much air into my filling and will beat for less next time. The praline topping (made in the microwave in under three minutes) is destined to become my new secret weapon in the kitchen! This homemade caramel was delicious and deceptively easy and would also make a great addition to ice cream or cakes. All combined (gingersnap crust  spiced pumpkin filling  praline topping)  this is a great fall dessert with minimal effort and also frees up your oven for other baking tasks.  The second recipe I tried was the candied cranberry and crystallized ginger chutney this one called my name because I am a certified fiend when it comes to candied ginger. I had a bag of organic cranberries in the freezer that I was looking to use up  so it worked out perfectly that I already had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry (even the ginger liqueur!). My bag of organic cranberries was slightly smaller than the 16-oz. bag called for in the recipe  so I scaled back on the sugar quite a bit as I was using candied ginger (I used ¾ cup sugar in place of the 1 ¼ in the recipe  and it was plenty sweet for me). It also had the bonus of making my kitchen smell amazing as it cooked! I cooked mine down for a little longer the recipe says that it should be thin  but I like my chutney on the very thick side more like a compote. The recipe calls for between 5 to 7 hours on low and I ended up cooking mine for 3 hours on high due to time. This would be fantastic stirred into yogurt  as an accompaniment to Indian food  or even as a side dish in place of jellied cranberries or cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.  The third recipe was the chocolate cashew clusters. I’d seen slow cooker candy (including nut clusters) pop up in my Facebook feed  but I’d never tried making it before. The recipe uses salted cashews  semisweet and milk chocolate chips  a dark chocolate candy bar  and candy coating to create decadent nut clusters that look like they came from a candy shop. These take about 1 ½ hours on low plus cooling / set time (3 to 5 hours).  Other recipes on my to-make list from “Slow Cooker Desserts” include the cinnamon-calvados applesauce  rice pudding with cherries  and many of the cheesecakes (brownie chunk  German chocolate  ginger-peach  coconut cream) and cakes (cider-glazed apple-walnut cake  Southern sweet potato cake  pineapple butter cake). There is enough variety and possible variations (I need to find a way to make a cookie butter cheesecake!) to keep you happily baking for months to come.  (Thank you to Lisa Ekus for the review copy!),1
smells amazing,Great Idea and works Amazingly. This is so awesome....wish I would of found it earlier.  I have recommended it to all my friends.  Just two pumps and I rub it into his fur.  It smells amazing and makes his coat shiny and he seems to itch less too....a great solution for in-between baths....love it,1
remote control capability,Super projecting lights for all party uses! Amazingly good!. This is a super cool product. I live in a new 'cool' 55 and older community in the Daytona Beach area and we have parties at neighbor homes several times a week. When I first set these up I wasn't sure what to expect. But after seeing the  variety of lights  patterns and speeds I knew this would be a hit. We had a Motown party last weekend and this projector was the highlight of the night! Great colors  great remote control capability and even responds to voice commands. This would be a great addition to any home (young or old) for use when there is a party to be had. I definitely highly recommend this gadget for all ages and holidays!,1
Maire Brennan,"5 stars alone for including Brian Kennedy's magnificent ""Carrickfergus""!!. I am an all-out Brian Kennedy fanatic. Brian who  you ask? Brian Kennedy  Belfast-born singer with a voice of spun gold  was Van Morrison's back up singer for several years  recorded the *original* You Raise Me Up (NOT Josh Groban)  starred in hundreds of Riverdance on Broadway shows  and for all of that  he's unheard-of in the US. Celtic Circle 2 includes Brian's soul-wrenching rendition of ""Carrickfergus "" a beautiful song of lament  accompanied only by Brian's less-is-more acoustic guitar. Haunting.  Besides the wonderful gift of Brian Kennedy  Celtic Circle 2 builds on the solid combination of modern Celtic music and Irish-influenced New Age that was so successful on Vol. 1. This time around  we have two discs of the Chieftains (the timeless ""Love Theme from Barry Lyndon"" and ""The Foggy Dew"" with Sinead O'Connor)  Clannad (Caislean Oir  Newgrange  Almost Seems)  Maire Brennan  Irish-American powerhouse Cherish The Ladies  Aine Minogue  Nightnoise  fabulous Irish bagpiper Davy Spillane  James Galway  and the stellar team of Susan McKeown and Natalie Merchant on ""River."" Sarah McLachlan even makes an early appearance with Celtic-inspired ""Drawn To The Rhythm."" My only lament is that Loreena McKennitt wasn't featured Ms. McKennitt's early works were classical Celtic-influenced melodies set to famous poems  accompanied by harp.  It's a much-welcome breath of fresh air to see Celtic and New Age done so well  as BMG has consistently shown on its ""Celtic Circle"" releases. So many ""Celtic"" releases are in fact substandard New Age treacle with anonymous vocals and synth instruments  but here we have 30 outstanding tracks that capture the lyric  melancholy beauty of the Irish nature  recorded by masters of the trade (the Chieftains have been around for more than three decades!). Yes  there are New Age pieces  too  tracks from Lord of the Rings and Titanic  but there is a much more balanced look at modern Celtic on Celtic Circle 2 than on the first (more Celtic  less New Age).  Perfect music for relaxing to at the end of a long day -- light a few candles  close your eyes  and let the soothing Celtic melodies inspire and refresh your weary spirit.",1
defeats both it being pretty,Really like these. So why 4 stars?  I read the review  measured it out and decided for the large instead of the next larger choice  because I really have some thick hair.  They are so pretty  and they even gave me an extra stick. I love using them however I can't use them as I did when I was younger (yes in the 70's).  I can't get the barrette around my hair - I have to use a band first - which defeats both it being pretty and it's use to begin with.  I can attach it  but not around 'all' of my hair.  So I should have ordered the larger ones  because I was trying to omit the band altogether as they give my headaches which is why I used them back in the day.  So I eventually cut my hair length and now use these just to tack the front hair back.  If you have really thick hair  buy the larger size!,0
like the 'brown paper' look,sticker tags. These are very nice.  Better than expected.  They pull off nicely and stay on.  I like the 'brown paper' look.  Work perfectly for my use.  Would buy again.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - nearly 6 000 reviews posted  viewed over 50 000 times  and over 24 000 likes.,1
Orcs,Enjoyed!. Fascinating story! Dragons  elves  Orcs  evil kings  frogs.......wonder what's next. Looking forward to the next part with anticipation! Well done  IMO!,1
not machine washable,waterproof vinyl tablecloth. these are fair quality plastic table cloths  the best thing is the elastic edge all around the table  fits like a fitted sheet.  You'll need to smooth for a good fit  just like you do a fitted sheet. I am disappointed that they are not machine washable. They have a really crappy felt like material on the underside so if you did try to machine wash they would just become a ball. So  you do have to wipe them down and thoroughly dry for storage.  They are not super quality so you may get 2 or 3 uses if you are careful not to tear.  So for the price  maybe that is good enough.  I purchased 4  - and having said that I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,0

sizing issue,Not small enough for me.... Sadly  I have super tiny hands  and that makes it incredibly difficult to find proper motorcycle gloves that fit and offer good protection. I got a pair of XS gloves and they were still too big. However  they are the closest I've come to fitting me properly from any gloves I've gotten  so I will give a star for that. The palms are fine  but the fingertips are way too long.  Sizing apart  the quality of the gloves are no better than you'd expect from cheap gloves. Sadly due to the sizing issue  it's hard to find the right size in any quality so I try to make due with what I can get. The knuckles are hardened  but not with that hard rubberized material other high quality gloves have. The rest of the glove is rather thin but flexible. While it's nice to have that extra mobility  I wouldn't trust these in a high speed fall. These would fall apart. For driving around town  these should be more than enough. And with the touch phone fingertips  it can be pretty convenient when quickly checking something on your phone.  These are the gloves I'm using now  and so far with light use  they have been holding up just fine. I'll update if anything comes up over time.,0
convenient,Very convenient. Very convenient,1
historical fiction,A Book That Stirs Memories.... Occasionally I finish a book that leaves me not wanting begin another  at least for a little while  because it really stays with me .I did not want to ruin the stirring feelings I had upon completing Nine  Ten. (This is out of the ordinary for me  as I normally start on another book the minute I finish one.)  It took me back to Before...My boys were four and two...and I remembered how different America was when they were small on September 10th...before.   Nine  Ten reminded me of what it's like to read historical fiction  good historical fiction  about the Titanic. When an author does as wonderful a job writing about a major event as Baskin does  you do not want to stop reading  even though you know what's coming. Even the author notes and  the acknowledgements  were heart- rending.   I have already recommended Nine  Ten to several people. I think this book would be a wonderful way to teach others about 9-11.It will probably be a nostalgia trip for parents of today  most of whom will remember Before...and how it was so different.,1
no need for multiple adapters,Great power adapter to work (almost) anywhere!. Compact travel adapter  nice to carry with you on your journeys. I travel quite often to European countries and this adapter will work in every country I will be visiting. No need to have a more clunky model or multiple adapters in your house  this unit will work in over 100 countries. Highly recommend as a way to ease your travel  just keep it in your suitcase at all times so you always have it with you.,1
batteries are required,Hours of Fun!. This V-Tech Marble Rush Ultimate Set provides hours of fun! Younger kids may need some help setting it up  but many kids will be able to do it on their own. Set up does take a little bit of time  but the pieces fit well together and it's not frustrating. Batteries are required. It comes with batteries for demo purposes  but it's recommended that they are replaced. We've been playing with it for a several days now without any problems on the original batteries. Suggested age for this is 4+. I think there is a wide spread of ages that would enjoy this.,0
nice product,Good delivery. Very nice product and nice gift,1
well made,This fits my husband's macbook very well. It's a .... This fits my husband's macbook very well. It's a snug and safe feeling fit.  It has enough cushion to protect the laptop.  It also has pockets on the outside to hold the charger and other small items.  Well made.,1
difficult to adjust on the fly,Almost impossible to fine tune on the fly.. The forward bolt is to close to the stem. It make it difficult to adjust on the fly. You can barley get a very basic wrench in there. So if your a set it and forget it person  then get this. But if you need to adjust it even a few times a week  don't get it.,0
small amounts of seeds,MOSTLY PEANUTS. This product is mostly peanuts. The small birds will not eat the peanuts. I have mostly sparrows and I came outside to find the small amounts of seeds  in the mixture  all gone. The peanuts were still in the feeder. Birds did not eat. I was surprised as I thought birds would eat anything. But they will not eat these huge peanuts. I would not recommend this product for smaller birds. I can buy a bag of peanuts for a lot cheaper  if I did not want the birds to eat them.,0

the outer is bright white plastic,"led push lights. Using these in our ceramic pumpkins... they are bright and perfect with the remote.  Came with 6 lights and 2 remotes.  Each light takes 3 AAA batteries which are NOT included.  The remotes do have batteries.  You can turn the lights on  off or choose a timer.  They are perfect for our use.  They include self stick circular tabs  for use if you want to ""stick"" them somewhere.  You can also ""press"" the center of the light (which does stick up a bit) to turn on/off.  Each light is about 3"" in circumference.  The outer is bright white plastic.  I think these were a good value.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.  And I hope my review was helpful to you!",1
few foods,"just ""ok"". First.. this app is free... So I will keep it at 3 stars... it's just that there is so very few foods on it...  Wishing and hoping for a much more involved list.

STEM concept,Enjoying this!. We are really enjoying this so far. We've been in the club since Sept 2018 now for our five year old..  We have got  so far  the Cars car you put together (Lightning McQueen) which was a bit hard for him to do - he needed adult help.  The talking microscope is good although unless there are more slides it has a limited span of play.  I did cancel one month because the item had bad reviews  so I didn't want to try it - it was a gardening one.  Then Dec was a National Geographic crystal growing kit - which looks like it will be fun. We haven't done it yet. (Great deal as its normally $40 and we paid stem price of $19.99.)  I like being a part of this as it is always choosing things not on my radar at all - and I appreciate that. I love the whole STEM concept too  being so educational.  We will be continuing and recommend!,1
I wish the mute and volume were on the cable instead the headset.,Nice value gaming headset.. Pros: Fit will over my ears. Good clean sound. Mic works well and does not pick up background noise. Nice design  they remind me flying headphones. Comes with volume and mute controls. Comes with audio adapters for PC or mobile device.  Cons: Only con so far is I wish the mute and volume were on the cable instead the headset.,0
extending base to the mouse,A Lot of Mouse. I have never used a gaming mouse before. Actually I've looked down on people who did for the same reason I don't like some players being on steroids in major league sports. But now that I'm getting older  my reactions are slower  my fingers are not as quick on the keys and...Oh...I guess I like it for exactly the same reasons athletes love steroids...  But on a serious note.  Mousing and key gnashing do take a toll. I don't know that this mouse is a complete solution to it. But I have had relief of being able to have some things macroed to a single mouse button.  If nothing else  it has created a different movement.  I like the quality of the mouse.  The tracking is very good  the feel is okay  the looks are richly industrial.  I'm not huge on the extending base to the mouse.  I just wish it had been a little bigger to fit my hand  but it fits fine without extending. Personally  a little heavier would feel a little better as well.  All in all I'm very impressed  and wished I had given into &#34juicing&#34 my game a long time ago.,0

cardamom,Sugar and spice and everything nice!. Samantha Seneviratne’s “The New Sugar and Spice” takes classic comfort bakes like cinnamon rolls  cookies  breads and cheesecake and reinvents them  using seductive hits of spice in creative and crowd-pleasing ways. In the introduction  the author points out that “the flood of sugar has diluted real flavor  muffled complexity  and concealed true richness ” so her goal was to create delicious  healthier desserts that use spices in a starring role in place of the overwhelming sweetness so prevalent in many desserts.  Chapters are divided by spices (sometimes with complementary pairings)  including peppercorn and chile  cinnamon  nutmeg  clove and cardamom  ginger  and savory herbs and spices. Along the way  Samantha includes stories about her family’s roots and how her Sri Lankan heritage influenced her culinary style  along with fascinating historical insights and storage tips on the various featured spices.  Cinnamon  hazelnut and date buns  ricotta cheesecake with bourbon-raisin jam  orange and honey baklava  orange-clove pull-apart bread  and saffron currant braid were all recipes that instantly called my name. Several years ago  I became hooked on Scandinavian baking and now tend to use cardamom liberally in yeast rolls and sweet breads (even in my morning coffee)  so naturally I was thrilled to see a whole chapter starring my favorite spice!  Measurements are given in both volume and weight (which I appreciate as I find weight measurements to be more reliable). Samantha’s guidance is spot-on there are helpful hints both for new bakers as well as experienced ones to guarantee the best results  particularly for recipes involving yeast. Gorgeous photography by Erin Kunkel highlights various ingredients and finished bakes for maximum (mouth-watering!) impact.  In addition to familiar treats  you’ll find updated versions of international classics such as profiteroles  clafoutis and tarte tatin  Scandinavian bakes like saffron currant braids and cardamom-laced shortbread  Thai banana fritters  Indonesian kue lapis  Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars that are perfect for fall  and other fragrant  delightful baked goods that spiced up my rather predictable baking repertoire. As an experienced home baker  I appreciated the challenge and loved the complexity that the various spices gave to my baked goods and will certainly be baking my way through “The New Sugar and Spice in the near future!  (I received my copy through Blogging for Books),0
familiar favorites,"A handy  well-designed collection of both baking classics and new favorites. I have about 50 baking books ranging the gamut from heritage recipes like [[ASIN:1579125883 Heirloom Baking with the Brass Sisters: More than 100 Years of Recipes Discovered from Family Cookbooks  Original Journals  Scraps of Paper  and Grandmother's Kitchen]] to regional baking of Italy  France  Turkey  and Mexico. When I saw the Taste of Home Baking book  I jumped at the chance to review it.  The recipes come in a sturdy three-ring binder with a removable plastic splashguard. I loved the idea of the splashguard  although I would have liked to see a notes section at the back. The inside covers contain a handy list of food equivalents and ingredient substitutions  and the primer on baking basics is illustrated with numerous color photos.  Index:  Cookies Cakes Bars Cupcakes Cheesecakes Pies and tarts Desserts Quick Breads Muffins  Biscuits  and Scones Yeast Breads Yeast Rolls Coffee Cakes and Sweet Rolls Almost Homemade Trimmed-Down Favorites Holiday Classics  Each recipe has a short comment or introduction by its author  along with the author's name and hometown. The recipe ingredients are printed in an easy-to-read bold font  and steps are clearly numbered. There is no nutritional info provided.  You'll find plenty of familiar favorites here  along with some new and intriguing combinations. For years  our family made snowballs  a nut-and-butter cookie with a hidden Hershey's Kiss in the center. I found an instant new favorite in the chocolate macadamia meltaways a similar idea  except that you make chocolate-and-macadamia centers  chill them  then wrap the macadamia butter dough around them and bake.  For those who have always wanted to try working with yeast  but found it intimidating  this is the perfect guide to demystify the process. There are several chapters on yeast breads  yeast rolls  and sweet rolls  and each chapter opens with a sidebar containing helpful hints. There is a whole page of color photos with step-by-step illustrations of kneading  shaping  and baking yeast bread  tips and troubleshooting for baking in bread machines  how to shape bagels  pretzels  cloverleaf rolls  and more.

picks right up where the series left off,downton abbey the movie. If you are/were a fan of the series  you will LOVE this movie.  Picks right up where the series left off.  Everything you would hope... except one... you'll be sad when it's over.  WAH!!  It's just a story you want to go on and on...  Make a nice cup of tea with a tasty biscuit and enjoy the movie.,1
process of shipping was too hard,It wasn't worth it !!. Well it was worth a shot ! But I gotta pass cause as you can see from beginning to end the last photo its not looking good   my plant arrived in bad shape and the driver left the box upside down ( no way to tell which end was up ) after getting it planted I was hoping it would make it 😬but its dieing 😭slowly its going the process of shipping was just to hard for it so I wont be continuing my Subscription 😞 2 leafs left barely hanging on !! I really think the care given to the plant during shipping was crap ! Maybe a brighter box like orange or red with a warning or fragile ! For shippers to take notice idk but the box was just thrown around like all the rest ! The box was dented   you could see it was not handled well ! So try the service if you want but thats my story 🙏🌿🌱🌵🍀🙏,0
well-known European dishes,Beautiful cookbook  but aimed more at the novice cook. Naturally I'm familiar with Mary Berry from her role as host on the Great British Bake-Off (I've followed the careers of several of the alumni including Edd Kimber  Ruby Tanoh  and Nadiya Hussein)  but this was the first time I'd had the chance to peruse one of her many cookbooks. A legend in British culinary circles  Mary has published more than 75 cookbooks.  In &#34Cooking with Mary Berry &#34 she presents beautifully photographed dishes that lean towards the basic (pizza tartlets  nachos  hummus)  with a dash of well-known European dishes (coq au vin  chicken cordon bleu  boeuf bourguignon  mushroom stroganoff) and quite a few international influences in the form of Mexican / Tex-Mex (mole  shrimp tacos)  Asian  and even Indian and Middle Eastern (including vegetarian dishes such as falafel).  As Mary states in the introduction  her recipes have to meet three criteria: look good  taste good  and be practical to make. Her step-by-step technique photographs would be tremendously helpful for those new to the kitchen  and the limited number of ingredients make this a perfect cookbook for a student going off to college  for example. More experienced chefs will already know all of these tips and tricks  but it's nice to have a reminder from time to time! Some of the vegetarian dishes and sides appealed to me  although the recipes not surprisingly feature meat and seafood quite heavily. I'm also interested in trying Mary's breads and baked goods as that is what she is primarily known for.  This would make a great gift for a budding chef in your life  or if you have basic cooking skills and are interested in trying more adventurous international dishes.,1
very thin,"Nice. I bought these because I loved the pattern and they look great on my table  but they are very thin. Good thing I'm just using them for the '""look"".",0
goes on purple,Dries Clear. I work in a special education classroom and we use glue sticks regularly with our class work. I compared this extra strength glue stick to our regular ones. It's a larger tube than the others  but I really didn't notice any difference in the glue capabilities. It's a good glue stick. It goes on purple and dries clear. It will probably remain my go-to glue stick brand.,1
Louie Armstrong,a musical train wreck. Connie Francis! Herman's Hermits! Liberache! Louie Armstrong! Probably the most incredible mish-mash of musical talent ever assembled in one movie. It makes you wish it was available on DVD. The music is actually quite good  very fun and listenable  a great slice of americana  some really nice standards mixed in with some really horrible train wrecks  it is very much worth the listen just for the kitch value.,1
reduces swelling,Comfortable  “barely there” bandeau perfect for light post-surgery compression stitching poor. I tried this in a large to extra  extra  extra large and all the sizes in-between and these bras fit me perfectly in any of those sizes without much difference in feel or tightness. I got these to help reduce swelling after surgery and this is working perfectly for me. I also love the lilac color. Unfortunately  this one arrived with very poor side stitching. It looks like someone sewed the sides by hand as can be seen from the photo. Other than this  they are the same as every other one I ordered.  Note that they wash well in a lingerie bag but I lay them flat to dry.,1
brighter box like orange or red,It wasn't worth it !!. Well it was worth a shot !

flowers were beige,Very Nice!. These are wonderful! The ONLY issue I had was the flowers that came with it were beige and I needed white and I did not like that the flowers that came with this had long stems that looked awkward inside the mason jar so I used my own white  silk flowers and opted out of attaching the stems and wound the light string through the petals/base of my flowers to hold it secure to the top of the jar and this made more space for the lights and I’m satisfied with the way they look. These are well made and very easy to assemble. Would highly recommend!!,0
easy to take gummy,Great multivitamin  everything my grandson needs in a terrifc tasting gummy!. My 6 year old grandson loves taking his vitamins this way! Not only are they dinosaur designed on the outside  but the gummies are as well. I love that they contain most of the vitamins and supplements that he needs for his growing body in an easy to take gummy. Of course  with any gummies like this you need to keep them out of the little one's reach as I know mine would eat more of them if I didn't control them. Outside of that  it's a great way to keep his health optimal and I don't need to wrestle with him to take it  lol. Great idea  great multivitamin!,1
hands warm when it is above 32,They suck.. I have used these for 2 months.  They have kept my hands warm when it is above 32.  Below 32 and I have to add another layer.  The stitching on these have started coming off.  Also the touch screen sections are extremely annoying.  I have now given up on these and switched to flip top mittens that are for ice fishing.,1
allergy alert,fresh and soft. These are subtle licorice pieces. There are pieces that are predominately coconut. I like them.  My bag arrived with a distant &#34use by date&#34 and was soft and fresh. For me  I am so happy to read the ingredient list.  No red dye #40 or yellow #5 or 6.  Here is the ingredient list on the bag: Sugar  cane molasses  wheat flour  glucose syrup (contains sulphites)  desiccated coconut  palm oil  beef gelatin  corn starch  glycerol  natural colors (plain caramel  beetroot red  curcumin  paprika). fat reduced cocoa  licorice exctract  natural flavorings (aniseed  lemon  raspberry  vanilla  orange) glazing agent (beeswax) fruit and vegetable juices for coloring. Allergy alert: equipment shared with products that include peanuts  tree nuts  milk  egg  soy and wheat. NOT a health food.  But a delightful treat without harmful dyes still legal in the USA.,0
couldn't lay on it for more than 5 minutes,This is horrible. 0 stars if I could give 0. It was hard to fill with air  no matter how much we flopped it around.  We finally used a heavy duty blower to fill it up.  After filling it up  we laid on it and the air started seeping right out.  Couldn't lay on it for more than 5 minutes.  I do not recommend.,0
not being patient,It all worked out. I can not do a product review because I have not received it . I bought this product 3 weeks ago and today I received it  I’m very glad and sorry for not being patient. I would give it a five but it was along time get to me.,0
gift tokens small,TOO tight. Up side.... 1.not a lot of ads... except to buy tokens Down side.... 1. SUPER tight payouts... (cause they want you to buy tokens  right?) but that makes you less likely to play 2.  Once a day &#34gift&#34 tokens... VERY small - most of the time used in 2 spins 3.  They bring in new games and then take them away... so far  the really fun games! 4.  A bunch of &#34high roller&#34 games that are ridiculous to play unless you buy millions of tokens  so they are a waste 5.  Even after &#34buying&#34 tokens they STILL don't pay out any better and STILL accost you with ads to buy more tokens. 6.  The worst part is that in order to make an &#34account&#34 so you don't loose you purchased tokens you MUST allow them access to your facebook!!! You would think if you'd purchased tokens you could set up using an email.. I got the msg after trying to set up with my gmail  &#34We are currently not allowing account setups with gmail.&#34  - or any other email. So I guess when I run out of the tokens I bought I will just uninstall. BEWARE of &#34unhelpful&#34 votes as they are likely the seller that doesn't like that you are providing honest reviews.,0
clear,Four Stars. OK BUT WISH THEY WERE CLEAR.,0
makes crating far more comfortable,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
good descriptive intimate scenes,My review of Bigger than the sky. Beautiful  contemporary love story. Well-written  edited  all the characters were likeable  believable plot and it just flowed really well. Amelia and Kade reconnect in the small town they grew up in five years after she left him at the altar. She has to learn to trust him again  learn to say sorry and practice forgiveness. We watch her struggle with all three but succeed in the end  of course. Kade is the typical alpha male and what can I say but ... yes. There are a lot of very good but descriptive intimate scenes. A lot. Not complaining though because they were written in very well. What I also truly enjoyed was the humor. Being inside Amelia's head was wonderful  she is a good mess. Overall  a very good book and because I loved the other characters I would definitely continue with the series.,1
come loosely packaged,Surprisingly this works well to remove my cream eye make-up. I tried many different make-up remover products and have always been disappointed because they never remove what they say it will remove and I have to use a ton of solution or wipes. However  these surprisingly work. I used this to remove cream eyeshadow and it did a wonderful job. In addition  my lids felt moisturized. Note each cloth is infused with Vitamin E and Aloe.  There are 10 (I received 11) individually wrapped disposable cloths in each package. They come loosely packaged in an envelope  so I have to put them in a zip lock bag to store.  At the current price of 9.50 ($10 minus 5%)  it comes to $.95 cents per remover cloth. I certainly would not make a steady diet of these since they are expensive  but they are perfect for that once-in-awhile situation where one needs to remove their make-up without soap and water. ,0
leakage issues when he gets up after sitting,Works. Fits my older dog nicely. He has leakage issues when he gets up after sitting and these really help everything stay dry.,0
dried out,Good beef jerky  excellent lightly spiced  perfect for snacking. Great not-overly-spicy beef jerky. Perfect size for packing in my lunch bag for a mid afternoon snack. This is definitely one of my favorites. I did deduct a star because even though the flavor was great  I did find this pack a little on the dry side. I am going to order another package before month end and if I find the next package to be better  I will be adding to this review and changing it to a 5 star. My brother and nephew really love this jerky  too  and have been eating it for years  so I know it's got to be good!,0
boring moment,Better Than Average. There are so many mediocre movies out there that just aren't that good.  I thought this was a cut above that.  Sure it's a bit predictable and it's not exactly non-stop action that takes your breath away  but it has an interesting plot and it moves along well.  The actors all do a good job and are convincing in their roles.  Eva Longoria seems a bit out of her league and her character doesn't develop into that much  but she sure is easy on the eyes.  She's okay  but they could have done a bit more with her character.  It's not a 5-star movie  but there was never a boring moment for me.  Do you want to own it? perhaps not.  Probably better as a one time rental  although it's entertaining enough to watch over again  once in a while.,0
value,Great value. Made my shopping much better good value,1
nasal passages are too small,nasal dilator. These nasal dilators do not work for me - but maybe for some one?  They are silicone tiny tubes.  Comes with various sizes - you pinch them and put them up your nose.  But I found them uncomfortable and actually plugged my nose.. maybe my nasal passages are too small - which is the only reason I didn't rate them a 1 star.  Might work for some?   Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes. Bottom line  I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,0
regular alcohol wipes,Great for kids with eczema!. I have two kids with eczema on their hands and they cannot use regular alcohol wipes.  These wipes were perfect and did not sting their skin and it wipes clean!  They don't leave a residue after wiping either which is a plus!,0
more a guys thing,VHS to Blu ray. Classic Classic Classic I got my kids to like this movie from the VHS version (i remember old fireside theater).  had to get the Blu ray version as our DVD had died (scratches from too many viewings and kids not putting it up correctly).  dang this is still funny. the quality seems a bit better (only a flesh wound).  you can't go wrong with this movie. but as my wife says... its more a guys thing (except my daughter likes it).,0
BluRay version of the original film release,Musical Nirvana for the diehard '70s Elvis fan. Elvis in concert in the '70s.  Always a bone of contention among fans  probably because -- like the '60s film years -- it was allowed to go on too long and Elvis found himself in another artistic rut.  Happily  the downturn had yet to really take hold at the time of Elvis On Tour.  He was still involved and committed and enjoying it all in 1972  and fans -- both newbies and long term -- were the better for it all.  This collection's highlights include three previously unreleased full shows as well as a remixed concert  rehearsals  and behind the curtain RCA Studio C  Hollywood tracks  plus the BluRay version of the original film release.  A visit to Elvis Nirvana for Elvis diehards.  What would've made it all the better  for me anyway  would have been the reconstruction of the Standing Room Only (original  discarded title) soundtrack album.  That proposed 1972 LP was sacrificed in favor of the Madison Square Garden album (which actually even copped its cover photo!).  Thus  the singles Burning Love b/w It's a Matter of Time and Separate Ways b/w Always on My Mind were relegated to budget Camden releases  and An American Trilogy b/w The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face remained homeless.  Thus far it's only ever been available as an overly expensive Follow That Dream import release.  Including it here would've been the perfect -- though decades late -- salute to early '70s Elvis and his fans.  Still  as is  On Tour is worthy of five golden scarves and I highly recommend it.,0
stinks so bad,STINKS!!!!. OK so this product is amazing at catching flies however it stinks so bad! My whole backyard smells like a rotting fish market within like four days. We moved it to an even for their location away from the area where everyone hangs out in and it still stunk so bad. We had to throw it away. I would so totally buy this if you were not anywhere near it but if you plan to be socializing within 300 yards or so from it prepare for stink,0
decently written,Liked it a lot. Samantha  a nurse is kidnapped by an FBI agent on the run with a young boy. She ends up going on the run with them and helps him to discover who wanted them dead. A lot of suspense  a good plot and decently written. A few misspelled words and bouncing between POV's without warning was confusing. Also  too many scenes were neatly explained away and too many simple daily functions were never included which took away the believability of the story. Aside from that I adored the family dynamic and the happily ever after.,1
weekly menu planner,Fantastic blend of complete menus  seasonality  and international flavors. My friend and James Beard Award-winning cookbook author Meike Peters recently released her latest cookbook “365: A Year of Everyday Cooking and Baking” and graciously sent a copy to me here in Japan  where I eagerly pored over the gorgeous food photography with its tantalizing  jewel-like salads.  Meike’s cooking is very much guided by the seasonal calendar  and in “365”  you’ll find a year’s worth of complete menus (including salads  soups  pasta  sandwiches  vegetables  seafood  meat and sweets) that make the most of seasonal produce  marrying them with a range of international influences including hearty German fare  Middle Eastern  and Mediterranean flavors and inspirations.  With the falling of the leaves and the arrivals of colder weather and flurries  the recipes featuring bright  sunny citrus are a welcome respite. Dishes like Winter Caprese with Blood Orange  Beet and Mozzarella di Bufala  Spaghetti with Ricotta  Orange and Crispy Sage Chocolate and Orange Pannetone  and Sicilian Orange Salad with Olive Oil  Marjoram  and Flaky Sea Salt are sure to stave off winter colds and chase the winter blahs away with the generous amount of vitamin C.  Others like Potato and apple-stuffed cabbage rolls with Walnut Butter and Gruyere  German beef  beet and potato stew  and Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Shallots and Apple  provide stick-to-your-ribs comfort.  The salads are a particular delight  including the rainbow potato salad with radishes  shallot vinaigrette and poached eggs  beet and apple carpaccio with pomegranate  raw asparagus and peach salad with orange blossom water and pecorino  and rainbow potato and cucumber salad with dill-pistachio pesto that will bring a splash of color (and flavor!) to overcast days.  Seasonal ingredients are given light-handed treatments that allow their individual textures and delicate flavors to shine  like fresh strawberries with saffron-vanilla sugar  watermelon caprese with mozzarella di bufala  basil and mint  and squash pasta with orange  maple and sage.  If you are someone who  like me  can never seem to come up with a complete menu  that’s one of the beauties of 365: You can also use the weekly menu planner to come up with a seasonal balanced meal by combining the various options for a given week.  I was absolutely intrigued by the idea of candied cherry tomatoes slow roasted and tossed with olive oil  confectioner’s sugar  and herbs  they dissolve into a silky confit that is the perfect complement for fresh pasta and tiny basil. Plus the leftover oil and tomatoes make a fantastic dipping oil!  Measurements and temperatures are provided in both US / Imperial and metric.  This has become one of my favorite cookbooks of the last several years highly recommended.,1
bright white beard,santa hair and beard. The picture shows such a lovely bright white beard and hair piece... however.. the one I received is really gray.  NOT bright white at all. Disappointed.  It comes netted  so I removed a bit of the netting to see it was just the netting that was gray... sadly not.  The netting does keep the faux hairs neat until you want to use them.  However  I am going to be looking for a more true white set. UPDATE:  11/22... Ok... The wig is a mess.  We discarded it.  And again... the beard is GRAY.... NOT WHITE.  However  I will report that it is very full.,0
fabulous,The Rosie blanket for my Rosie Grace 🌹. Oh it’s fabulous  exceeded my expectations! Got it for my senior furbaby but would recommend it for a baby as well.,1
Takes AA batteries - does not come with batteries,"night light snuggle. I have a 5 year old grandson who needs just a little night light and this guy is perfect... he's soft and his light softly morphs from one color or another - turns off after a bit - stays on long enough for him to fall asleep.  Reminds me of the fruit stripe zebra... It's pretty big... about 14 or 15""... toe to head... Takes AA batteries - does not come with batteries. I feel like this guy will last probably longer than my little guy will need him - or at least I hope so!  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",0
works amazingly,The best I’ve used. This works amazingly on my cats! So easy to clean up,1
cute,This is really cute. The little sparkles give the .... This is really cute.  The little sparkles give the appearance of diamonds moving floatingly behind the image of the owl.  The head of the owl is suppose to be diamonds and in the feathers on the bottom. The cover fits perfectly on my phone!,1
box is super cute,No directions. The box is super cute and I while the crafts are not the greatest quality  they look cute. The problem is  they don’t come with directions!!! I messaged them and no response so this is a complete bust unfortunately.,1
Amazon wrapping this up nicely and shipping it overnight,Pretty Enough Box and Bow for Any Occasion. It's a $25 gift card. I bought it to take advantage of an Alexa/Echo offer. The box and bow are attractive but they were in the garbage in five minutes and a few minutes after that the credit balance was in my account. Sending the pretty box and bow was nice and only other option was a white gift box with bow. Why I couldn't have been emailed the $25 code I don't know but I actually feel a little guilty for Amazon wrapping this up nicely and shipping it overnight. I'd have been happy with a code to copy  paste and redeem. Now all Amazon had to do  as promised  is email my $5 voucher for buying this $25 card.,1
not get a whole hairpiece,You get ONE PIECE. Important to realize. Well  I am not sure why someone would want this particular hair piece. It is ok  and the hair feels very slick. But you only get ONE piece  so it would not be enough for most hairstyles.  I misplaced my photos  but will add them when I find them. It is just super important to realize you do not get a whole hairpiece  but just one small clip's worth of hair. To look like the vendor photo  you would need to buy 10-12 of these.,0
love the color and thickness of the material,Comfortable. Great quality set. Perfect for working out or lounging. Love the color and thickness of the material. I normally wear a small or medium and the medium fit perfectly. Love the tie waist and ribbed texture.,1
some vitamins and other good ingredients,Very nice makeup removal pads. These are nice makeup removal pads. You get a jar with 70 of these pads that are soaked with the removal solution. And of course when you are done there is some of that solution on the bottom that you can use with regular cotton pads. These makeup pads are very nice and work well. The removal solution is very gentle  probably because it includes cica solution in it as well as some vitamins and other good ingredients.  They smell very good and I found are gentle enough to use around the eyes. I had no issues removing foundation  lipsticks are eye makeup. All in all I am very happy with these. The price is rather reasonable too at $12 for 70 of these pads. I think these should be good for sensitive people except may the fragrance that is fairly strong but pleasant. But since these are gentle enough to use around the eyes they should be good for sensitive skin.,1
handmade,my favorite gift i bought for me. Craftsmanship superb and love the fact its handmade.  I have lots of jewelry.  It sets in special boxes and beautiful containers.  This i want to wear all the time.  I just ordered the mustard seed pendant.  I also make my own jewlery.  Wish i had made it!,1
4 year old granddaughter,Christmas gift. Bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter and she made us a Christmas card out of the box. It was really cute.,1
good weight,Beautiful colors. I Can't have enough bird feeders. This 1 is very nice With a good weight so it doesn't blow around on a windy day.All the birds love it.,1
long enough to look great with leggings,"Perfect for fall and winter wear!. Really nice tunic top with hoodie  perfect for the colder weather. I live in northern Florida and I am always looking for warm tops that I can use during fall/winter/spring evening wear. This tunic is a perfect fit (I am 5'7"" 160 lbs and I got a size large)  it's soft and attractive  long enough to look great with leggings and is light enough to wear in 60 degree temperatures and also warm enough to wear in days and evenings colder than that. I really love this tunic and highly recommend!",1
highly recommend,Great protein drink  satisfies and is good for you. This is my new favorite mid-afternoon protein drink. I take it with me to work and have a tasty  satisfying treat that is good for me and satisfies my hunger and sweet cravings. When I am not working  I take a bottle of this and pour it in my Ninja along with some fresh blueberries and strawberries and some ice to make the most amazing smoothie. I love that something that tastes so good and gives me the nutrients that my body needs. Highly recommend this for everyone.,1
good buy,Make good house slippers. I have flat feet so these were perfect  they are also warm and have a good grip.  I wear these as house sleepers because my feet get very cold in regular slippers.  I also have to let the dog out and don't have to worry about slipping.  Was a good buy and will buy more when I need them.,1
high quality,High quality. Great stamp for my daughters Christmas card.,1
one capsule,Deceptive advertising  only one capsule. Only one piece will be received  no where does it state one item only and picture shows 3 pieces.,0
Too small,Returning these. Too small and opening is wide in the front,0
black and gold plastic,rubber band six shooter. I purchased as a prop to a costume really  and as the appearance of a six shooter - it's ok.  I don't want it to look like a real gun.  As a rubberband gun... Eh.  You cannot load more than 1 rubber band at a time and it shoots the rubber band about 30% of the time.  The trigger is  really wonky - it bends back and forth - thus part of the firing problem.  It is black and gold plastic.  So... in conclusion - if you're looking for a toy gun... it's ok.  If you're looking to fire rubber bands  keep looking.,1
wish it had sensors in the keys,I love the quality of this. This sounds amazing  and it is a good beginer's tool  but it is huge.  I did not pay enough attention to the dimensions when I bought it.  I have literally no room for this to just stand by to use  so I must put it away after every use along with my stand for it.  I does sound great though--I only wish that it had some kind of sensors in the keys so as to tell how hard you used them...sigh  guess you can't have everything at a reasonable price point.,0
cheap case,Too cheap for such a nice phone. I had this same case on my pixel 3 and loved it. However something about the pixel 6 just feels too nice to have such a cheap case. Spigen is great and I have a different model on my pixel 6 pro  but this one just looked and felt cheap on it.,0
red corner,large dial corded phone. purchased for use when the power goes out... giant number/buttons... NOT back lit... but super easy to see.  Speaker phone works  handy when you need to keep your hands free.  3 giant boxes for pictures of persons you want to speed dial... I don't use that part... but this phone was designed for an older person I think.  :)  A considerable amount of control options... med  high or very high handset volume... ringer hi/lo or off... and a slide control of the speaker volume...  It has a redial button.  A speaker button.  And a flash button.  It has a red corner on the top left that indicates the ring - so when you have the ring off (and when it is on) that light flashes.  There is a dedicated 911 button that is red. The handset sets in the cradle fairly well at the top... the bottom a bit less... and the bottom is what matters.  If the bottom is off the cradle  the phone registers off the hook. I use it sitting on a corner stand... it does have a hole you could hand on the wall.  It is bright white.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. I hope that the time I took to write this detailed review is helpful to you in some way!,0
gluing fabric to fabric,fabric fusion glue. Ok.  This stuff works.  IF you're gluing FABRIC to FABRIC.  Nothing else.  And NO felt.  Another note.  Use gloves or tweezers to apply.  Wash immediately if you get any on your skin.  If you have 2 layers  makes sure to put something plastic between the two layers.  I haven't tried to wash it yet  but I think it's pretty solid.  Having said all of that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,0
clip,Good brightness levels  battery life is really good. clip a bit weak.. After trying/owning other portable  battery-operated lights & lamps  have to say this is my favorite for its reliable output of light and its sturdiness. Its battery life is pretty good too. The only thing I wish were better is the 'clip'. Depending on the surface its attached to  it does not always hold well. It (clip) is small but also rather bulky and not very strong to give good support to the bulkiness of the light.,0

And make sure you buy the right S pen. You need the pen made the S21 ultra. I wanted to like the case. The case I have used most is the Speck Presidio 2 Grip.,0
planned vacations around Archaeology's articles,"Ahhhh ... my favorite magazine. I'm not an archaeologist. If I was born redundantly wealthy I think that I might have been one.  Archaeology is my ""stop everything and read it on the day it arrives"" magazine. I've been a subscriber for years. I read EVERY article. As a reader of archaeology and paleontology tomes  this magazine is the adjunct to my selections of books to read. My wife and I have planned vacations around Archaeology's articles.  I've detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites.  During a cross country moving event 7 years ago  I let the subscription expire for lack of new address. Someone from Archaeology  not a telemarketer for sure  called me and said that I had been such a long term customer that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew ... was it something about the magazine quality? The voice on the other end was just so dang disappointed as she pleaded for feedback that it was stunning enough for me to remember 7 years later. The magazine must be read by a small but dedicated subscriber base and I think the magazine staff themselves makes the calls.  My only complaint is that it only prints every 2 months. If archaeology is among your interests  you would entertain your fancies with a subscription.",1
characters not well developed,Pretty Predictable/Fairly Boring. I chose this from the library because the author wrote &#34Cages&#34  one of my favorites. It was not as well-written  possibly because it was for a younger audience. Kehret did not flavor with details like she usually does  and the characters did not seem very well developed. It kept my attention enough to finish  but not read again.,0

tight payouts,TOO tight. Up side.... 1.not a lot of ads... except to buy tokens Down side.... 1. SUPER tight payouts... (cause they want you to buy tokens  right?) but that makes you less likely to play 2.  Once a day &#34gift&#34 tokens... VERY small - most of the time used in 2 spins 3.  They bring in new games and then take them away... so far  the really fun games! 4.  A bunch of &#34high roller&#34 games that are ridiculous to play unless you buy millions of tokens  so they are a waste 5.  Even after &#34buying&#34 tokens they STILL don't pay out any better and STILL accost you with ads to buy more tokens. 6.  The worst part is that in order to make an &#34account&#34 so you don't loose you purchased tokens you MUST allow them access to your facebook!!! You would think if you'd purchased tokens you could set up using an email.. I got the msg after trying to set up with my gmail  &#34We are currently not allowing account setups with gmail.&#34  - or any other email. So I guess when I run out of the tokens I bought I will just uninstall. BEWARE of &#34unhelpful&#34 votes as they are likely the seller that doesn't like that you are providing honest reviews.,0
two of the same color,will work. I ordered 2 of these and it would have been so nice if they'd sent two different colors... but no. Two of the same.  I have a mouth guard AND invisalines for top and bottom.  So I ordered the two.  I don't really care what they look like... I two I got were a muddled white and teal mostly.  They will work.  They are an average/typical size.  Good for storage only  not for cleaning with water and the tablets you can buy.  Just in case you thought you'd might try that.,0
work as intended,As Pictured. These hooks are just as pictured. They aren't super thick  but at the same time  they don't bend easily. They work as intended. I am satisfied with them.,1
Holiday pack from last year,Only worth it if on sale. Like others said  this stuff pack is the Holiday pack from last year plus 20 more items. There are some lovely items but EA still doesn't seem to realize that they are shooting themselves in the foot by offering the stuff packs at $19.99. Lowering the price here to $14.99 is a bit better but not by much.  The only reason why I bought this stuff pack was because Circuit City had it on sale for $9.99 between November 19-22. If I'd been paying attention over the summer I would have bought Family Fun & Glamour at Circuit City at those prices but I missed the sales. $10-12 I think is a fair price for the amount of stuff in the pack. If EA set the price to that I believe the stuff packs would literally fly off the shelves. Every time one of these new packs come out I will be keeping my eyes on the Circuit City sales flier in the paper and buy from them.,1
Simple to set up,Simple to set up. Just received product. But instructions are very easy to follow,1
extra stick,Really like these. So why 4 stars?  I read the review  measured it out and decided for the large instead of the next larger choice  because I really have some thick hair.  They are so pretty  and they even gave me an extra stick. I love using them however I can't use them as I did when I was younger (yes in the 70's).  I can't get the barrette around my hair - I have to use a band first - which defeats both it being pretty and it's use to begin with.  I can attach it  but not around 'all' of my hair.  So I should have ordered the larger ones  because I was trying to omit the band altogether as they give my headaches which is why I used them back in the day.  So I eventually cut my hair length and now use these just to tack the front hair back.  If you have really thick hair  buy the larger size!,0

"narrower mass appeal than ""Farm Chicks in the Kitchen""","Retro-inspired country Christmas is a walk down memory lane.... ""The Farm Chicks Christmas"" by Serena Thompson is the follow-up to 2009's [[ASIN:1588168662 The Farm Chicks in the Kitchen: Live Well  Laugh Often  Cook Much]]. The first Farm Chicks book was a countrified cookbook peppered liberally with stories and reminiscences by Serena and Teri  antiques-inspired craft ideas (a reusable stencil was included in the front)  and comfort food: easy recipes for breakfast treats  appetizers  soups and salads  and decadent desserts  over fifty in all.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas "" on the other hand  is written only by Serena  a contributing editor for Country Living magazine and antiques show hostess (her best friend Teri has retired from their business). The book still includes numerous country-inspired craft ideas you'll find decorative  retro-inspired self-adhesive gift tags and notecards at the back  along with various decorating ideas for ""the most wonderful time of the year."" However  the ratio of crafts to recipes is reversed from the first book there are only 17 recipes included at the back with gift-giving suggestions on how to package them.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" captures the magic of childhood Christmases  from family visits to the tree farm (complete with recipe ideas for hot drinks to tote along)  holiday decorating ideas (holiday scalloped bunting  vintage-inspired snowball pompom ornaments  cone trees and vintage funnel trees  banners and more)  and photos of Serena's friends' and family's homes decorated for Christmas.  Much of the book is more like a scrapbooked photo essay  with crafts sprinkled in every few pages. Also  the decorating tips (and included photos) are vintage country in the Farm Chicks fashion: displaying old farm toys standing in coconut snow  for example  or stacking metal funnels to make ""trees."" If you're not a fan of all things country  this probably isn't the holiday book for you.  The included holiday recipes are few  and aimed mostly at gift-giving  like the sweet and salty nuts  mini orange bundt cakes  and various types of cookies (butter cutouts  chocolate-covered peanut butter balls  snowballs  Spritz cookies). As with the previous book  a handy list of metric equivalent charts is provided at the back. I tried the sweet and salty nuts recipe first  and though tasty  I didn't think that the ""sweet"" flavor predominated it was more of a subtle afterthought (there's only 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of honey for 3 cups of nuts).  Overall  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" is a nostalgic walk down a snowy memory lane  but it has narrower mass appeal than ""Farm Chicks in the Kitchen"" due to the reversal of the recipe-to-crafts ratio and the genre-specific decorating style (I enjoyed the many beautiful photographs  but won't find myself making yarn-ball wreaths or filling jars with spare Christmas lightbulbs anytime soon).

hopeful ending,So amazing. Couldn't put this one down. Not really much I can say about this one. Very enjoyable and a hopeful ending.,1
Davy Spillane,"5 stars alone for including Brian Kennedy's magnificent ""Carrickfergus""!!. I am an all-out Brian Kennedy fanatic. Brian who  you ask? Brian Kennedy  Belfast-born singer with a voice of spun gold  was Van Morrison's back up singer for several years  recorded the *original* You Raise Me Up (NOT Josh Groban)  starred in hundreds of Riverdance on Broadway shows  and for all of that  he's unheard-of in the US. Celtic Circle 2 includes Brian's soul-wrenching rendition of ""Carrickfergus "" a beautiful song of lament  accompanied only by Brian's less-is-more acoustic guitar. Haunting.  Besides the wonderful gift of Brian Kennedy  Celtic Circle 2 builds on the solid combination of modern Celtic music and Irish-influenced New Age that was so successful on Vol. 1. This time around  we have two discs of the Chieftains (the timeless ""Love Theme from Barry Lyndon"" and ""The Foggy Dew"" with Sinead O'Connor)  Clannad (Caislean Oir  Newgrange  Almost Seems)  Maire Brennan  Irish-American powerhouse Cherish The Ladies  Aine Minogue  Nightnoise  fabulous Irish bagpiper Davy Spillane  James Galway  and the stellar team of Susan McKeown and Natalie Merchant on ""River."" Sarah McLachlan even makes an early appearance with Celtic-inspired ""Drawn To The Rhythm."" My only lament is that Loreena McKennitt wasn't featured Ms. McKennitt's early works were classical Celtic-influenced melodies set to famous poems  accompanied by harp.  It's a much-welcome breath of fresh air to see Celtic and New Age done so well  as BMG has consistently shown on its ""Celtic Circle"" releases. So many ""Celtic"" releases are in fact substandard New Age treacle with anonymous vocals and synth instruments  but here we have 30 outstanding tracks that capture the lyric  melancholy beauty of the Irish nature  recorded by masters of the trade (the Chieftains have been around for more than three decades!). Yes  there are New Age pieces  too  tracks from Lord of the Rings and Titanic  but there is a much more balanced look at modern Celtic on Celtic Circle 2 than on the first (more Celtic  less New Age).  Perfect music for relaxing to at the end of a long day -- light a few candles  close your eyes  and let the soothing Celtic melodies inspire and refresh your weary spirit.",1
fit my six year old and two year old,Not bad. I think the masks work for kids. Covers their mouth and nose. It fit my six year old and two year old. As another reviewer mentioned  the words are mirrored so that is a little weird.,1
the execution was superb,Five well earned stars... I loved book one. Lissy and Luke's story captured my attention and I couldn't stop reading. I didn't think the second book of the series could be much better but.. it was. Matt and Brook's story was just as amazing but different. Matt and Brooklyn were friends for over two years because Brooklyn was afraid of losing her best friend. Matt patiently waited for the woman that he knew was the one. Although the plot read like a typical love story the execution was superb. The writing was complex  honest  factual and complete. I didn't have the urge to slam my kindle against the wall because of grammatical errors  piecemeal writing or undeveloped characters. This book is print worthy and if you're an e-book reader you should understand what that is... I would give up a section of my bookcase to a print copy of this series. I like this author and respect her writing style therefore I will be picking up book three. Recommended but start with Book 1.,1
doesn't work well,OK. I have used PFB vanish normally and decided to try this set instead. Its OK nothing spectacular. Very heavy alcohol with the tend skin  it does work however but its just OK in my book. I will definitely keep and use but not sure I'd repurchase. The roller/travel item- its nice that it can be refilled but just doesn't work all that well.,0
ads,Too many “ gear ads” !!. Too many ads!,0
expensive luxury,"Mixed blessing  but so far  so good. I looked at probably 20 portable ice makers before choosing this one. Price was a factor  but so was customer input from reviews. It seemed like many of the other models were the exact same machine with a different company label stuck on them  and their reviews were so varied  it seemed like you either got a lemon or a good one.  Also  all the others opened at the top and vented on the side. For some reason  I thought this one would work better in our area  with the drawer pulling out at the front  and I THOUGHT the vent would be at the side like all the other machines.  My purpose in buying this is not for a bar or camper  like many people. I am partially disabled  and can't get downstairs to the kitchen on any sort of regular basis. I really wanted to be able to have ice when I wanted some  especially with the heat of summer rolling in very  very soon. I don't like room temperature drinks  esp water or tea  so I'd found myself drinking Pepsi almost exclusively  the only thing I could stand at room temp. That needed to stop!  So  I ended up buying this one  but the experience was not a pleasant one. I love my Amazon prime dearly  but they really botched this one. The shipping dates got moved around even after I paid extra for one-day shipping  and ended up with this being delivered on a totally different day  when I was the only one home and could not come to the door. (Note that Amazon did end up giving me a small credit on my acct to try to make up for the shipping problem  even though it did not solve my problem.) I always chat with the UPS guys through the upstairs window  so they left it for me anyway. I knew my son would be home very shortly after  and he was. He brought the box up  and I have to say that I am almost positive I got a customer return. The box looked like it had previous shipping labels peeled off of it. The box was beat up  torn  and had a crushed in spot on the side. Our UPS guys are really great  so I think it was shipped out from Day One looking like that - who in the warehouses think customers really want something that looks that bad?! (And yes  I know this is a product review section  and I can file shipping problems elsewhere  and I will. Just giving folks a heads-up of how it is shipped and what I received.) This is shipped in its original mfg box with tie cords on it  there is no other packaging other than what the mfg sends it out with - no Amazon packaging whatsoever. Strike One.  I opened the box  not sure of what I would find. It only has two big strips of styrofoam on the sides to hold it. Ours indeed had a dent in the side  and one of the back exhaust fans had cracked plastic. Not a crisis  but at this price  I really do expect a brand new item in great condition! Strike Two.  SMELLS/TASTE: I read a lot of reviews that talk about the plastic smell and/or taste in the cubes  and how it didn't seem to want to fire up well. IF someone reads the directions (not everyone likes to do that!)  you'd see it says to make sure the machine sits for at least an hour to allow the coolant to properly settle back into place after you unpack it. This particular model also says to run a bleach solution through it to help clean it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT!! The machine indeed smells heavily of plastic. Anyone who has had a relay switch burn out on an item knows what smell I am talking about - sort of like melting plastic. Ugh. However  having read plenty about portable ice makers before buying one  I knew that either vinegar or lemon juice would also work just fine. I chose to go with one that was ingestible  rather than bleach!! We did the lemon juice  and ran an entire cycle of cubes through it with the lemon/water. (Toss the ice please!) I then ran two loads (all the cubes a full water tank would make) through it of plain water. AFTER those cycles  I wiped it out again and ran regular water through it to try making cubes we'd use. We had no problems at all with any funny tastes in our ice this way. If you have a bad quality of tap water though  I'd suggest using either bottled  filtered or distilled water. It is only natural that your cubes will not taste better than your tap water. Ours is okay  so we're good that way. I would have bought a water filter (like a Brita) if that had not been the case. No lemony taste  no plastic taste  no gross tastes or odors at all. (Remember  I really do NOT recommend using bleach like the mfg suggests. While I understand the germ-killing properties of the bleach  I really don't want to ingest any of it. I would also think it would be much more caustic to the plastic parts and hoses of the machine  wearing them out sooner. Stick with lemon juice.) It did smell like plastic out the exhaust fan for quite a while  but it is fading away.  NOISE: Of course it is going to make noise. This has a compressor  and it will be making some noise. However  I've found that at its noisiest part of the cycle  it is no different than a microwave oven running  sometimes a little quieter.The ice cubes dumping make me jump a little bit  at least at first  but then again I am easily startled. Made the cats jump too! LOL! However  they are pretty much used to it now  even if they eyeball it suspiciously while it is running.  I have to say that I haven't stopped to time an actual cycle to make the ice. I've tried the small  medium and large cubes though. They are all gumdrop-shaped (or like the Dots candy at the movies)  with a hole in the middle of the bottom. It didn't seem to take very long though. The small ones were a little too small for my uses  but would be good for smaller drink glasses. I use a [[ASIN:B003X46LHG Bubba Brands Keg 52 Oz Mug Slate Gray]] to hold the ice at the moment  and love it. If you use the medium size  you can get the first batch in around 10 minutes  but the other batches do seem to take longer for some reason. It has also seemed to get ""stuck"" where it runs and runs  with nothing going on. I turn it off  let it sit a minute and push start again  and off it goes. I am not sure if it is just my machine with the dents from rough handling  or if all of this model is like that.  I was disappointed that this unit does not exhaust on the side  reason being where I planned to locate it  on a table behind my bed! It would vent towards my pillow  which is just not gonna happen. So  I have it turned sideways so it will vent towards the doorway. It makes opening the ice drawer more awkward  and makes me wish I'd tried one of the top-opening models now. There wasn't anything in the photos and such to suggest that this unit would be different than most of the other portable ice makers. It is. I'll post photos at a later date.  This model's book also suggests plugging the machine in to a GFI outlet  or grounded plug that will shut off if it senses dampness. I don't have one in the bedroom  and currently am using a heavy-duty  three-prong extension cord and plugging it in in the bathroom  where we do have a GFI plug. Not ideal  but better than trying to get a special outlet installed in a rented bedroom.  The scoop is VERY tiny. It works best to scoop towards you  so you don't send ice cubes back into the machine. The measuring cup works well for pouring  because you have a small reservoir to fill  and you have to go over a small clear rubber ""wall"" that helps to hold the drawer in place and hold temperatures.  Any unused ice does indeed melt back into the reservoir and is recycled back into cubes. Once I have enough ice for anyone who wants it  I turn it off rather than let it continually cycle. I also unplug it in the evenings when I go to bed for the night  since I'm the only one who can't go downstairs for ice if they want it. I hope that saves on the ""vampire electricity"" of the unit. Note that this is not a refrigerated ice maker  and the unused ice WILL melt. Many people complained about ice cubes stuck together - I've only experienced that when getting ice that has been done for an hour or so (it keeps the ice for at least an hour after the last cycle at this point) - otherwise  the cubes are all loose and easy to use. If you try to take the ice drawer all the way out after leaving the ice sit for a while  it WILL leak water on you - the water is simply the ice melting back and going through the drain holes that let it run back into the reservoir. (Nope - I didn't even think about the drainage holes when I pulled the drawer out the first time  and had water on the table and the floor. That was my fault though.)  For now  I am mostly happy with it. I cannot tell you how nice it is to have ice when I want it  instead of waiting for someone to get home in the evening and get me some! It was an expensive luxury though  and one I really thought long and hard about getting since I can no longer work. I'm thinking I really want to keep it. The cosmetic issues were VERY annoying  since I paid for a new machine  not a used one  but in this case  I blame Amazon for sending this out with a crushed box from the get-go. I would not have accepted it  had I been able to get to the door and saw it. Again - for some reason  this was the most problematic purchase I've ever had in all my time on Amazon.  This machine has not reached Strike Three yet  but you can be sure I'll come back and update my review should that happen. For now  I'll keep running it  and see how it seems to work  dents  cracked exhaust grid and all. (The dents are even more annoying  because it has a stainless steel appearance. It shows readily. It was more of a hassle to return it than to just keep it  as long as it continues to work.)  UPDATE June 29  2012: Well  I've had this machine for a little over a month now. Is it perfect? Nope. Does it make ice? Yep. Does it make a little noise?  Yep  but not unbearable. So far  the broken parts do not seem to be affecting the basic function of the machine. While I still have not literally timed the cube cycle (I have good intentions  but seems like there's always something better to do than watch the clock for ice cubes to drop! Ha!)  I have found the medium cubes to be the most useful. In fact  I often use an empty Sobe Lifewater bottle to make quick tea (loving the new tea from Lipton with the honey in it)  and the medium cubes fit in this bottle perfectly. So  that might give folks a better idea about the size of the medium cube. The difference in the sizes are basically more (or less) layers of ice on the cubes. The small ones are still too big for a basic 16.9 oz water bottle  and melt too fast when I shake up my tea. The first batch of the day takes around 10 minutes  but for some reason  they are skinnier than the normal mediums. The machine makes additional batches inbetween 10-15 minutes. Around 2 or 2-1/2 of the water cup it comes with to fill the reservoir to maximum. That will fill the ice bin to the top with medium cubes.  At this point  I increased my stars by one  because of the function of the machine  and it being willing to do what I ""hired"" it to do - keep me in cold drinks. Strike three has not yet happened  and I hope it doesn't! Enjoy!",1

Circulon is simply the best,Can't buy a better set of cookware anywhere!. Let me begin by saying I love Circulon cookware. My kitchen is a walking advertisement for it. It is designed for the cook  from the detailed handles that fit correctly in the palm of your hand to the way the pots clean up beautifully. I have never had a problem with the non-stick cookware peeling or pitting or scratching in anyway (unlike the Calphalon I have had in the past). Now specific to this set: This is the perfect housewarming or shower present for the bride to be. This set will last for years and will make even the most novice chef appear to be a professional on the first try out. There is every size in the set (perhaps with the exception of a really large stock pot) which a chef could ever need. Last weekend  I actually used almost the whole set simultaneously cooking an Italian dinner for my extended family  and I can assure you the set was well used  scraped and stirred for several courses. After the set was washed   it looked like I just took it out of the box. Circulon may be a little more pricey than some lower cost manufacturers. But it's the old adage  you get what you pay for. Circulon is simply the best!,1

over 25 years with Amazon,touch and hold smooth dual door closer system. Husband purchased these to replace some others that had given up the ghost.  We live on the oceanfront and the salt takes a toll.  These are nice because you can do it with your foot (when install at the base of the door) just tap it and it stays open  tap again and it releases.  Easy Peasy.  He prefers these and says they are easy to install.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes. Bottom line  I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,1
signs of fatigue and despair,"Wonderful Music & A Gritty  Hard Life Story. One of the best things about this movie is the really good music it has  especially the vocals by a singer I never heard of before this movie.  Her name is Marideth Sisco  a homely  white-haired  rotund lady with the voice of an angel.  Hearing her singing in this movie makes it worth watching for that alone.  Other artists also contributed to the movie and they are all good.  I won't repeat the plot  which other reviewers have covered.  The biggest criticism I have seen is that this is an unfair portrayal of rural country people.  Yes and no.  I am sure there are people who are as scary and nasty as these in the country  but they are few and far between.  Just like anywhere  there are good and bad people in the country  just as in the city.  This is an entertainment movie not a documentary.  The biggest problem I have with the movie is that the actress who plays 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) in the movie seems a little too fresh faced and clean for the role.  Given the responsibility she has in the movie  you would expect her to show more signs of fatigue and despair  even at 17.  And some dirt she is always just too clean looking.  She does a good job in the role and perhaps the contrast between her purity and courage and the roughness  cowardliness and cruelty of those around her is one of the main points of the movie.  This is NOT a ""must see"" movie and is a little uncomfortable to watch at times  as some of the characters are pretty rough types.  For example  ""Teardrop""  the brother-in-law of the main character  sniffs cocaine several times during the movie.  Overall I stayed interested in seeing what was going to happen and the ending was somewhat satisfying.  If you don't want to watch the movie  buy the music soundtrack.  4 stars for the movie 5 stars for the soundtrack.",0
perfect for flat feet,Make good house slippers. I have flat feet so these were perfect  they are also warm and have a good grip.  I wear these as house sleepers because my feet get very cold in regular slippers.  I also have to let the dog out and don't have to worry about slipping.  Was a good buy and will buy more when I need them.,1
"""new brand""","this is a medium tint- definitely gives sun kissed glow  absorbs well  hydrates  non greasy. Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says  ""medium"" in the product description  which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level  so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle  BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink  with cool undertones. Still  I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in  but it gives me a slight tanned look  ""a sun kissed glow"".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..  This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen  using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays  converts them to heat  then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available  blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great  and it depends on what works best with  your skin.  This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious  skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter  jojoba  oilve oil  and vitamin e. It comes out thin  and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round  and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often  sweating it off  etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized  I feel better about keeping it so simple.  Again  I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the ""medium"" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a ""sun kissed glow"". If that is at all appealing to you  then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool  fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast  at all. If your skin is real oily  then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy  and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.  My skin: mid 40s  leans dry  semi sensitive  non-acne Rosacea (redness  visible veins)  I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year  and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else  it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot  and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck  then it gets used on rest of body.

recipe for bacalaitos,"Just no.... It was .99 which was the only reason I purchased it. As a collector somewhat of kindle cookbooks I am always on the lookout for great cookbooks on sale. This wasn't it. No pictures at all and when you have regional dishes that is a must. I have no clue what a dish I've never heard of should look like. Ingredients missing from the list. The recipe for bacalaitos was missing the cod on the list!!??? Another recipe has no cook time. It said ""broil"" but for how long??!! No editing  misspelled words etc...  I do not recommend wasting money on this book.",0
case is not very protective,"Not very protective - More for style. Got this Verso for my new 7"" HD Fire. I found the color bright and a really neon green  probably a little 'too bright' for a 50 something year old woman. I honestly think this color (and I assume the alternate pink as well) is better suited for teenagers. The case is thin and not very protective  though  so I think the idea of giving this to a teenager there may be better (more protective) alternatives. I would say go ahead and spen another $10 and get one of the better cases and skip the style/fashion side of a case for your Kindle.",0

sizing is WAY off,"print dress with pockets. I am 5'8""... 38DDD... usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  I purchased the black floral print.  First  the obvious... the sizing is WAY off.  Super too small.  If you have a chest at all - pass.  The elastic waist fits like an empire waist... the pockets are way too high (because it's too small) and oddly  the print material has a slight sheen to it... unlike the other photos I saw of the non-print.  It's heavy feeling and in weight.  The tag notes 95% Rayon 5% Spandex.  - feels like it.  There is some stretch - but the sleeves were uncomfortably snug - and way too snug across the chest.  The tag notes machine wash - but no dryer - hand dry and light iron if necessary.  Made in China.  Honestly  if you're a women of curves - as I am  I would NOT recommend this even in the 2x - it's just too small.  It's disappointing that the sizing is so off.  But having said that - I am not really a fan of the way the material feels and looks.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful  however  I am donating this dress - so there's not much more to say.  Hope this info helps you.",0
main character,No way. I love Christmas movies and I've found myself watching a lot of them even though it's only September. I've watched some pretty cheesy ones but this one was just awful from the get go! The very beginning was annoying and then the opening scene with the main character told me what I needed to know. I know this is really petty but her voice was horrible and her acting was just as bad. I couldn't handle this movie after seeing what it was going to be about  it was clear it wasn't worth wasting any more time on so I turned it off.,0
buttons are nice and large,"Decent controller  but the six-button may be more suitable.. For most of the earlier games on the Genesis  this controller works fine. The buttons are nice and large  and three is all you need for many of the platformers. For a majority of the other games  the six-button controller is a bit more useful  but also has a better shape (in my opinion). I find the three-button controller to be a bit goofy in the hands  and I can never find the ""perfect"" position to hold it in between my palms. The six-button one slides into my hands like most other controllers. Still  it's a great controller to own in any retro-game enthusiast's collection.",1

hyaluronic acid,Great serum to be using daily!. I love this Cerave Hyaluronic Acid product. I use it daily after showering on my 60 something skin and also at night before I go to sleep.  Not only does it have the hyaluronic acid my face needs  but it also contains vitamin B5 and helps to keep my skin hydrated. Reasonably priced (when compared to other expensive brands) this Cerave delivers on all counts. I definitely see a difference in using it for a few weeks now  my skin is plumper and looks far more youthful. I highly recommend!,1
dangerous item for someone with kids,Not What I Expected. I ordered this thinking it had a cigarette light charger so I could use it in my car. Nope - it has a standard USB charger. It has a cigarette LIGHTER so you can light your cigarette. Well  I have no need for a cigarette lighter  plus I think that could be a dangerous item for someone with kids. It does have a variety of charging types which is helpful and those work well. I don't have any apple products  so I couldn't test that out  but the others worked fine. I think the description needs to be improved so others don't make the same mistake that I do.,0

super moisturizing,Softest hands ever  lightly scented w/ lemongrass oil  lemon oil  orange oil  rosemary. I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!)  and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft  smooth  clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F)  dry day. Super moisturizing.  Oddly  I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps  and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches  nausea)  but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners)  I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass  but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil  orange oil  and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean  but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.  I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent  and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich  super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did  I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here  lol. I kinda want it as a body wash. My hands feel SO GOOD after using this. I just keep touching my hands.  One does not need a lot of soap  so feel free to just add a little to the hand. I would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down. Or if you like this soap and have a foamer  then just a wee bit of this with a lot of water will do it.  Love their designs on the bottles.  Water  Organic Coconut Oil  Organic Olive Oil  Vegetable Glycerin  Organic Guar Gum  Lemongrass Oil  Orange Oil  Organic Jojoba Oil  Lemon Oil  Rosemary Extract  Organic Aloe Vera (Potassium Hydroxide is used to saponify the organic oils into soap  but none remains in the final product),1
relief of being able to have some things macroed to a single mouse button,A Lot of Mouse. I have never used a gaming mouse before. Actually I've looked down on people who did for the same reason I don't like some players being on steroids in major league sports. But now that I'm getting older  my reactions are slower  my fingers are not as quick on the keys and...Oh...I guess I like it for exactly the same reasons athletes love steroids...  But on a serious note.  Mousing and key gnashing do take a toll. I don't know that this mouse is a complete solution to it. But I have had relief of being able to have some things macroed to a single mouse button.  If nothing else  it has created a different movement.  I like the quality of the mouse.  The tracking is very good  the feel is okay  the looks are richly industrial.  I'm not huge on the extending base to the mouse.  I just wish it had been a little bigger to fit my hand  but it fits fine without extending. Personally  a little heavier would feel a little better as well.  All in all I'm very impressed  and wished I had given into &#34juicing&#34 my game a long time ago.,1

hood ties are already fraying apart at the knotted ends,Yikes. What you see is definitely not what you get.. Terrible  Low Quality material. Would have returned it but I already washed it. Material is much thinner than it appears in photo and would probably only keep you warm if you sat in a sauna. The photo material looks like a thick polyester material you would HOPE is inner lined with fleece. Keep dreaming.  The outer material is actually a cheap cotton tee shirt-like material with an abrasive texture on inside that mimics sweats but not quite.  After two washings  the hood ties are already fraying apart at the knotted ends and have almost completely faded  even while using Cheer color guard. They definitely overpriced this product for the quality you receive. Don't bother.,0

pretty and of good quality,Beautiful & Good Quality. I just received this nose ring.  It is very pretty and of good quality.  The heart is a nice size and has a little sparkle to it.

natural potato chips,Disappointed. I have been getting the snack boxes for about a year now. When they first started they had a nice variety of healthy options that were different from usual snack fare. The last four boxes however have been a huge disappointment. I have even gotten the same product three months in a row. And the snacks seem to have degraded from actual healthy options to “health halo” options such as natural potato chips. After having been extremely disappointed for the third month in a row now  I am cancelling my subscription. I wouldn’t even recommend this unless you like getting the same things over and over.,0
-no protective seal,dense mask  smells good  great ingredients my tin is dented/no protective seal. My tin is dented.  It just arrived in a warehouse mailing bag. There was no protective tape  tamper sticker  or cover  or product box... so I am not sure what this product has been through before arriving to me. Ew. I know products are sold by weight not volume  but the container really does look like it is missing a portion  as it is half empty. It is probably all there. The container looks to be a 2 ounce capacity  with 1.7 ounces of product. The product is dense  so after settling  I imagine this is accurate. But still.. between the dented can and the lack of protective seal  I am reticent to use in on my face  and definitely won't be buying it as a gift (which I was considering as I ordered this for me  and figured if i liked it then I would buy it as part of a pampering gift).  Too bad because the container otherwise is attractive  the product smells good  and the ingredients are interesting highly nourishing & repairing for the skin. I love self care products  and doing an occasional mask is relaxing.  1.7 ounces has 3.4 tablespoons. Probably use half a table spoon to cover face. So maybe 7-8 full face applications? I guess price it out like a sheet mask. $3.75 per treatment if assuming 8 applications. More or less depending on how much you use.  I hope the company considers adding a seal or tamper sticker.,0

rough and snag things,sparkle lens covers with 'crystals' on rim. Samsung watch 4  40mm  frame covers.  I love sparkle  however  these are really rough and snag things - thus I removed it and tossed.  I wish the 'sparkle' crystal edge had been better polished and/or set in so they would not be so scratchy.  Eh.   Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes. Bottom line  I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,0
good for her,Another great Fancy Feast product!. My 12 year old finicky eater calico cat eats almost exclusively Fancy Feast products (wet and dry). Flavors are great  texture and size of the morsels are perfect for her. This chicken variety is one of her favorites and I keep her dish filled with it all the time (to eat when the urge hits). I have had no troubles with UTIs or anything else since she has been eating this. I love that I can give her a food that she loves that is good for her as well. Of course  this is not quite as good as boutique brand foods (health-wise) but she loves this and I am happy to give her what she will eat.,0

sturdier headset,Decent entry-level headset.. I ordered these for my son  who regularly Skypes with friends while they play together on private Minecraft servers. He likes that the headphones are light and comfortable  but says they do little to block out noise. He also has trouble with the microphone  as it only works intermittently. When he doesn't need the mic  it does easily flip up and out of the way  which is convenient for him. This headset will work for him for now  but I imagine as he gets more serious into his gaming  he'll opt for a sturdier headset that does more to block out the household noise around him.,0

"""zinc oxide""","this is a medium tint- definitely gives sun kissed glow  absorbs well  hydrates  non greasy. Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says  ""medium"" in the product description  which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level  so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle  BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink  with cool undertones. Still  I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in  but it gives me a slight tanned look  ""a sun kissed glow"".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..  This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen  using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays  converts them to heat  then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available  blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great  and it depends on what works best with  your skin.  This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious  skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter  jojoba  oilve oil  and vitamin e. It comes out thin  and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round  and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often  sweating it off  etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized  I feel better about keeping it so simple.  Again  I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the ""medium"" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a ""sun kissed glow"". If that is at all appealing to you  then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool  fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast  at all. If your skin is real oily  then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy  and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.  My skin: mid 40s  leans dry  semi sensitive  non-acne Rosacea (redness  visible veins)  I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year  and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else  it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot  and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck  then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try  and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).  I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new  or think of anything else.",1

closet full of clothes from Calvin Klein,Good Calvin Klein fragrance  long-lasting and pleasantly (although strong) scented. This is a fairly strong scented fragrance for woman.

color,100% cotton! Yay!!!!!. This duvet set is a serious bubble gum girly pink.  After raising 5 kids and 25 years of marriage I am single and have seriously declared independence in my bedroom that is going seriously pastel! LOL.  The only problem with that is 2 small dogs who like to run in my muddy garden  but the cotton washes great and gets softer with every washing which is the thing I love most about cotton.  I love that this duvet has a zipper too!  The only drawback I’ve found and that will be super easy for me to fix since I sew is that the ties inside are made of a very cheap fabric in my opinion. They came a bit frayed  but next time I am at the local Joann’s Fabric store I will pick up some twill tape or other material to replace the ties. The big irony is that I currently have a mint colored comforter inside of the duvet as I recently moved and have not unpacked my duvet insert yet.  I also like the little girly ruffle that is on 3 sides of the comforter.  Yes  I am a 52 year old woman with a bubble gum pink duvet cover and I’m loving it!,1
ridiculous marriage portrayal,A great career while it lasted. Finally settled in last night to watch this movie. Let me start by saying that I love a good mystery and that I usually enjoy these kind of movies. Not much more can I say that hasn't been said before. First  the acting was absolutely awful. The movie is so scripted  it's almost as if the actors are reading their lines. The roles and characters are more than predictable (i.e. you have all token nationalities in the 'bad guy' gang  so they are equal opportunity offenders). I found most of the action in the fight scenes to be totally absurd. I could no more see Kim B. slinging a tire iron at someone (and getting it lodged in the victim's nostrils) then my mother doing it. It was almost comical. The underlying piece of Kim's marriage to an abusive man  was also ridiculously scripted and acted (damn  if any housewife kept a house as dirty and junk filled as she did  who wouldn't be yelling at her from time to time?). Anyway  just reliving this movie to write this review is painful. The movie was like a bad Saturday Night Live/MadTV skit. Run  don't walk  from buying or even renting this one.,0

Eva Longoria seems a bit out of her league,Better Than Average. There are so many mediocre movies out there that just aren't that good.  I thought this was a cut above that.  Sure it's a bit predictable and it's not exactly non-stop action that takes your breath away  but it has an interesting plot and it moves along well.  The actors all do a good job and are convincing in their roles.  Eva Longoria seems a bit out of her league and her character doesn't develop into that much  but she sure is easy on the eyes.  She's okay  but they could have done a bit more with her character.  It's not a 5-star movie  but there was never a boring moment for me.  Do you want to own it? perhaps not.  Probably better as a one time rental  although it's entertaining enough to watch over again  once in a while.,0

enjoyed borrowing the magazines for my daughter when she was small,A great magazine for teachers and little kids. Ladybug is full of useful resources for early childhood teachers and the material is useful even if the magazines are out of date. The ideas in the magazines can be modified for use in the classroom. I teach children from kindergarten to year three  so I need a wide range of suitable materials. Since I am also a parent  I really enjoyed borrowing the magazines for my daughter when she was small. She loved the magazines and when she grew out of them  she graduated to 'Cricket' which is the magazine that follows on from 'Ladybug'.Since 'Ladybug' contains lots of activities  stories and songs  it doesn't take long to build up a useful library of resources. What's more! The activities are age appropriate and they all work.,1
reduced volume,French Press works better. I was so excited to use this for cold brew since I love so many OXO products  but this was a disappointment. I’ve been making cold brew in a French press until now  and I have been pleased with the results  but since it requires hands on filtering  I thought this OXO system would simplify the filtering and allow the machine to do most of the work. Wrong. With a French Press  once the coffee has brewed  I can press the coffee and separate most of the grounds from the cold brew. Then I slowly pour it out into a mesh filter lined with a paper filter and wait for it to slowly seep through. I have to change the paper filter half way through before pouring the second half. With this OXO system  you are supposed to be able to flip the switch and the cold brew will drip down in to the glass carafe below. But the grounds kept clogging the filter and then absolutely no liquid could get through. (I will also note that I have a quality conical burr grinder  so the grind should not be an issue.) I had to stand over it for about 15 min scraping the grounds to the side or scooping spoonfuls of grounds out of the brewing container. After 15 minutes of this  we were left with roughly 2/3 of the volume of cold brew we would have gotten from the same recipe in a French press. The reduced volume was partially due to me scooping grounds out of the way and throwing them in the sink  and partially because there was no way to effectively press the liquid out of the grounds. Also the taste was inferior. Again probably because the most concentrated cold brew couldn’t be pressed out of the grounds. Overall the taste was nowhere as good and the process was more cumbersome than a French press. I wish I loved this machine  but on the plus side  it’s one less thing to sit on my counter and take up more space in the fridge.,0
stronger than the rubber types,Decent if you’ve never worked out before.. It’s a little stronger than the rubber types you can get but too long to do much with it but what you are able to do with it aren’t hard workouts with this band. Not worth your money.,1
fit great,soft!!!. these are so soft and fit great!! we are huge copper pearl fans and will continue to buy from them forever!,1
last well,Nice Cotton Boxer Briefs. These have nearly everything I look for in boxer briefs.  They are tagless  comfortable  nice fitting  and look nice.  The only thing that is missing is a fly hole which is a bit annoying  but forgiveable if everything else is good.  And everything else is good.  I have put two through the wash and they look good and given the quality feel of them  I would expect that they will last well.,1
Great story,The chronicles of Narnia: prince of caspian. Great story and good for kids over age 7 in my opinion.  My 7 year old grandson is really into the series.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - nearly 6 000 reviews posted  viewed over 50 000 times  and over 24 000 likes.,1
best tool,Super oily and extremely sharp be careful.. At first I really didn't like how oily they were stacked together. I literally sliced my thumb open on the first one I was trying to take off the pile. I sliced my thumb again as I was trying to wipe the oily residue off before loading the rotary cutter. So use and clean with a lot of care. I was on a time crunch to complete a project and didn't have the time for the accidents my first attempt caused me. 😂  However  as long as you are careful and use cautious care they were a great buy for a little price. I will purchase these again when I finish using all that came in the pack.  I did ask a quilter friend that regularly uses her cuter and wheels why they needed to be so gross with oil. I was told that it has to do with how many come in the stack and to keep them very sharp while being tossed about during the moving  handling  and shipping. I don't know if her answer is the reason or not but it did make sense to me.  Just handle with extreme care always. Do not let young children use a rotary cutter. And don't let teens that can barely cut with scissors use either. (I'm not being funny with the teen part they will hurt themselves.) Take my word for it. I had teens helping with the project. Only responsible people should use these extremely helpful tool! This was the best tool (along with the self healing mat) I was ever gifted!,1
good leggings for all types of workouts,Runs a Bit Small. These are good leggings for all types of workouts. The fabric is very soft and stretchy. There's good tummy control. The waistband may roll down a bit while doing some exercises. The fit runs a bit small. I sized up for comfort.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1
hollow,Not bad!. So I got this with the intent to play Super Mario Odyssey. I received this and the official Pro Controller around the same time and  while I much prefer playing with the Pro Controller because of many reasons  I still use this one for other games besides Odyssey.  The feel of this one is a bit on the light side. It's hollow  though I suspect that's for any lack of vibration. The buttons are nice and clicky  more so than the ones on the Pro Controller  and I actually prefer the buttons on this one. However  because of the slightly wider (larger?) size  the shoulder buttons may be slightly more difficult to reach than the Pro Controller. The thumbsticks are longer  which I do not like for platformers and racing games. They may be good for FPS games  but I find there are far more genres of games on the Switch than FPS.  The back buttons are a nice addition  though I hardly ever use them. I've programmed them to duplicate L and R and thought I'd use them more often  but I don't. They work well enough and are positioned so as not to be in the way of accidental presses  but are within reach if necessary.  The texture is a nice matte feel  so no sweaty palms.  Overall  a great controller if you're looking for one on the budget.,0
pales in comparison to last year's forza,The ruined a once great game.. This forza is among my most disappointing games of the year. It pales in comparison to last year's forza. They literally included none of the great aspects of the last game.  I returned it within 2 days. Don't waste any money on this game.,0
"""retractable""","Nice pencil. Im not sure what they mean by "" retracktable"" because once the lead point comes out you cant make it go back in. There are a nice variety of colors in the box. I like how each pencil has 3 more leads stored inside itself. The gripper feels good in my hand and is easy to write with. As with any pencil like this  you cant press down too hard as you write because the lead will break.",0
scrambled eggs with oysters,A gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!. When I think of Malaysian dishes  it’s the spicy  layered flavors of Norman Musa’s “Amazing Malaysian” that I think of. It opens with street food and snacks  and moves on to seafood  meat  vegetables  rice and noodles  pudding and drinks  and the Malaysian pantry. Gorgeous photos of street scenes in Malaysia pepper the pages  while the gold-embossed cover looks great sitting out on a table or countertop.  You'll find street snack favorites like chicken satay  net pancakes  roti canai  and fried spring rolls  along with Indian lentil patties  grilled fish paste in banana leaf  tofu stuffed with crunchy vegetables  and the gorgeous Kak Besah’s curry puffs. The seafood dishes reminded me of many preparations I had last year while working in Taiwan whole fish steamed with lemongrass  ginger and chilies  squid stir fry  and scrambled eggs with oysters. The meat dishes featured are mostly chicken and beef (no pork unlike Ping’s book)  with lamb curry  beef rendang  and numerous chicken dishes.  One of my new favorite recipes is the Nyonya Vermicelli Noodle Salad  which features rice noodles  tofu beansprouts  and ginger with plenty of lime juice and fresh herbs (if you are vegetarian  leave out the shrimp paste and prawns). I also loved the Malay Vegetable Dhal Curry  pumpkin in turmeric and coconut milk  and eggs in chili sambal (think shakshuka).  Rice and noodle dishes include tomato rice (nasi tomato)  wok-fried flat noodles  curry laksa  chicken rice  herbal rice  and several egg-fried rices in addition to fried noodles. Desserts range from the effortless (fresh mango  honey and coconut  tropical fruit salad) to the more elaborate (pandan custard and sticky rice layered sweet  sticky rice balls  soy panna cotta with passion fruit and crushed chocolate cookies. And you’ll find any number of refreshing drinks  from lemongrass and honey tea and rose syrup drink to pulled sweet tea and iced fresh lime juice.  At the end are several staple condiments  from the ubiquitous chili paste and ginger soy sauce  to sambals (chili  coconut)  sauces  and vegetable pickles.  Norman Musa’s recipes tend to be a bit more advanced but also result in more complex  nuanced flavors. This is a gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!,0
only use it when he is outside for brief periods of time,Really like the tone. Really like the tone  should have purchased the mallet.

brush is hefty and is one solid piece,Good  hefty brush but short handle massaging side not useful to me. I tried several brushes over the last several months and love the KOZIS Wooden Bath Brush (Amazon item # B08HR2GBHC) the best. However  this one is very good too.  The brush head side is ample for good coverage. The bristles are of medium softness. The massaging side is not useful to me because I have no desire to use that. In fact  I do not even understand why anyone would use that.   The brush is hefty and is one solid piece  which is fabulous as the head cannot fall off the handle like some other brushes I tried previously. It also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower. In addition  a self-stick hook is supplied if needed but I did not use it.  Besides the massaging brush head that I find useless  the only negative to me is that the brush handle is about two inches shorter than I would like. Many brushes have a longer handle and a longer handle is best when trying to reach my back. Nevertheless  this is still very functional and it is very well made.  Overall  I like this brush even though it comes in second to the KOZIS I love. The current price of $11.99 is about right for a two-sided wooden brush.,1
no full refund on returns,Don't bother. Bypass this option for an American company version. It was very disappointing  inaccurately described  and no full refund on returns.,0
bargain basement travel set,PU case really smells brushes are okay two brush heads frayed. There are 14 brushes in this set. There are brushes for foundation  blush  eyeshadow  eye blending (fan brush)  etc. In fact  there are more brushes than I needed.   The one unique brush in this set (see photo) is the one that looks like a paint brush. This is perfect for cheek highlighting.  The bristles are relatively soft but not as soft as I expected. They feel pretty good against my skin but not great. Also  the heads have a slight odor. The PU brush case has a tremendous chemical odor and needs to be aired out a while.  This is a bargain basement travel set for someone who is starting their make-up journey. The current price of $11.19 comes to $.80 cents per brush. In this case one gets what they pay for it's a marginal price for a marginal quality set that is functional. ,0
She loves it,Runner necklace. Very cute necklace. Bought for a gift to a Runner. She loves it,1
listening skills,Solid instrument that can help with not only time  but dynamics and listening skills. I received this as a free review sample. Since there are a number of very detailed reviews I am going to stick to how I use it as a drummer.  First  if you are practicing dynamics  this is an excellent tool. Of course it's designed to develop a sense of time  but it produces a beat in the 60 dB range at one meter. For a drummer this is somewhere in the P to PP range  so if you combine time keeping exercises with dynamics  this is an invaluable tool that I suspect most drummers will overlook because it's based on a design that is literally hundreds of years old. Trust me  this is effective. Moreover  since it is not incredibly loud it reinforces listening skills. I used this for a solid week in my practice room before writing this review and can make the claim that if you are a trained drummer this metronome has the potential to improve your dynamics  listening and time.  A nice thing is this is not as delicate as the old style metronomes upon which the design is based. It's not a toy and does need to be treated with care  but I owned a much older instrument that was temperamental and did not like being moved or handled much. This one is more robust.  Bottom line: if you are uncertain if this will be loud enough  download a copy of [[ASIN:B0054KJND6 Decibel-O-Meter Free]] and measure your own instrument's sound pressure level at one meter and determine if this metronome will be loud enough. For some instruments it may not be  but for many like an acoustic piano  guitar  etc. it will be. For folks like me this works for certain exercises like those I mentioned and it is a lot more pleasant than some of the electronic metronomes I have tried.,1
easy to follow instructions,Simple to set up. Just received product. But instructions are very easy to follow,1
the writing was complex honest factual and complete,Five well earned stars... I loved book one. Lissy and Luke's story captured my attention and I couldn't stop reading. I didn't think the second book of the series could be much better but.. it was. Matt and Brook's story was just as amazing but different. Matt and Brooklyn were friends for over two years because Brooklyn was afraid of losing her best friend. Matt patiently waited for the woman that he knew was the one. Although the plot read like a typical love story the execution was superb. The writing was complex  honest  factual and complete. I didn't have the urge to slam my kindle against the wall because of grammatical errors  piecemeal writing or undeveloped characters. This book is print worthy and if you're an e-book reader you should understand what that is... I would give up a section of my bookcase to a print copy of this series. I like this author and respect her writing style therefore I will be picking up book three. Recommended but start with Book 1.,1
easy to swallow,Great daily vitamin for the older woman's body!. This is my new favorite daily vitamin. Totally Vegan  easy to swallow and fills all the daily requirements of my 60+aged body. I have a tendency to skip breakfast most days a week and this vitamin agrees with an empty stomach (no aftertaste  burping  or unpleasant stomach rumblings). This is a lot cheaper than my usual Centrum formula so Amazon has once again turned me away from name brands and over to their store brand names. I highly recommend for any woman over age 40 who cares about their health!,1
inflexible,"Decent  But Expensive Not Fully Functional on New Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" Tablet. CROSSWORDS by Standalone is a decent crossword puzzle app  but inflexible and expensive.  On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet  the working display shows about two-thirds of a weekday NY Times puzzle grid  and I can't find any way to resize the grid to show the whole puzzle at once. (You must swipe down or hit an arrow button to reveal the lower one-third of the grid.)  The Across and Down clues appear alongside the grid in a readable typeface  but the clues are cut off at the right.  (Perhaps this is an 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD issue that the developer will correct fortunately  clicking on a cut-off clue will display the full clue below the grid.)  The puzzle hints--found under the list icon beside the app icon  at the left--don't always work as expected.  For example  ""reveal entire puzzle"" only filled in one word (for the 1-down clue) when I started from the ""hints for 1-down"" screen.  In contrast  ""reveal entire puzzle"" filled in the entire puzzle when I started from a ""press-and-hold-on-clue"" popup.  Worse  the general settings for navigation (e.g.  ""skip filled squares""  ""show mistakes"") don't seem to function at all.  (Perhaps this is another Kindle Fire HD issue for the developer to fix.)  The app allows you to enter multiple letters in a single square  and to look up puzzle info (must-haves for NY Times crossword solvers).  If you are a NY Times crosswords subscriber  the app will automatically download the daily puzzles for you.  The app comes with an assortment of puzzles already installed  and allows you to browse for and download many more puzzles from the Internet.  It also allows you to establish an account and compare your times with other solvers.  However  the FREE [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] app does nearly all of the same things.  (Crosswords Plus does not download your NY Times subscription puzzles automatically  although it makes it easy to download them daily it doesn't come with puzzles loaded  although it points you to free Internet sources and it doesn't have a feature for comparing scores with other solvers.)  In addition  [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] allows you to resize the grid  offers an alternate clues-only view  includes the usual hints options  and has navigational settings (skipping boxes  etc.) that are fully functional on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet.  Even if this CROSSWORDS app worked perfectly  I would still prefer [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]].  For this reason  and because of the high price and current Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet issues  I rate CROSSWORDS at 3 stars.",0
interesting way of pronouncing MUSIC,"Disappointing Debut Album. What were they thinking to put out an album like this from the man who wants to sing opera?  This is an odd assortment of songs with only Nessun Dorma from opera.  And what's with singing pop songs in Italian?  Did they not have enough opera songs that Paul was good at so that they had to take other songs that he knew and make them sound like opera?  Then to include the hymns (O Holy Night and Silent Night)  which Paul does okay with  but have been done far better by many singers.  The worst stinker on the album is the Spanish version of My Way.  Also Paul has an interesting way of pronouncing MUSIC.  He sings ""Moo-Sick""  rather that ""Mew-Sick"" as most of us say it in the song Music of the Night.  Paul has a way of going deep into the soul (or something like that) and bringing people to tears with his songs. (Yes  me too.)  He is not the best singer  but with that way of getting to people in a very deep way  he will succeed.  Give the man 10 stars  but this recording doesn't rate much more than 3 or 4.  It's a shame and I truly hope this is not the ""one chance"" for Paul Potts to shine.  I honestly believe he will shine if they do a good job on future albums.",0
instructions,Need expertise to install. I've kept this for months because I like the IDEA of it  but you have to drill  through your roof and put in an outside antenna.  It's way too complex so it's still in the box.  Looks well made.  Instructions might as well be in a foreign language.  Electrician won't install it due to drilling through roof.  So .....,0
fantastic songs,Awesome hard rock cd!. I absolutely love this cd.  The songs are well crafted and performed flawlessly by the band. The guitars are phenomenal   from the riffs to solos.  Drums too. No &#34hit&#34 songs but every song is fantastic.,1
country,little bit of rock  a little bit of country and a little bit of rap. it is funny  how within one song you can get a real mix of composition!  for a new comer  she has a great voice and like a review before  she definately has a bit of carrie underwood  a bit of pussycat  and a little bit of Wyonna too.  The lyrics are definately more country orientated.  Strong voice  great music beat and many of the songs  I couldnt help tapping my feet and I am going to incorporate many of songs in my personal spinning exercise program.  Definately a good album to play in an open car!,1
Copper synth and Silver synth removed from application,Great for new users  lousy for upgraders. In the past I have used several versions of Magix Music Maker  including version 7  2005  and 10. Each has been a steady progression of improvement and capability  so I was quite eager to see how much new stuff was added when I upgraded from version 10 to version 14. I was surprised not so much by the new capabilities but by how much has been removed.  The overall application is similar to Sony Acid or even Audacity - it is a loop-based music composition and production tool. The main production board allows for up to 96 tracks  which is a generous amount and should be plenty for all but the most complex and lengthy of tracks. There are a large number of production tools that allow for all manner of effects and edits  giving a near limitless supply of tweaks and edits that can be made to a track.  The new interface (as compared to version 10 which is my reference point) is sleek and user friendly  although the learning curve for an application of this type is understandably steep. Most functions are relatively straightforward  but some do require a jaunt through the user manual which is included in PDF form in the installation directory.  There is a generous supply of good-quality loops  though users of previous versions have seen some of these in the past. For a new user  though  there's a lot to choose from.  The VSTi interface is vastly improved and updated  making it not only a lot more user friendly but a lot more stable too. A new synth is included  the Vita. This supposedly take place of the guitar and grand piano synths  though I have not worked enough with it to replicate those sounds. I have monkeyed with it enough to make some interesting sounds  though  and overall I think it's a good synth.  Magix has done a nice job of better integrating their tools  which is a step forward. The only problem there is that sometimes users of previous versions may struggle to find some of the tools they want or need. Such is the case with me  though I found most of what I sought. Most - not all. This is where I noticed something unpleasant.  Music Maker 10 came with a wonderful tool called the Music Editor  which is a waveform editor with some other useful functions. I used this more than Music Maker itself. I was anxious to see how it had changed and when I looked for it I could not find it. What I did find  in the help file  was an occasional reference to it including a menu selection for locating it. The selection did not exist. After digging deeper I found that Magix stripped out the Music Editor and it is available as an upgrade to the Producer Edition - which you can ONLY get through the Magix website. Another $30 and you can have what used to be included.  Also gone are the Copper synth and the Silver synth. I used to use the Copper quite frequently and that one will be missed. I do not understand why it was removed  having been in the application for many iterations.  For a new user  Music Maker 14 packs a lot of goodies into the package and is a great starting point. For upgraders  though  it is a disappointment  with the smell of being a play for additional fees (much like activating the MP3 plug-in). This will be my last Magix purchase  based on the change in packaging and pricing  though I like the program itself. Hopefully Magix will realize that alienating long-standing customers is a poor strategy and will include the missing pieces in the regular edition again.,0

stocking stuffers for my two daughter-in-laws,Great way to scrub and exfoliate!. I have been using scrubs in the shower for the past few years. I have really dry  crepey skin and scrubs really help. I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw these cubes  couldn't figure out if I would be able to control it in the shower (trying to get it onto my legs and arms). I was pleasantly surprised  however  to see how easy it was.  As I begin to use it the cube stays in the palm of my hand and begins to 'melt' slowly as I moved it up and down my arms and legs. There was plenty to go around and it was super easy to use. My skin felt amazing after just one use. I really did like the fragrance  too. I will be buying a few more of these for myself and also as stocking stuffers for my two daughter-in-laws (a unique gift). Highly recommend!,1

wonderful job writing,A Book That Stirs Memories.... Occasionally I finish a book that leaves me not wanting begin another  at least for a little while  because it really stays with me .I did not want to ruin the stirring feelings I had upon completing Nine  Ten. (This is out of the ordinary for me  as I normally start on another book the minute I finish one.)  It took me back to Before...My boys were four and two...and I remembered how different America was when they were small on September 10th...before.   Nine  Ten reminded me of what it's like to read historical fiction  good historical fiction  about the Titanic. When an author does as wonderful a job writing about a major event as Baskin does  you do not want to stop reading  even though you know what's coming. Even the author notes and  the acknowledgements  were heart- rending.   I have already recommended Nine  Ten to several people. I think this book would be a wonderful way to teach others about 9-11.It will probably be a nostalgia trip for parents of today  most of whom will remember Before...and how it was so different.,1

atmosphere draws the player into the park,"""Haunted Carousel"" an entertaning ride.. In ""The Haunted Carousel "" teenage sleuth Nancy Drew is on her eighth case: investigating amusement park ""hauntings"" in Captains Cove  NJ. One of the park's famed carousel horses has been stolen  and the carousel has been mysteriously starting and stopping on its own. Also  the park's roller coaster stopped suddenly  causing a rider to injure his neck. With the park shut down  Nancy must interview the employees and explore the park to find clues. ""Haunted Carousel"" has some nice improvements over past games: the addition of the ""to do"" list  journal  and cell phone (no more endless running back and forth to Nancy's hotel to call). If Nancy gets stuck  she can call her friends Bess and George and the Hardy Boys. The game has two levels  Junior and Senior Detective  and there are plenty of built-in tips and hints  including a park operating manual with an overview of most puzzle components. ""Haunted Carousel"" seemed to be one of the easier ND games. ""Haunted Carousel"" really draws the player into the park's atmosphere  complete with hotel room service  arcade games  a ride on the carousel (and chance to grab the brass ring)  and more. The storyline flowed smoothly  the puzzles were organic (programming an arcade game  switching roller coaster tracks  repairing the carousel's band organ  reading invisible ink)  the voice work was above average and the characters had distinct personalities. Music was pronounced  including carnival music for the carousel and ominous creepy tunes for the haunted house. Nancy must watch her step as always  since someone wants to stop her from finding out the truth behind the hauntings. Along the way she helps someone come to terms with the past  sniffs out an insurance fraud  and digs up long-lost truths and secrets about the park and its employees. This is a lovely adventure with a unique atmosphere that will delight young sleuths.",1
paper quality,300 sheet drawing pad. My 7 year old is a budding artist - for real - this pad is a godsend.  He can draw and draw and follow his inspirations each day - leaving each piece in place to review later with the spiral binding.  I love these pads.  You get 3 pads.  That will keep him busy for a few months. The paper is good paper quality  artist quality.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new inf seem useful.,1
not what is shown on the picture,hate it.. Unlike the picture this thing is about the size of a quarter and broke the first time I used it. Don't bother getting it. It is not what is shown on the picture and it was only one tiny  tiny thing that never worked. Waste of money.,0
best of collections,"The mother of all motherships. Led Zeppelin lent inspiration to hundreds of bands  not to mention millions of listeners.  Mothership is the motherlode collection of the band's incredible legacy.  Beautifully packaged and sounding fantastic  this two-disc set includes pretty much all the highlights  touching upon every one of the band's original albums.  A favorite or two might be missing  of course  but that's true of any (all?) ""Best of"" collections  yes?  Five blimps flying high and strong from me.",1
works considerably well,Great portable flosser. This portable flosser works considerably well. I took it with me on a trip to visit my grandkids recently. It packs easily and does the job of getting loose food particles between my teeth. To be honest  I also have a Sonicare flosser that has a much stronger water flow which I do prefer  but this is a lesser expensive way to get the job done and it is a handy size for traveling. So  I will be using this one when I am on the go as a way to maintain my oral health.,1
must have for new puppy people,Must have for new puppy people. Awesome!,1
thumbsticks,Not bad!. So I got this with the intent to play Super Mario Odyssey. I received this and the official Pro Controller around the same time and  while I much prefer playing with the Pro Controller because of many reasons  I still use this one for other games besides Odyssey.  The feel of this one is a bit on the light side. It's hollow  though I suspect that's for any lack of vibration. The buttons are nice and clicky  more so than the ones on the Pro Controller  and I actually prefer the buttons on this one. However  because of the slightly wider (larger?) size  the shoulder buttons may be slightly more difficult to reach than the Pro Controller. The thumbsticks are longer  which I do not like for platformers and racing games. They may be good for FPS games  but I find there are far more genres of games on the Switch than FPS.  The back buttons are a nice addition  though I hardly ever use them. I've programmed them to duplicate L and R and thought I'd use them more often  but I don't. They work well enough and are positioned so as not to be in the way of accidental presses  but are within reach if necessary.  The texture is a nice matte feel  so no sweaty palms.  Overall  a great controller if you're looking for one on the budget.,0
turn for the better,Rich but sad story. The writing was wonderful. The story was often heartbreaking and then a turn for the better would help me to the next chapter. I'm glad I read it  but wished I hadn't stopped and started with it so much.,1
great quick healthy recipes,I really enjoy this magazine over others. I get tons of women's magazines.  Most of them I don't need or just flip through them.  I find this one I actually read cover to cover. I find so many things in this magazine that is interesting and fun.  Some Great quick healthy recipes too. If you have to cut down and get fewer magazines in you home   this one is the one to stay with! Informative.  Good articles  good pics  and the recipes are great.,1
older and will expire at the end of the year,This planner is an older version  be aware that it is for 2019. This is a nice planner  but it is older and will expire at the end of the year.  It is not a good value even if it was for this year and next.  It's basically a notebook with a calendar pages.  I would value it at no more than $12.,0
size of a quarter,hate it.. Unlike the picture this thing is about the size of a quarter and broke the first time I used it. Don't bother getting it. It is not what is shown on the picture and it was only one tiny  tiny thing that never worked. Waste of money.,0
content is heavy on paint color samples,Lacks interesting content. One of the most worthless magazines I have ever subscribed to. It's the same ol'  same ol' issue after issue. It's content is heavy on paint color samples  and little else. Don't waste your money.,0
comfortable for me,Feels and works exactly like every other disposable mask I tried. These 3-ply masks look  feel  and work like every other disposable blue mask I have tried. There is wire along the nose area so that I can mold this to my face. The pleats allow me to expand this until it is relatively snug under my chin and along the sides. The ear elastics fit nicely over my ears. Overall  these are comfortable for me.  Buying this brand or any other brand all comes down to the price. The current price of $6.64 ($6.99 minus 5%) is extremely reasonable for 50 masks.,1
not fully opaque in bright light,"Easy-To-Wear Dress. I love a dress that you can just throw on and look like you spent precious time getting ready. This dress is so easy to wear. It's basically a fancy t-shirt. The fabric is lightweight and has stretch. There's an attached tie belt for cinching and cuffs at the sleeves. The pockets are just a fun bonus. The fabric is not fully opaque in bright light as you might be able to see in my picture. It's not a big deal for me. I found the fit to be true to size. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the medium. I highly recommend this dress.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",0
Mia's father was a serial killer,No spoilers. Four solid stars for a good plot. Great writing and the characters are believable. The summary is pretty spot on. Mia's father was a serial killer who tortured his daughter which drove her to take his life. Vin who is 18 years her senior falls for her after the customary tug and pull. A lot happens in between but that's the general idea. A worthy read.,0
feel good,Its a wonderful life and White Christmas set. I really only purchase streaming movies to own any more.... but these are a gift for a family who doesn't own them. These are really two of the best holiday films.  Good  positive  feel good about life holiday movies.  Well worth the investment to own for sure.  I am sure the family gifted them to will love them.,1
website navigation,Such cuties!. I absolutely love these little dolls. To be honest  I gave them to my niece to play with and she wouldn't put them down. After watching her navigate to the website (absolutely incredible for a 4 year old to be this computer literate)  I was sold on this doll. I really would love to own these myself  lol. You can't go wrong with this as a stocking stuffer  add on gift  or a quick little reward for good grades or work. I love them and they will provide hours of fun for your child.,1
fits in my shoe perfectly,These are the best lower back pain relief insoles around!. I am on my feet all day with my job and I tend to wear some kind of heel (whether it's a wedge or a 2 inch heel). I need support and cushioning or  by the end of the day  I have terrible lower back and heel pain. I found these Pain Relief Orthotics earlier this year and I am so glad I did. Light weight  fits in my shoe perfectly for my size 9 feet  and definitely makes a major difference by the end of the day in the way my back feels. I am sure I will never be able to get rid of all the pain  but with these Dr. Scholl's insoles  I feel refreshed and not like I used to. I highly recommend these for any one on their feet (waitresses  bartenders  sales associates  etc) and I know your feet (and back) will thank you.,1
drops format not preferred,It didn't really work for me  but the ingredients show it might work for others. Rating as 3 stars because  after taking this for several weeks now  I am not  seeing the results I was expecting. My nails especially send to be brittle and weak (probably because of years of wearing acrylic nails). I was really hoping that taking this would eliminate the need for me to use special nail polish for nail hardening. It didn't. I still see my nails in the same condition. This may work for others  but it didn't for me. Maybe I need to take it for several months  unsure  but I didn't want to buy another bottle if I didn't see it at least starting to work. I also don't care for the drops with this and having to drink it. Would have preferred a pill format.,0
didn't last at all,worked for a while and then quit. Not worth the money  didn't last at all.  Sorry I purchased.,0
no type of control built in,Attractive swimsuit with easy closing neck clasp but the bra inserts do not say put. This is an attractive suit that I found just a bit tricky to get into. I like the easy closing clasp around the neck. The straps in the back can get a bit tangled when putting this on but straighten out once pulled up to the neckline. This suit does not have any type of control built in  so one's shape shows as is--fully tummy and all. What I do not like is the bra inserts. On the one I received  the right insert kept folding over and it was difficult to straighten out. Personally  I do not like inserts of any kind in a bathing suit or bra. However  if they stayed in place that would be acceptable  but these do not. It is mainly for this reason that an otherwise attractive suit is a disappointment to me.  The label recommends hand washing only and line drying. I always machine wash items like this in a lingerie bag and hang dry.,0
local stores only carry them seasonally,As advertised.. Husband bought for greenhouse and reports they work great and as expected.  They are one of those things you need extras of apparently and the local stores only carry them seasonally.  So Amazon to the rescue!,0
gift card is convenient to pay at Logan,Logan's food is cheaper than Outback and tastes better than Applebee. The gift card is convenient to pay at Logan and especially a 20% discount on prime day. Logan's food is cheaper than Outback and tastes better than Applebee.,1
black dog on the game,My daughter loves it she's a black dog on the game. My daughter loves it good game🐶🐶🐶🐶,1
feels heavy,Average. Overall I like this bouffant. The fabric is thick and it is well made it fits well. I purchased it when I was working in the COVID unit. I have long hair and throughout the day it would fall apart and feels heavy  pulling and irritating my scalp. I am sure all the girls with long hair know what I am talking about. This bouffant has enough space to fit all of my hair inside without a hair tie. Being able to avoid touching my hair in a 12-16hr shift is a big plus. However  I am rating it 3 stars... because the color faded dramatically after just 1 wash  1 drying cycle. It's soooo faded now...  I recommend this product  just avoid dark color  so the fading is not too obviouse.,0
Not enough power,Two Stars. when I applied a little pressure the wheel stopped spinning. Not enough power.,0
fit runs a bit small,Runs a Bit Small. These are good leggings for all types of workouts. The fabric is very soft and stretchy. There's good tummy control. The waistband may roll down a bit while doing some exercises. The fit runs a bit small. I sized up for comfort.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,0
functioning now,Mighty Mule Gate. We had a 20 year old might mule gate that FINALLY gave out - we live on the oceanfront in northern Oregon.  So  we purchased a new Mighty Mule.  Because this one is new and updated  it did take my husband (who had electrical skills) about 1/2 a day to install.  Then a new method of training the clickers and autos - but all is functioning now and it is strong and sturdy.  Hopefully it will last long as the first one.  In all fairness  with the old one we did replace the batteries and a couple of various pieces of the 20 years - but these are things that you expect. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
Packaged well,Five Stars. So pretty & dainty.  Packaged well.  Gave them to my teo granddaughters,1
words to the music,Fun. This song is just fun.  From the words to the music.  It is very lyrical as far as the singing goes.  It is just fun and relatable.,1
viewed over 50000 times,50 blank coupon cards. These are very pretty and work well for about anything you're trying to coupon.  Heavy card stock.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - nearly 6 000 reviews posted  viewed over 50 000 times  and over 24 000 likes. I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,1
sticky,I really hope this service and products improve in my next box!. I recieved 4 items plus a makeup bag with my first month of this subscription. The description of what is supposed to come in each months box clearly stated that there were supposed to be 5 (five) full sized products  consisting of all lip products and one random makeup item. I received a full sized lip liner  a normal sized lipstick and very small  what I would call sample size lip scrub and eyeshadow. They were extremely small. Also  the lipstick was smudge proof  but remained SO sticky the entire time I wore it. I mean  my lips kept sticking together and even stuck to my napkin when I wiped my mouth. I didn't like it. The price is not bad  and I'm going to continue my subscription for a few more months to see if the products improve  but if they remain consistently poor  then the value isn't actually good for the price and I will cancel.,0
snacks,WHAT THEY EAT OUTSIDE THE USA. Interesting to try their snacks but certainly nothing to write home about.  If price cut in half the value would get one more star.  If you do not mind spending the bucks and wonder what people in other countries eat then go for it.  Looking for great treats inexpensively - skip this.  I suspect sooner or later one country will come up with something that your taste buds will fall in love with but otherwise just enjoy the experience and don't have too many expectations.,0
remote is great,Love them. I love these. The remote is great and the options are awesome. Very bright and solor. So put them up and that's it. Buying more again.,1
comfortable,Simple headbands that loosely grip my headwish there were more color variety. There are 12 headbands in this set and practically all of them look a similar shade of pastel pink  purple  and yellow. Only one headband is bold with an emerald green. I would have liked a red  black  and brown in this set. However  this appears to be designed for young girls or ballerinas who would love these colors.  I tried these on and the headbands are comfortable and do not squeeze my head. They also stay put. I have a small head so these would probably feed a youngster just fine.  The current price of $15.99 comes to a reasonable $1.33 per headband.,1
low volume and tinny at max input,poor design. Poor design- speakers fire up & down in relation to ipod or only one speaker fires at you at 90* rotation. No power lite so easy to forget its on  low volume and tinny at max input. OK for a quiet environment but even low background noise will wash it out. Keep looking- there are better front firing units here for about $10 more- very well worth spending the extra money.,0
figure out the straps,A must-have for your earthquake kit!. These are great! I bought them for our earthquake kits and will buy more! In case there's a big one and aftershocks  have this handy in case of more falling objects. Great price as well. Took a few minutes to figure out the straps to put them together- then it was a breeze-  very happy with this purchase.,0
"small ""walking"" purse","Beautiful  well boxed/protected and arrived in PERFECT condition.. My handy man hung it up in my hallway yesterday and it's BEAUTIFUL! Exactly as I pictured. Just inside the front door  it's the perfect place for a jacket  the dog's leash and even my small ""walking"" purse. Beautiful!",1
easy to use,What a great device!. It’s easy to use  it shaves ice quickly and beautifully  and is a real bargain. I shave ice in the morning  put it in my insulated cup  and snack on it all day..,1
activate this card,I could not even activate this card. Some places accepted it and most didn't.. I dislike the fact that I may have been sold a fake card. I added it to my payment method on Amazon and Amazon won't even use it.,0
not for outdoor use,Big  loose and comfy. Not sure what I thought I was getting  but I wouldn't use these for outdoor (or even in the gym) use. They are super comfortable  baggy/loose and are great for sleeping or just lounging around the house. I don't like the waist band  found it keeps rolling down when I wear them (have to keep pulling them up). I think they are soft and comfy  but not for me for yoga or any other type of sport (unless I am going to use them in my home).,0
removing it from the packaging was difficult,Looks good. The product looks good and should protect the keyboard.  However  removing it from the packaging was difficult.,0
bottom is made of some kind of plastic,A slipping hazard. The shoe top fabric is nice but the bottom is made of some kind of plastic that reminds me of the wheels on a big wheel.  They are a fall hazard.  I wouldn't even donate them so as not to bring that on anyone else.  I actually threw them out and will be more careful in future orders.,0
lint tray is way too small,Excellent. This is an excellent fabric shaver.  Originally I purchased the [[ASIN:B0014UGDQA Evercare Giant Fabric Shaver 1 ea]] but that worked awful. I also tried [[ASIN:B001OXZB06 D-Fuzz-It DFuzzIt Sweater & Fabric Comb - Oak Hill Industries #DFUZ]] which was good but hard to clean the fuzz from.  However  this fabric shaver gets most pills / fuzz from your clothes.  Just lay the clothing out flat on a flat and stable surface and gently move it over the fabric.  My only complaint is that the lint tray is way too small for all the fuzz it will remove that you have to constantly empty it. Other than this it's a great purchase and is available for $9.99 at some Bed  Bath  and Beyond stores.  This unit takes two C size batteries  comes with a special ring for delicate fabrics  has a cover for when not in use  and comes with a lint brush to clean the cutting blades.  It is also easy to disassemble for cleaning.,0
not super quality,waterproof vinyl tablecloth. these are fair quality plastic table cloths  the best thing is the elastic edge all around the table  fits like a fitted sheet.  You'll need to smooth for a good fit  just like you do a fitted sheet. I am disappointed that they are not machine washable. They have a really crappy felt like material on the underside so if you did try to machine wash they would just become a ball. So  you do have to wipe them down and thoroughly dry for storage.  They are not super quality so you may get 2 or 3 uses if you are careful not to tear.  So for the price  maybe that is good enough.  I purchased 4  - and having said that I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,0
watering eyes,Contains a poisonous toxic chemical formaldehyde. I am highly allergic to formaldehyde   it cause me to be dizzy. Have headaches   watering eyes. Sore throat. I had all these things after using this hair condition one time. I read the remarks  and another person asked Amazon if there was formaldehyde in it  and they referred this person to the manufacturer. Located in Hong Kong   they gave the person the run around on the answer. And never did admit it. It is illegal to put it into anything here in the US. I was exposed to it through 2 different sets of sheets and one face cream. And now this hair conditioner. Ive contacted the manufacturer   but I doubt I'll hear from them!!,0
Best one I've tried,Five Stars. Best one I've tried.,1
magnet is not very strong,Weak Magnet. This charges a phone very quickly but that is about the only positive thing about it.  The magnet is not very strong at all.  Barely holds onto a 14 pro max with a MagSafe case on it.  Barely bumped the phone will fall.  Works a little better with a 14 mini.  The AirPod charger charges very slow even though it gets the AirPods very warm.,0
beautiful,large moon lamp-beautiful. I see the moon   the moon sees me...🔮and I love this lamp.  I’ve got several sizes -one on nightstand  one in living (next to my moon picture on wall) room and another in hallway.  Great conversation piece too!  And remote control is an extra bonus.  Thanks to the moon and back!,1
frating and ripped after 3 hours of wear,DONT BUY THESE!!! ABSOLUTELY JUNK PRODUCT!!!!. I JUST BOUGHT THESE  THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY JUNK!!! THEY'RE ALREADY FRATING AND RIPPED AFTER 3 HOURS OF WEAR  IM SO DISSAPONTED WITH THE POOR QUALITY!!! AVOID THESE,0
gift for my nephew,I'm sure he will love. I have had a subscription  but I cancelled it because I have too many mags. coming.  However  I found and old on  so I decided to subscribe again.  But this is a gift for my nephew  who loves  to cook.  I'm sure he will love it,1
Thorough guidance on travel for many budgets,Visual  intellectual  cultural treat!. It gives you a nice bite of France in more ways than you imagine. A treat for the eyes  and food for thought  both culturally and economically. Thorough guidance on travel for many budgets. Great ideas. Intellectually stimulating. It's fun to go back and review. Recipe tips  language tips  movie  music and book reviews. I love it!,1
thinner than I expected,Pretty green.  these are thinner than I expected. These are a soft pretty green.  They are thinner than I expected.  They're still nice.,0
low noise level,Nice. Low noise level and easy to use.,1
well-written,Pretty Predictable/Fairly Boring. I chose this from the library because the author wrote &#34Cages&#34  one of my favorites. It was not as well-written  possibly because it was for a younger audience. Kehret did not flavor with details like she usually does  and the characters did not seem very well developed. It kept my attention enough to finish  but not read again.,0
phone fell 2x,NOT A GOOD CASE TO PROTECT MY NEW S20+ ULTRA. Not a good case!  My phone fell 2x and both times my screen cracked.  I just bought a new case and screen protectors to cover the cracks.,0
upset with the quality,Grumbles. And here we have another product that I am still not thrilled with your hair and your hair is close to yourself and what happens when the plastic cap comes off the end and the metal snap and now you have a big chunk of metal poking you in the head yeah I'm not happy at all I have not even contacted the vendor because I don't want sound mean to them how upset I am with the quality that is not here. Replacement would be nice,0
doesn't prevent/treat redness,Smells good but doesn’t prevent/treat redness.. Smells so good but doesn’t seem to help prevent or treat diaper rash/redness. We have been using it for a few days now  trying to give it a chance but it doesn’t seem to be doing the trick.,0
"""great""",Good pricing. These are great I wish there were more natural options though,1
Easy to push and maneuver,Great value. For the price this is a great jogging stroller. It was very easy to setup. Directions were short and easy to follow. Up and running within 5-10 minutes. The seat doesn’t recline completely flat but enough for a child to sleep comfortably. Good legroom and comfortable ride. Easy to push and maneuver.,1
bear,Ordered a hedgehog  but received a bear with no stuffing. I received the wrong item and it wasn't a stuffed toy at all.  I received a flat item that was supposed to be stuffed.,0
2 ply,2 ply  not thick  and small size.. The boxes of Puffs came at a good time  as we are having allergies with a change of seasons..  These are 2 ply. I’m use to a 3 ply tissue that is softer then these Puffs. These felt thin and rougher then what I’m use too  but when I used one They seemed a bit thicker then what I expected  but Not a full size tissue. Rather on the small side. These small boxes Would be nice next to a bed in the guest bathroom  nursery   car etc.  If I had a cold this would not be the Tissue I would want to use. My husband was Not a fan of these.,0
light-handed treatments,Fantastic blend of complete menus  seasonality  and international flavors. My friend and James Beard Award-winning cookbook author Meike Peters recently released her latest cookbook “365: A Year of Everyday Cooking and Baking” and graciously sent a copy to me here in Japan  where I eagerly pored over the gorgeous food photography with its tantalizing  jewel-like salads.  Meike’s cooking is very much guided by the seasonal calendar  and in “365”  you’ll find a year’s worth of complete menus (including salads  soups  pasta  sandwiches  vegetables  seafood  meat and sweets) that make the most of seasonal produce  marrying them with a range of international influences including hearty German fare  Middle Eastern  and Mediterranean flavors and inspirations.  With the falling of the leaves and the arrivals of colder weather and flurries  the recipes featuring bright  sunny citrus are a welcome respite. Dishes like Winter Caprese with Blood Orange  Beet and Mozzarella di Bufala  Spaghetti with Ricotta  Orange and Crispy Sage Chocolate and Orange Pannetone  and Sicilian Orange Salad with Olive Oil  Marjoram  and Flaky Sea Salt are sure to stave off winter colds and chase the winter blahs away with the generous amount of vitamin C.  Others like Potato and apple-stuffed cabbage rolls with Walnut Butter and Gruyere  German beef  beet and potato stew  and Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Shallots and Apple  provide stick-to-your-ribs comfort.  The salads are a particular delight  including the rainbow potato salad with radishes  shallot vinaigrette and poached eggs  beet and apple carpaccio with pomegranate  raw asparagus and peach salad with orange blossom water and pecorino  and rainbow potato and cucumber salad with dill-pistachio pesto that will bring a splash of color (and flavor!) to overcast days.  Seasonal ingredients are given light-handed treatments that allow their individual textures and delicate flavors to shine  like fresh strawberries with saffron-vanilla sugar  watermelon caprese with mozzarella di bufala  basil and mint  and squash pasta with orange  maple and sage.  If you are someone who  like me  can never seem to come up with a complete menu  that’s one of the beauties of 365: You can also use the weekly menu planner to come up with a seasonal balanced meal by combining the various options for a given week.  I was absolutely intrigued by the idea of candied cherry tomatoes slow roasted and tossed with olive oil  confectioner’s sugar  and herbs  they dissolve into a silky confit that is the perfect complement for fresh pasta and tiny basil. Plus the leftover oil and tomatoes make a fantastic dipping oil!  Measurements and temperatures are provided in both US / Imperial and metric.  This has become one of my favorite cookbooks of the last several years highly recommended.,1
Carl Hiaasen,CARL HIAASEN DOES IT AGAIN!. I've read other books by Carl Hiaasen and have enjoyed every one of them.  He's an excellent story teller and keeps your attention until the very end.,1

slightly sheer for larger cup sizes,"Comfy Dress. This dress is so comfortable that it feels like wearing your favorite t-shirt. It's soft and has a hint of stretch. There are flattering pleats at the waist and it even has pockets. If you're a larger cup size  the top may be slightly sheer. I found the fit to be true to size. I sized down for a more fitted look. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the small.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",0
Eight O'Clock coffee,Love this coffee. Love this coffee  heard about it on a morning tv program that they conducted a blind taste test. Eight O'Clock coffee was number one  beating out big names that have a coffee shop on nearly every street corner around the USA. Marketing!! Ha LOL,1
add to it monthly,Nice way to plan and save. I like this feature because I can add to it monthly  or whenever. The value is there for me to build towards a purchase or a surprise expense that pops up.,1
leaves skin feeling moisturized,Nice Exfoliation. My daughter is a huge fan of I Dew Care products. I ordered this for her  but I gave it a try first as I am a huge fan of body scrubs! This scrub has a waxy-like consistency. I found it best to rub it between my hands for a moment before applying it to my body. In doing so  it lathers a little bit and changes the consistency to something that won't glob onto your body. There is a good amount of grit to it  but it's not rough or scratchy. It actually does a nice job of exfoliating. I was hoping for a delicious coconut smell  but it's not. I can't pinpoint the actual scent  but it's very nice and pleasant. The scrub rinses well. Because of the waxy base of the scrub  it doesn't leave your skin feeling dry or stripped. There's no waxy build up either. I think my daughter will enjoy it. I was especially pleased with how it worked on my hands and elbows.,1
narrow,Good but.... I know it is a pipette but it is just too narrow for what I needed.  Do be careful as they are glass and can break.,0
manual is very helpful,I love this ocarina! So pretty and easy to use. The manual is very helpful!. Love this will practice til I can get Saria's song and Song of Storms at the very least! (Was a little dissapointed that last one wasn't on the music sheet). I am so glad with the sounds I could get from this on my first try though! I had another ocarina but it wasn't a 12 hole it was a 6 hole I believe and I had trouble getting nice sounds from it it felt a lot different from this one! I am truly in love the design is so good and pretty I did find a few spots that weren't very well painted though but overall I am totally in love with my new Ocarina &#603,1
cute necklace,Runner necklace. Very cute necklace. Bought for a gift to a Runner. She loves it,1
The full image is on the bottom of the box,Animal Crossing Vibe. This cat island puzzle has an Animal Crossing vibe to it. The image is fun and colorful  plus it has lots of cats! The pieces are a good size and cut well. I didn't notice any puzzle dust. I did not care for the company logo being on the back of every piece. That actually made it a little more difficult to sort because you had to look at both sides to make sure you were putting the right side up. It doesn't come with a poster of the image either. I really appreciate that addition to puzzles. It's a pain to have to hold the box in your hand just so you can see where things go. The full image is on the bottom of the box. The lid has a blown up picture that doesn't show everything. Plus  the brand logo is on both of the images. They really are pushing their logo on us!! They do include a business card size picture of the puzzle but that's really impossible to use because it's so small.,0
paratransit,Delicious!. I love these Clif bars. All that yummy goodness with the chocolate in every bite is just my favorite snack morning  noon  and night. I keep them in my purse at all times. Yes I said them as in 2-3. I’m disabled so I ride the bus or parstransit and it never fails that someone else wants to try it and half a bar leaves me hungry so I always carry spares now. You should too!,0
not as good as I was hoping,Good to help read fine print. Not as good as I was hoping  but not bad,0
a little weird,Not bad. I think the masks work for kids. Covers their mouth and nose. It fit my six year old and two year old. As another reviewer mentioned  the words are mirrored so that is a little weird.,0
high-quality overall,Amazing customer service and cats are obsessed.. I recommend the “without treats” subscription as you get an extra toy. So far my cats are obsessed with at least one toy from each box we’ve received. The others are still appreciated. They're always based around a cool theme and there is one wand toy included each month. At least a couple are manufactured in the US (maybe handmade?). They seem pretty high-quality overall. I’ve gotten two boxes so far and love that meowbox offers a bimonthly subscription through the website. Meowbox also has amazing customer service.,1
colors are very very bright,Nice. Feels great on  but the colors are very very bright.  In the end  these are too intense of a color for me  so I ordered the clear version  which I LOVE  and use every day.,0

playing this game,A lovely little piece of nostalgia!. As a kid I remember playing Pokémon Red on my Game Boy and Pokemon Yellow on my Game Boy Color and have so many fond memories of it.  Now  as a 31 year old man  I bought this game with my Switch to try to relive some of those moments and enjoy the nostalgia.  I haven’t played any Pokémon games since Pokemon Yellow so playing this game was a real treat!  This game was really fun! I don’t regret buying it. But having said that it does have some flaws. Firstly: This Pokémon game was ALOT easier than the older Red  Blue and Yellow ones. I was able to collect all 8 badges in 10 hours of playtime  a lot of that time I wasn’t even playing and just left the game on and a lot more of it was spent in the constant cut scenes. It seems like just when I feel like I’m really getting going Sonia  or especially  Hop interfere and want to have long conversations or  for Hop  to duel me. It’s pretty annoying. Not only that but the fights are much easier. I got through every gym and got all 8 badges without losing a single battle. I didn’t even bother looking for more powerful Pokémon because the first 6 I got were fine and able to beat anyone I came across.  Having said that  this game is great for children! It’s not too hard where they’ll get frustrated  but it’s not too easy for children either. Each gym battle (except one) is fought in a huge arena and it feels great to hear the crowd cheering you on. The music is upbeat and really got me in the mood to kick butt. Each badge earned comes with a sense of accomplishment which is great.  All in all I do recommend this game for children or for adults who played the older games and just want some nostalgia.,0
not good advertising,DOES NOT WORK AT ALL!. I PURCHASED TWO BAGS FOR TWO SMALL POTS FOR MY PLANTS.  REGARDLESS OF WATER OR TOSSING - IT DOES NOT EXPAND AT ALL.  THIS IS NOT GOOD ADVERTISING.  IT IS AN INJUSTICE TO A TRUSTING CONSUMER.,0
hymns (O Holy Night and Silent Night),"Disappointing Debut Album. What were they thinking to put out an album like this from the man who wants to sing opera?  This is an odd assortment of songs with only Nessun Dorma from opera.  And what's with singing pop songs in Italian?  Did they not have enough opera songs that Paul was good at so that they had to take other songs that he knew and make them sound like opera?  Then to include the hymns (O Holy Night and Silent Night)  which Paul does okay with  but have been done far better by many singers.  The worst stinker on the album is the Spanish version of My Way.  Also Paul has an interesting way of pronouncing MUSIC.  He sings ""Moo-Sick""  rather that ""Mew-Sick"" as most of us say it in the song Music of the Night.  Paul has a way of going deep into the soul (or something like that) and bringing people to tears with his songs. (Yes  me too.)  He is not the best singer  but with that way of getting to people in a very deep way  he will succeed.  Give the man 10 stars  but this recording doesn't rate much more than 3 or 4.  It's a shame and I truly hope this is not the ""one chance"" for Paul Potts to shine.  I honestly believe he will shine if they do a good job on future albums.",0
length,Beautiful & Good Quality. I just received this nose ring.  It is very pretty and of good quality.  The heart is a nice size and has a little sparkle to it.  I gave only four stars because of the fit.  It'd be nice if it was a tad bit longer.  I wish nose stud makers would offer a variety of lengths for those of us with slightly larger noses who do not wish to bother with altering fishtails.,0
shea butter,Softest skin I have had in years!. I have been using Pre de Provence soaps for years now. When I saw this one which includes shea butter  I couldn't wait to try it. After using this exclusively for almost a month  my skin feels  and looks  incredibly soft and smooth. I have terribly dry skin and always use a moisturizer after my shower  but now I have an additional aid to my dry skin in the shower. I love the fragrance  it is light and not overly strong. Pre de Provence makes quality products and I highly recommend them to everyone.,1
straighten the pen in order to thread the beads on,Navitity pins. You have to straighten the pen in order to thread the beads on... and then bend back into shape... and then they don't pin onto your clothes very easily.  Just a disappointed.  Also  about half the of savior pieces were broken in two.  Eh.,0
love the bagless super large cup,The best out there in the $100 to $300 price range. It was time to upgrade from my old hoover and spend a little more to get all the features I wanted  LIKES * Using it weekly used on 4 bedrooms  office & library  porch and even the garage * Great suction * Great tool to get corners  window sills  and behind furniture * Great tool for furniture * LOVE the bagless super large cup * Simple to empty * Not cumbersome - it's not light weight but I am 50 years old and not in the best shape and I have no issues * Easy turn on off * Hepa filter - easy to install - save yourself the hassle and replace instead of cleaning * goes under most furniture,1
light,Not bad!. So I got this with the intent to play Super Mario Odyssey. I received this and the official Pro Controller around the same time and  while I much prefer playing with the Pro Controller because of many reasons  I still use this one for other games besides Odyssey.  The feel of this one is a bit on the light side. It's hollow  though I suspect that's for any lack of vibration. The buttons are nice and clicky  more so than the ones on the Pro Controller  and I actually prefer the buttons on this one. However  because of the slightly wider (larger?) size  the shoulder buttons may be slightly more difficult to reach than the Pro Controller. The thumbsticks are longer  which I do not like for platformers and racing games. They may be good for FPS games  but I find there are far more genres of games on the Switch than FPS.  The back buttons are a nice addition  though I hardly ever use them. I've programmed them to duplicate L and R and thought I'd use them more often  but I don't. They work well enough and are positioned so as not to be in the way of accidental presses  but are within reach if necessary.  The texture is a nice matte feel  so no sweaty palms.  Overall  a great controller if you're looking for one on the budget.,0
band gives me headaches,Really like these. So why 4 stars?  I read the review  measured it out and decided for the large instead of the next larger choice  because I really have some thick hair.  They are so pretty  and they even gave me an extra stick. I love using them however I can't use them as I did when I was younger (yes in the 70's).  I can't get the barrette around my hair - I have to use a band first - which defeats both it being pretty and it's use to begin with.  I can attach it  but not around 'all' of my hair.  So I should have ordered the larger ones  because I was trying to omit the band altogether as they give my headaches which is why I used them back in the day.  So I eventually cut my hair length and now use these just to tack the front hair back.  If you have really thick hair  buy the larger size!,0
offers like five or six products,Full & trial sizes premium beauty products. I like this subscription box because it offers full sized skin care and make up products and they are premium beauty products. However  I do not like the fact that the box does not offer very many products it only offers like five or six and I feel like it’s over priced. I suggest the ipsy subscription that offers make up skin care and products for your body and they come in full and trial sizes and that has been a great subscription box for me.,0
feel a difference,This really works!. I have suffered from neck  shoulder and upper back pain for years now. I get massages and use massage guns to get relief  but it still exists. When I saw this device I was a little skeptical  but I started using it nightly while watching television. I set it up behind me and let the infrared lights do their work. After using this for about a month now  I can say I feel a difference. The warmth  heat has made the pain minimize and I feel great after using it for about 15-20 minutes. Afterwards  I use it on my face to help activate collagen (my spa uses a similar light on my face as well and my skin looks great). I highly recommend this device for anyone with pain (especially).,1

elegant gloves,Beautiful well made elegant gloves. These soft dress leather (not suede) gloves are true to size  have a warm wool lining  length is slightly longer than wrist length (as pictured)  and the leather bow trim is very nicely done.

so pretty,Beautiful. I ended up gorilla gluing this to a .... Beautiful.  I ended up gorilla gluing this to a table because birds and squirrels would knock her over.  It only has room for a small amount of seed to it is not my primary bird feeder but it is so pretty.,1
love it,Totally worth the money and cute AF. Totally adorable and will be a gift for my 11yr old  she will love it!,1
unfold legs is easy,Hard to blow up! Very light weight.. This baby tub folds in half  which it then does not take up much space. it has to snap open  easy to do. Then unfold the legs down..Easy..  Then you have to blow up the plastic liner underneath. There are two plastic holes to blow up on each side. It was like blowing up a beach ball which is easy   but this is much harder.. Not only harder to blow  which I could not do  but if you can blow this up  you then have to put the rubber stoppers to close it FAST or any air that you could blow in it  will leak out fast. This also has a plastic smell to it  which I think after awhile will dissipate  I hope!  I could not for the life of me get any air into this thing. Maybe I did something wrong!  The plastic liner is thin  and I think it could leak after a while.  Before putting a baby On the plastic liner  you have to put down a baby towel so it is soft for the baby to lay on to.  So far I should have given this a 1 star. But it looks cute  and the colors are nice! I have not given my Hubby a chance to blow this up yet. If he can figure this out with success  I'll be back with a new review.,0
throw them outside,turned out AOK after all. my cats sniffed them but didnt chew them ....  i unfortunately cant eat them to give a good review  LOL  I guess they will play with them  or ill throw them outside maybe the possums will eat them  UPDATE one of my cats chews them but she's young the older cat  chewed on one and a tooth fell out  LOL i sent a pack to my friend who has a LOT of cats and they are happy,0
poorly finished lid that was rough and burred causing the seal to fail,Poor quality. Arrived timely packaged minimally and professionally. After install product leaked considerably. Further eval revealed a poorly finished lid that was rough and burred  this caused the seal around the O-ring to fail.  I discarded the entire thing and bought a replacement from Lowe’s.,0
exhaust on the side,"Mixed blessing  but so far  so good. I looked at probably 20 portable ice makers before choosing this one. Price was a factor  but so was customer input from reviews. It seemed like many of the other models were the exact same machine with a different company label stuck on them  and their reviews were so varied  it seemed like you either got a lemon or a good one.  Also  all the others opened at the top and vented on the side. For some reason  I thought this one would work better in our area  with the drawer pulling out at the front  and I THOUGHT the vent would be at the side like all the other machines.  My purpose in buying this is not for a bar or camper  like many people. I am partially disabled  and can't get downstairs to the kitchen on any sort of regular basis. I really wanted to be able to have ice when I wanted some  especially with the heat of summer rolling in very  very soon. I don't like room temperature drinks  esp water or tea  so I'd found myself drinking Pepsi almost exclusively  the only thing I could stand at room temp. That needed to stop!  So  I ended up buying this one  but the experience was not a pleasant one. I love my Amazon prime dearly  but they really botched this one. The shipping dates got moved around even after I paid extra for one-day shipping  and ended up with this being delivered on a totally different day  when I was the only one home and could not come to the door. (Note that Amazon did end up giving me a small credit on my acct to try to make up for the shipping problem  even though it did not solve my problem.) I always chat with the UPS guys through the upstairs window  so they left it for me anyway. I knew my son would be home very shortly after  and he was. He brought the box up  and I have to say that I am almost positive I got a customer return. The box looked like it had previous shipping labels peeled off of it. The box was beat up  torn  and had a crushed in spot on the side. Our UPS guys are really great  so I think it was shipped out from Day One looking like that - who in the warehouses think customers really want something that looks that bad?! (And yes  I know this is a product review section  and I can file shipping problems elsewhere  and I will. Just giving folks a heads-up of how it is shipped and what I received.) This is shipped in its original mfg box with tie cords on it  there is no other packaging other than what the mfg sends it out with - no Amazon packaging whatsoever. Strike One.  I opened the box  not sure of what I would find. It only has two big strips of styrofoam on the sides to hold it. Ours indeed had a dent in the side  and one of the back exhaust fans had cracked plastic. Not a crisis  but at this price  I really do expect a brand new item in great condition! Strike Two.  SMELLS/TASTE: I read a lot of reviews that talk about the plastic smell and/or taste in the cubes  and how it didn't seem to want to fire up well. IF someone reads the directions (not everyone likes to do that!)  you'd see it says to make sure the machine sits for at least an hour to allow the coolant to properly settle back into place after you unpack it. This particular model also says to run a bleach solution through it to help clean it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT!! The machine indeed smells heavily of plastic. Anyone who has had a relay switch burn out on an item knows what smell I am talking about - sort of like melting plastic. Ugh. However  having read plenty about portable ice makers before buying one  I knew that either vinegar or lemon juice would also work just fine. I chose to go with one that was ingestible  rather than bleach!! We did the lemon juice  and ran an entire cycle of cubes through it with the lemon/water. (Toss the ice please!) I then ran two loads (all the cubes a full water tank would make) through it of plain water. AFTER those cycles  I wiped it out again and ran regular water through it to try making cubes we'd use. We had no problems at all with any funny tastes in our ice this way. If you have a bad quality of tap water though  I'd suggest using either bottled  filtered or distilled water. It is only natural that your cubes will not taste better than your tap water. Ours is okay  so we're good that way. I would have bought a water filter (like a Brita) if that had not been the case. No lemony taste  no plastic taste  no gross tastes or odors at all. (Remember  I really do NOT recommend using bleach like the mfg suggests. While I understand the germ-killing properties of the bleach  I really don't want to ingest any of it. I would also think it would be much more caustic to the plastic parts and hoses of the machine  wearing them out sooner. Stick with lemon juice.) It did smell like plastic out the exhaust fan for quite a while  but it is fading away.  NOISE: Of course it is going to make noise. This has a compressor  and it will be making some noise. However  I've found that at its noisiest part of the cycle  it is no different than a microwave oven running  sometimes a little quieter.The ice cubes dumping make me jump a little bit  at least at first  but then again I am easily startled. Made the cats jump too! LOL! However  they are pretty much used to it now  even if they eyeball it suspiciously while it is running.  I have to say that I haven't stopped to time an actual cycle to make the ice. I've tried the small  medium and large cubes though. They are all gumdrop-shaped (or like the Dots candy at the movies)  with a hole in the middle of the bottom. It didn't seem to take very long though. The small ones were a little too small for my uses  but would be good for smaller drink glasses. I use a [[ASIN:B003X46LHG Bubba Brands Keg 52 Oz Mug Slate Gray]] to hold the ice at the moment  and love it. If you use the medium size  you can get the first batch in around 10 minutes  but the other batches do seem to take longer for some reason. It has also seemed to get ""stuck"" where it runs and runs  with nothing going on. I turn it off  let it sit a minute and push start again  and off it goes. I am not sure if it is just my machine with the dents from rough handling  or if all of this model is like that.  I was disappointed that this unit does not exhaust on the side  reason being where I planned to locate it  on a table behind my bed! It would vent towards my pillow  which is just not gonna happen. So  I have it turned sideways so it will vent towards the doorway. It makes opening the ice drawer more awkward  and makes me wish I'd tried one of the top-opening models now. There wasn't anything in the photos and such to suggest that this unit would be different than most of the other portable ice makers. It is. I'll post photos at a later date.  This model's book also suggests plugging the machine in to a GFI outlet  or grounded plug that will shut off if it senses dampness. I don't have one in the bedroom  and currently am using a heavy-duty  three-prong extension cord and plugging it in in the bathroom  where we do have a GFI plug. Not ideal  but better than trying to get a special outlet installed in a rented bedroom.  The scoop is VERY tiny. It works best to scoop towards you  so you don't send ice cubes back into the machine. The measuring cup works well for pouring  because you have a small reservoir to fill  and you have to go over a small clear rubber ""wall"" that helps to hold the drawer in place and hold temperatures.  Any unused ice does indeed melt back into the reservoir and is recycled back into cubes. Once I have enough ice for anyone who wants it  I turn it off rather than let it continually cycle. I also unplug it in the evenings when I go to bed for the night  since I'm the only one who can't go downstairs for ice if they want it. I hope that saves on the ""vampire electricity"" of the unit. Note that this is not a refrigerated ice maker  and the unused ice WILL melt. Many people complained about ice cubes stuck together - I've only experienced that when getting ice that has been done for an hour or so (it keeps the ice for at least an hour after the last cycle at this point) - otherwise  the cubes are all loose and easy to use. If you try to take the ice drawer all the way out after leaving the ice sit for a while  it WILL leak water on you - the water is simply the ice melting back and going through the drain holes that let it run back into the reservoir. (Nope - I didn't even think about the drainage holes when I pulled the drawer out the first time  and had water on the table and the floor. That was my fault though.)  For now  I am mostly happy with it. I cannot tell you how nice it is to have ice when I want it  instead of waiting for someone to get home in the evening and get me some! It was an expensive luxury though  and one I really thought long and hard about getting since I can no longer work. I'm thinking I really want to keep it. The cosmetic issues were VERY annoying  since I paid for a new machine  not a used one  but in this case  I blame Amazon for sending this out with a crushed box from the get-go. I would not have accepted it  had I been able to get to the door and saw it. Again - for some reason  this was the most problematic purchase I've ever had in all my time on Amazon.  This machine has not reached Strike Three yet  but you can be sure I'll come back and update my review should that happen. For now  I'll keep running it  and see how it seems to work  dents  cracked exhaust grid and all. (The dents are even more annoying  because it has a stainless steel appearance. It shows readily. It was more of a hassle to return it than to just keep it  as long as it continues to work.)  UPDATE June 29  2012: Well  I've had this machine for a little over a month now. Is it perfect? Nope. Does it make ice? Yep. Does it make a little noise?  Yep  but not unbearable. So far  the broken parts do not seem to be affecting the basic function of the machine. While I still have not literally timed the cube cycle (I have good intentions  but seems like there's always something better to do than watch the clock for ice cubes to drop! Ha!)  I have found the medium cubes to be the most useful. In fact  I often use an empty Sobe Lifewater bottle to make quick tea (loving the new tea from Lipton with the honey in it)  and the medium cubes fit in this bottle perfectly. So  that might give folks a better idea about the size of the medium cube. The difference in the sizes are basically more (or less) layers of ice on the cubes. The small ones are still too big for a basic 16.9 oz water bottle  and melt too fast when I shake up my tea. The first batch of the day takes around 10 minutes  but for some reason  they are skinnier than the normal mediums. The machine makes additional batches inbetween 10-15 minutes. Around 2 or 2-1/2 of the water cup it comes with to fill the reservoir to maximum. That will fill the ice bin to the top with medium cubes.  At this point  I increased my stars by one  because of the function of the machine  and it being willing to do what I ""hired"" it to do - keep me in cold drinks. Strike three has not yet happened  and I hope it doesn't! Enjoy!",0
good quality,These bags are a decent thickness.  They add both sides together to get the 9.5 mil. Don't think the bag side is 9.5 mil thick.  It's a total of both sides when laying flat.  The bags are still of good quality.  They are a decent value at approximately 33 cents each.  I would buy these again.  Be careful with hard pointy items such as dehydrated carrots  they can poke through.,1

pandan custard and sticky rice,A gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!. When I think of Malaysian dishes  it’s the spicy  layered flavors of Norman Musa’s “Amazing Malaysian” that I think of. It opens with street food and snacks  and moves on to seafood  meat  vegetables  rice and noodles  pudding and drinks  and the Malaysian pantry. Gorgeous photos of street scenes in Malaysia pepper the pages  while the gold-embossed cover looks great sitting out on a table or countertop.  You'll find street snack favorites like chicken satay  net pancakes  roti canai  and fried spring rolls  along with Indian lentil patties  grilled fish paste in banana leaf  tofu stuffed with crunchy vegetables  and the gorgeous Kak Besah’s curry puffs. The seafood dishes reminded me of many preparations I had last year while working in Taiwan whole fish steamed with lemongrass  ginger and chilies  squid stir fry  and scrambled eggs with oysters. The meat dishes featured are mostly chicken and beef (no pork unlike Ping’s book)  with lamb curry  beef rendang  and numerous chicken dishes.  One of my new favorite recipes is the Nyonya Vermicelli Noodle Salad  which features rice noodles  tofu beansprouts  and ginger with plenty of lime juice and fresh herbs (if you are vegetarian  leave out the shrimp paste and prawns). I also loved the Malay Vegetable Dhal Curry  pumpkin in turmeric and coconut milk  and eggs in chili sambal (think shakshuka).  Rice and noodle dishes include tomato rice (nasi tomato)  wok-fried flat noodles  curry laksa  chicken rice  herbal rice  and several egg-fried rices in addition to fried noodles. Desserts range from the effortless (fresh mango  honey and coconut  tropical fruit salad) to the more elaborate (pandan custard and sticky rice layered sweet  sticky rice balls  soy panna cotta with passion fruit and crushed chocolate cookies. And you’ll find any number of refreshing drinks  from lemongrass and honey tea and rose syrup drink to pulled sweet tea and iced fresh lime juice.  At the end are several staple condiments  from the ubiquitous chili paste and ginger soy sauce  to sambals (chili  coconut)  sauces  and vegetable pickles.  Norman Musa’s recipes tend to be a bit more advanced but also result in more complex  nuanced flavors. This is a gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!,1

Great little helmet,I like it. Great little helmet. It fit my three year old perfectly.,1
wrapped the back with adhesive vinyl,Excellent optics  great for spinning tops. While this product is probably intended for optical use  the 250mm focal length from my trials is the best curvature for spinning tops to quickly and consistently achieve a stable centered vertical state.  It is lightweight at 50 grams and thin 2.5mm thickness at the edge.  The top edge is a bit sharp  and to reduce the chances of it breaking under the stress of a top hitting against the surface  I wrapped the entire back of mine up to that top edge with adhesive vinyl (black electrical tape would work fine too).  A fee fine scratches have appeared on the mirror from lots of use with some heavier tops  but none that impair the spin to any significant degree.  I usually set this on top of my foreverspin base which matches the curvature  and if the tabletop isn't exactly level  I can adjust the mirror position to achieve a centered spin.  Optically very little distortion and bright.  Great product  well made.,0
had trouble getting nice sounds from it,I love this ocarina! So pretty and easy to use. The manual is very helpful!. Love this will practice til I can get Saria's song and Song of Storms at the very least! (Was a little dissapointed that last one wasn't on the music sheet). I am so glad with the sounds I could get from this on my first try though! I had another ocarina but it wasn't a 12 hole it was a 6 hole I believe and I had trouble getting nice sounds from it it felt a lot different from this one! I am truly in love the design is so good and pretty I did find a few spots that weren't very well painted though but overall I am totally in love with my new Ocarina &#603,0

would have made a lot more sense to program the sets in chronological order,Beach Boys' Sounds of Summer Redux. The sound is uniformly fabulous.  The hits (99% of them  anyway) are all here.  The 80 (!) tracks spread over three discs have never sounded better  truly.  Following on the heels of the fantastic Feel Flows box set though  there's a certain bump in the road here.  The trouble is the programming it's just so random.  Spanning the Boys' 60-year-career  it would have made a lot more sense (to me  anyway) to program the sets in chronological order according to release  whether by each individual disc or start-to-finish across all three discs.  A minor complaint  I admit  but annoying enough to me that I can't give it the full tilt boogie I'd like to.  Four classic Hobie surfboards and definitely recommended to fans of the band.,0
Prime shipping,Wonderful  amazing piano  and what a sound!. This piano is the most exciting one I've ever owned. I'm 85 years old and have had 4 pianos in my lifetime an upright when I was ten years old  a baby grand when I was in my thirties  a Baldwin spinet when I was older and downsizing. BUT ... this Donner electric is beyond wonderful. My daughter and I put it together in about 1 hour and I sat down to it and cut loose. Wow. What a tone  especially in the bass range. I was so thrilled I just started to weep. I can't believe this piano plays and sounds so wonderful! I was pianist for my church over 25 years and played the finest instruments  but this Donner just thrills me. I can't believe this company can offer this piano for such a reasonable price and at Prime shipping. It came right to my door less than a week after I bought it. Thank you  thank you  thank you.,1

intended to stick on the wall,Easy to Assemble. I was a little alarmed when I first opened this and saw that they were not assembled. However  assembly was easy and I didn't even have to read the instruction booklet to do so. I am using this toothbrush holder directly on the counter without the adhesive. When I ordered it  I didn't even notice that it was intended to stick on the wall. It's doing fine on the counter. It keeps my sonic toothbrush upright better than it was doing on its own. There are 2 toothbrush holders in this set.,0
fit is comfortable,Great gaming headset. Great value gaming headset. Comes with all the standard adapters. Fit is comfortable and connects easily to Xbox and iPad. Mic works will with online game play. These aren’t an all around headset. The audio isn’t going to blow you away if you’re an  audiofile. This is a value headset for gaming.,1
keep the clean ones separate from the used,Great wet dry bag. I use these for transporting disposable pads. This bag has 2 compartments  so i can keep the clean ones seperate from the used. I can store about 10 pads in this bag. No smell emanates from the bag after many hours  which is great. Bag also washes well in the washing machine.,1
grounds clogging the filter,French Press works better. I was so excited to use this for cold brew since I love so many OXO products  but this was a disappointment. I’ve been making cold brew in a French press until now  and I have been pleased with the results  but since it requires hands on filtering  I thought this OXO system would simplify the filtering and allow the machine to do most of the work. Wrong. With a French Press  once the coffee has brewed  I can press the coffee and separate most of the grounds from the cold brew. Then I slowly pour it out into a mesh filter lined with a paper filter and wait for it to slowly seep through. I have to change the paper filter half way through before pouring the second half. With this OXO system  you are supposed to be able to flip the switch and the cold brew will drip down in to the glass carafe below. But the grounds kept clogging the filter and then absolutely no liquid could get through. (I will also note that I have a quality conical burr grinder  so the grind should not be an issue.) I had to stand over it for about 15 min scraping the grounds to the side or scooping spoonfuls of grounds out of the brewing container. After 15 minutes of this  we were left with roughly 2/3 of the volume of cold brew we would have gotten from the same recipe in a French press. The reduced volume was partially due to me scooping grounds out of the way and throwing them in the sink  and partially because there was no way to effectively press the liquid out of the grounds. Also the taste was inferior. Again probably because the most concentrated cold brew couldn’t be pressed out of the grounds. Overall the taste was nowhere as good and the process was more cumbersome than a French press. I wish I loved this machine  but on the plus side  it’s one less thing to sit on my counter and take up more space in the fridge.,0
lower-functioning end of the Aspergers scale,"""You have Asperger's. Asperger's doesn't have you."" Can I get an amen?. Rudy Simone's ""Aspergirls: Empowering Females With Asperger Syndrome"" is a wonderful starting point for all Aspergirls  whether you're an Aspergirl yourself or you have an Apergirl in your life. This thoughtfully-written guide examines the oft-overlooked Aspergirl  who's been clinically ignored in favor of male Aspies (traditional figures put the boy-girl ratio at 4:1  but that is rapidly changing as 1 in 100 children are believed to be on the autism spectrum). Because Aspergirls may be better at socializing in small doses and tend to be a little more expressive than their male counterparts  they may be able to ""pass"" as neurotypical (NT) and not receive a proper AS diagnosis other than being ""shy"" or ""difficult.""  Simone has interviewed numerous Aspergirls regarding their experiences in all walks of life  from surviving schoolyard bullies  PTSD  and selective mutism to college  dating  motherhood and employment. She also discusses the Asperger's ""is it a gift or a disability?"" debate. Each chapter ends with ""Advice to Aspergirls"" and ""Advice to Parents "" a thoughtful touch that includes the whole family in the discussion. The book wraps up with advice from Aspergirls to Aspergirls (inspirational bullet points such as the title of this review) and the cleverly-titled ""Give Your Aspergirl some B.A.L.L.S.: Belief  Acceptance  Love  Like  and Support."" Appendix A also features a handy chart of female Asperger traits and main female / male differences in Asperger's. There is a small list of references and resources  and I was surprised not to see any of Tony Attwood's books listed (although he's mentioned by name several times). Simone frequently promotes her own books [[ASIN:1849058032 22 Things a Woman Must Know: If She Loves a Man With Asperger's Syndrome]] and [[ASIN:1935274090 Asperger's on the Job: Must-have Advice for People with Asperger's or High Functioning Autism  and their Employers  Educators  and Advocates]] in nearly every chapter.  Simone and the various interviewees put Aspie sensations into words that NTs can understand this is in itself a feat  since our first language isn't words  but images and sensations (see [[ASIN:0307739589 Thinking in Pictures (Expanded  Tie-in Edition): My Life with Autism (Vintage)]]). Simone discusses triggers (fluorescent lights  loud noises  scratchy fabrics) and meltdowns in detail  both internally and externally. In the chapter on stimming  she introduces the term ""soothing "" which has fewer negative connotations.  There are several chapters devoted to depression  medication  abuse and PTSD. I was particularly interested in Chapter 19  Stomach Issues and Autism. I've had digestive issues my whole life  and never previously connected AS with digestive disorders. At times  the book went into New Age-y territory  with suggestions on herbal supplements and discussions on psychic sensitivity  reiki  and chi  along with several popular AS diets  including gluten-free and casein-free (see: [[ASIN:184310055X A User Guide to the GF/CF Diet for Autism  Asperger Syndrome and AD/HD]] for more information).  When I was younger  Aspergers wasn't ever mentioned and hadn't gained the widespread recognition that it currently has. I sincerely wish that this book had been available throughout my rocky adolescence hopefully  ""Aspergirls"" will smooth the path for today's young Aspergirls. If you're the parent of an Aspergirl  some of the stories in this book are on the lower-functioning end of the Aspergers scale don't automatically assume that your daughter will exhibit *all* of these symptoms. Every Aspergirl is different. Just be proud of your smart  funny  and talented daughter. Or if you're an Aspergirl yourself...Aspergrrrrrl power!",0
pants are unlined,"Ring the Alarm!!!. Someone should call the cops because looking this good should be a crime. This jumpsuit is oh-so-glam! I honestly can't believe how great it looks for the price. The fabric is a lightweight chiffon-like fabric with a hint of stretch. As a woman with rippled thighs  I was concerned about the combination of a light color and a thin fabric. No worries!! There's no show-through even though the pants are unlined. If you're a larger cup size  you'll probably need to wear a tube top or bandeau under this for more coverage. I'm not judging if you want to show off your goodies. The belt is long enough to wrap around twice. I did this for extra cinching. The color I chose is more of a sage green than a true mint. Pay close attention to the size chart. I found it to be very accurate. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the X-Large.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",0
VOLATILE,LOTS OF ALLERGIES AND BEST Essential Oils I Ever Bought.. I bought this set last June and just opened it now. The fact that the oils are SO fresh upon opening nine months later says a lot.  A few things you have to understand:  The negative review about allergy upon skin contact is only ONE case. As someone with a ton of skin sensitivities and contact dermatitis  I also got a tiny bit itchy with mixing the orange  lemongrass and rosemary onto my skin but THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. These are 100% essential oil  NOT mixed with any kind of carrier. If you go to Whole Foods and buy one of the AuraCacia oils  many are mixed with jojoba oil so that they are easier on skin. Yes  they also have a line of 100% essential oils but these are a much better value. These are FULL POTENCY and VOLATILE which means yes  they *can* burn skin and SHOULD NOT be used on or around pets (do research as I know some oils are poisonous to cats). Any full potency oil can be extremely toxic to children if ingested. If you are making a batch of homemade lotion  DIY sanitizers or whatever else  you add like 4-5 drops for every CUP of product. More than that is going to be way too much. That said  this is actually a REALLY great value for this entire set. And non-GMO  Organic?!!! AMAZING.,0
dries the feet out,Less sweat  dried feet. I am on the fence about this product.  It states to apply 3 times a day at first.  Who has time for that?  I did apply at least twice a day.  For the first few days  it did nothing.  After repeated use  it started to help decrease the sweating of my feed.  It does state this in the directions.  It dries the feet out  which I guess is the point  but aesthetically speaking  it doesn’t look great.  I want nice looking feet   not over dried looking.  The bottle is pretty small .  It lasted about a month.  I did buy another bottle  so I could really decide whether I liked it or not.  I am still deciding whether to buy another or not.  Don’t like how my feet look when using it  but I like having less sweaty feet.  I am wondering how it would work if just used during exercise  when the sweating is worse.,0
Jane Fonda is under rated,Cat Ballou. This is such a great comedy classic.  One of Lee Marvin's best.  And Jane Fonda is under rated.  The music and story are worth the price of admission.  It's a family friendly comedy - worth owning in my personal opinion.,1
requires the use of a cell phone,Fun. My family has enjoyed Just Dance games over the years. This one is a little different because it requires the use of a cell phone. While I'm not crazy about that  it does seem to work well. The song list is pretty good  though as with most of the Just Dance games  I only knew about half of the songs. To access all of the songs  you do have to subscribe to something. Long gone are the days when the purchase of the game included access to all of the songs.,0

laughing at most of the comedians,Really much funnier and entertaining than I expected. I was a little leery about chosing this DVD thinking it would be a little too mild to be funny. But I actually found myself laughing at most of the comedians (most of whom I had never seen before). I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of dirty talking  nasty comedians and is looking for an alternative entertainment format. I loved this  will definitely be looking into prior releases to purchase for my collection.,1
addicted to the game,Fun Fun Fun. I like the different type of tower's. The hidden keys. I have this on 2 devices. Both on desperate levels 😂😂😂❤️ yes I'm addicted!!,1
buttons,Not bad!. So I got this with the intent to play Super Mario Odyssey. I received this and the official Pro Controller around the same time and  while I much prefer playing with the Pro Controller because of many reasons  I still use this one for other games besides Odyssey.  The feel of this one is a bit on the light side. It's hollow  though I suspect that's for any lack of vibration. The buttons are nice and clicky  more so than the ones on the Pro Controller  and I actually prefer the buttons on this one. However  because of the slightly wider (larger?) size  the shoulder buttons may be slightly more difficult to reach than the Pro Controller. The thumbsticks are longer  which I do not like for platformers and racing games. They may be good for FPS games  but I find there are far more genres of games on the Switch than FPS.  The back buttons are a nice addition  though I hardly ever use them. I've programmed them to duplicate L and R and thought I'd use them more often  but I don't. They work well enough and are positioned so as not to be in the way of accidental presses  but are within reach if necessary.  The texture is a nice matte feel  so no sweaty palms.  Overall  a great controller if you're looking for one on the budget.,0

fabric is thin and has no stretch,"Runs a Bit Small. This dress is light and airy. It's perfect for warmer weather. The fabric is thin and has no stretch.

Easy to do,Five Stars. Easy to do and great for gifts.,1

rice pudding with cherries,Make showstopping desserts on your countertop with minimal effort!. I’m a fairly recent convert to the slow cooker bandwagon I only purchased my first slow cooker a couple of years ago and started out by baking my way through all the desserts in Michele Scicolone’s excellent “The Mediterranean Slow Cooker ” which introduced me to the joys of making flan  cheesecake  and fruit compote in the slow cooker.  Fast forward several years later and I was looking to expand my slow cooker desserts repertoire  so imagine my delight when I got an e-mail from Lisa Ekus that highlighted “Slow Cooker Desserts” by Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore! Roxanne and Kathy are cookbook authors  food consultants  cooking teachers and food bloggers who have written seven cookbooks and a popular blog  www.pluggedintocooking.com.  As soon as my copy of “Slow Cooker Desserts” arrived  I couldn’t wait to dig in to the many inviting recipes covering not only cakes and cheesecakes  but also bread puddings  fruits  and candy and fondues. The book opens with a good compact guide to slow cookers  bakeware  and ingredients. The layout is uncluttered and straightforward  and each recipe is followed by helpful tips  making it perfect for novice bakers. The gorgeous photography by Jennifer Davick deserves a special mention as well.  The first recipe I tried was the Praline-Pumpkin Cheesecake. I decided to substitute a gingersnap crust for the graham crackers  and it added the perfect touch of spice to complement the spices in the cheesecake filling. Note that you do need to blind bake the gingersnap crust prior to baking in the slow cooker  but this only adds a few minutes to the prep time. Also  perhaps it was the brand of gingersnaps I used  but I would recommend adding a little extra melted butter until the crust comes together – the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter for ½ cup crumbs. One thing I would suggest is to also liberally spray the sides of your springform pan as well – mine is supposedly nonstick  but I followed the recipe (which only specifies to spray the bottom of the pan) and a large portion of my cheesecake edges stuck and broke. I normally do spray the entire pan with Baker’s Joy  but I follow the recipes as written when I am testing for reviews.  The finished cheesecake texture is very fluffy and a bit crumbly  so I did have difficulty cutting it neatly I’m not sure if I may have beat TOO much air into my filling and will beat for less next time. The praline topping (made in the microwave in under three minutes) is destined to become my new secret weapon in the kitchen! This homemade caramel was delicious and deceptively easy and would also make a great addition to ice cream or cakes. All combined (gingersnap crust  spiced pumpkin filling  praline topping)  this is a great fall dessert with minimal effort and also frees up your oven for other baking tasks.  The second recipe I tried was the candied cranberry and crystallized ginger chutney this one called my name because I am a certified fiend when it comes to candied ginger. I had a bag of organic cranberries in the freezer that I was looking to use up  so it worked out perfectly that I already had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry (even the ginger liqueur!). My bag of organic cranberries was slightly smaller than the 16-oz. bag called for in the recipe  so I scaled back on the sugar quite a bit as I was using candied ginger (I used ¾ cup sugar in place of the 1 ¼ in the recipe  and it was plenty sweet for me). It also had the bonus of making my kitchen smell amazing as it cooked! I cooked mine down for a little longer the recipe says that it should be thin  but I like my chutney on the very thick side more like a compote. The recipe calls for between 5 to 7 hours on low and I ended up cooking mine for 3 hours on high due to time. This would be fantastic stirred into yogurt  as an accompaniment to Indian food  or even as a side dish in place of jellied cranberries or cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.  The third recipe was the chocolate cashew clusters. I’d seen slow cooker candy (including nut clusters) pop up in my Facebook feed  but I’d never tried making it before. The recipe uses salted cashews  semisweet and milk chocolate chips  a dark chocolate candy bar  and candy coating to create decadent nut clusters that look like they came from a candy shop. These take about 1 ½ hours on low plus cooling / set time (3 to 5 hours).  Other recipes on my to-make list from “Slow Cooker Desserts” include the cinnamon-calvados applesauce  rice pudding with cherries  and many of the cheesecakes (brownie chunk  German chocolate  ginger-peach  coconut cream) and cakes (cider-glazed apple-walnut cake  Southern sweet potato cake  pineapple butter cake). There is enough variety and possible variations (I need to find a way to make a cookie butter cheesecake!) to keep you happily baking for months to come.  (Thank you to Lisa Ekus for the review copy!),1
lip scrub,I really hope this service and products improve in my next box!. I recieved 4 items plus a makeup bag with my first month of this subscription. The description of what is supposed to come in each months box clearly stated that there were supposed to be 5 (five) full sized products  consisting of all lip products and one random makeup item. I received a full sized lip liner  a normal sized lipstick and very small  what I would call sample size lip scrub and eyeshadow. They were extremely small. Also  the lipstick was smudge proof  but remained SO sticky the entire time I wore it. I mean  my lips kept sticking together and even stuck to my napkin when I wiped my mouth. I didn't like it. The price is not bad  and I'm going to continue my subscription for a few more months to see if the products improve  but if they remain consistently poor  then the value isn't actually good for the price and I will cancel.,0

working display shows about two-thirds of a weekday NY Times puzzle grid,"Decent  But Expensive Not Fully Functional on New Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" Tablet. CROSSWORDS by Standalone is a decent crossword puzzle app  but inflexible and expensive.  On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet  the working display shows about two-thirds of a weekday NY Times puzzle grid  and I can't find any way to resize the grid to show the whole puzzle at once. (You must swipe down or hit an arrow button to reveal the lower one-third of the grid.)  The Across and Down clues appear alongside the grid in a readable typeface  but the clues are cut off at the right.  (Perhaps this is an 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD issue that the developer will correct fortunately  clicking on a cut-off clue will display the full clue below the grid.)  The puzzle hints--found under the list icon beside the app icon  at the left--don't always work as expected.  For example  ""reveal entire puzzle"" only filled in one word (for the 1-down clue) when I started from the ""hints for 1-down"" screen.  In contrast  ""reveal entire puzzle"" filled in the entire puzzle when I started from a ""press-and-hold-on-clue"" popup.  Worse  the general settings for navigation (e.g.  ""skip filled squares""  ""show mistakes"") don't seem to function at all.  (Perhaps this is another Kindle Fire HD issue for the developer to fix.)  The app allows you to enter multiple letters in a single square  and to look up puzzle info (must-haves for NY Times crossword solvers).  If you are a NY Times crosswords subscriber  the app will automatically download the daily puzzles for you.  The app comes with an assortment of puzzles already installed  and allows you to browse for and download many more puzzles from the Internet.  It also allows you to establish an account and compare your times with other solvers.  However  the FREE [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] app does nearly all of the same things.  (Crosswords Plus does not download your NY Times subscription puzzles automatically  although it makes it easy to download them daily it doesn't come with puzzles loaded  although it points you to free Internet sources and it doesn't have a feature for comparing scores with other solvers.)  In addition  [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] allows you to resize the grid  offers an alternate clues-only view  includes the usual hints options  and has navigational settings (skipping boxes  etc.) that are fully functional on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet.  Even if this CROSSWORDS app worked perfectly  I would still prefer [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]].  For this reason  and because of the high price and current Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet issues  I rate CROSSWORDS at 3 stars.",0

As a reader of archaeology and paleontology tomes  this magazine is the adjunct to my selections of books to read. My wife and I have planned vacations around Archaeology's articles.  I've detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites.  During a cross country moving event 7 years ago  I let the subscription expire for lack of new address. Someone from Archaeology  not a telemarketer for sure  called me and said that I had been such a long term customer that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew ... was it something about the magazine quality? The voice on the other end was just so dang disappointed as she pleaded for feedback that it was stunning enough for me to remember 7 years later. The magazine must be read by a small but dedicated subscriber base and I think the magazine staff themselves makes the calls.  My only complaint is that it only prints every 2 months.

At first it seemed like it would be nice but it’s it’s only good to help protect it for now. I will be buying something else. No way it will hold up is it’s dropped like it indicates,0
build cities,this is a fun game  some items are really hard to find. this is a fun game  some items are really hard to find but thats the challenge..lol what I dont like is the rest of it you have to build cities read about the people and help them...I just want to find the items not all the rest..good graphics too.,0
fit,Beautiful & Good Quality. I just received this nose ring.  It is very pretty and of good quality.  The heart is a nice size and has a little sparkle to it.  I gave only four stars because of the fit.  It'd be nice if it was a tad bit longer.  I wish nose stud makers would offer a variety of lengths for those of us with slightly larger noses who do not wish to bother with altering fishtails.,0
color is too bright,"Not very protective - More for style. Got this Verso for my new 7"" HD Fire. I found the color bright and a really neon green  probably a little 'too bright' for a 50 something year old woman. I honestly think this color (and I assume the alternate pink as well) is better suited for teenagers. The case is thin and not very protective  though  so I think the idea of giving this to a teenager there may be better (more protective) alternatives. I would say go ahead and spen another $10 and get one of the better cases and skip the style/fashion side of a case for your Kindle.",0
not heavy sweetener,"Great For Rehydrating Especially  After Bout Of ""The Runs"". I have been trying to build up my system with minerals in my water  but not too long ago  I had a bout with the runs- the kind that leave you feeling rather exhausted after a day of running to the bathroom.  I noticed that I was feeling very ill and weak the next day or two  then it dawned on me.  I thought I would try this..  WHAT IS THIS LIKE? This stuff is thickened in a bottle which has a twist of raspberry flavoring added.  It is not sweet  just has a raspberry essence.  There is no sweetener  and the dropper has measuring lines on it.  HOW TO USE THIS? I was so run down when I got thinking about it  I remembered- you can easily get dehydrated when having ""the runs"".  I immediately got out this electrolyte mixture and put a small amount of this (like.25) into a very large glass of water.  I drank it down as gradually as I could and then through the day I added more water.  By the end of the morning  I was feeling TONS better.  This really did help me rehydrate and feel better after being wiped out.  THE BOTTOM LINE This is not hard to take  has just a bit of raspberry flavor  but does help me to rehydrate when I really need help.  I experienced relief greatly after having a bout with ""the runs""  I plan to use a little bit now and then to continue to rehydrate this winter.  MY RATING FOUR STARS.  I love that this helped me through a rough patch when I needed hydration.  I am torn between five and four stars for review.  I am VERY glad there is not heavy sweetener in this like so many things have.  I also am kind of unclear on ingredients or this company.  I also experienced good from it so far  so I am leaving it at FOUR STARS  but REALLY IT IS FOUR AND A HALF.",1
don't come with directions,No directions. The box is super cute and I while the crafts are not the greatest quality  they look cute. The problem is  they don’t come with directions!!! I messaged them and no response so this is a complete bust unfortunately.,0
set up easily,Great solar powered lights at a reasonable price!. For the money these lights are fantastic. I live in a fairly dimly lit community and although crime is minimal I prefer to have some sense of security at night. Being solar powered  I was able to set these up easily myself (without have to call in an electrician). These work great and I have them spaced strategically around the perimeter of my home. They are bright  but not blinding  and the solar battery charge keeps them active all night long. I highly recommend these as an added security feature for your home (at a minimal cost).,1
flush (as I stated they are thicker),Nice  thick  facial tissue. These are a thicker facial tissue  perfect for wetting and wiping down sticky hands and faces. I like to carry them to help keep my makeup in check after a long day wearing mascara and eyeliner. They can also be used for nose blowing and other typical facial tissues  but not sure how well they will flush (as I stated they are thicker). Recommend if you are looking for a stronger tissue to carry with you.,0
vintage-inspired snowball pompom ornaments,"Retro-inspired country Christmas is a walk down memory lane.... ""The Farm Chicks Christmas"" by Serena Thompson is the follow-up to 2009's [[ASIN:1588168662 The Farm Chicks in the Kitchen: Live Well  Laugh Often  Cook Much]]. The first Farm Chicks book was a countrified cookbook peppered liberally with stories and reminiscences by Serena and Teri  antiques-inspired craft ideas (a reusable stencil was included in the front)  and comfort food: easy recipes for breakfast treats  appetizers  soups and salads  and decadent desserts  over fifty in all.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas "" on the other hand  is written only by Serena  a contributing editor for Country Living magazine and antiques show hostess (her best friend Teri has retired from their business). The book still includes numerous country-inspired craft ideas you'll find decorative  retro-inspired self-adhesive gift tags and notecards at the back  along with various decorating ideas for ""the most wonderful time of the year."" However  the ratio of crafts to recipes is reversed from the first book there are only 17 recipes included at the back with gift-giving suggestions on how to package them.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" captures the magic of childhood Christmases  from family visits to the tree farm (complete with recipe ideas for hot drinks to tote along)  holiday decorating ideas (holiday scalloped bunting  vintage-inspired snowball pompom ornaments  cone trees and vintage funnel trees  banners and more)  and photos of Serena's friends' and family's homes decorated for Christmas.  Much of the book is more like a scrapbooked photo essay  with crafts sprinkled in every few pages. Also  the decorating tips (and included photos) are vintage country in the Farm Chicks fashion: displaying old farm toys standing in coconut snow  for example  or stacking metal funnels to make ""trees."" If you're not a fan of all things country  this probably isn't the holiday book for you.  The included holiday recipes are few  and aimed mostly at gift-giving  like the sweet and salty nuts  mini orange bundt cakes  and various types of cookies (butter cutouts  chocolate-covered peanut butter balls  snowballs  Spritz cookies). As with the previous book  a handy list of metric equivalent charts is provided at the back. I tried the sweet and salty nuts recipe first  and though tasty  I didn't think that the ""sweet"" flavor predominated it was more of a subtle afterthought (there's only 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of honey for 3 cups of nuts).  Overall  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" is a nostalgic walk down a snowy memory lane  but it has narrower mass appeal than ""Farm Chicks in the Kitchen"" due to the reversal of the recipe-to-crafts ratio and the genre-specific decorating style (I enjoyed the many beautiful photographs  but won't find myself making yarn-ball wreaths or filling jars with spare Christmas lightbulbs anytime soon).

biased towards the west coast,Still not very good. I had a subscription to this magazine a few years ago. I let my sub run out because the magazine was not that good. I decided to give it another try and see if this magazine had improved. Nope  still the same old magazine. The gear reviews always seem to review the high end gear that only a small percentage of people can afford.   The articles are usually about hiking trails that are the top tier trails. PCT  AT  CDT  etc. How about some trails that are in different states that do not take MONTHS to finish! Some nice weekend trails would be awesome!! Seems like this magazine has always been biased towards the west coast. You know  there are many  many other trails in the US  across all 50 States!! Not just CA!  So  looks like this sub will be just like the first time I subbed. Going to let it expire. I can find better content on youtube anyways!,0
quality no better than cheap gloves,Not small enough for me.... Sadly  I have super tiny hands  and that makes it incredibly difficult to find proper motorcycle gloves that fit and offer good protection. I got a pair of XS gloves and they were still too big. However  they are the closest I've come to fitting me properly from any gloves I've gotten  so I will give a star for that. The palms are fine  but the fingertips are way too long.  Sizing apart  the quality of the gloves are no better than you'd expect from cheap gloves. Sadly due to the sizing issue  it's hard to find the right size in any quality so I try to make due with what I can get. The knuckles are hardened  but not with that hard rubberized material other high quality gloves have. The rest of the glove is rather thin but flexible. While it's nice to have that extra mobility  I wouldn't trust these in a high speed fall. These would fall apart. For driving around town  these should be more than enough. And with the touch phone fingertips  it can be pretty convenient when quickly checking something on your phone.  These are the gloves I'm using now  and so far with light use  they have been holding up just fine. I'll update if anything comes up over time.,0
heartwarming,Good read. New author to me. This is a great read..emotional and heartwarming.,1
Shoes are off by a size,Cute shoe  size down. Shoes are off by a size  way too big.,0
exploded in shipping,Exploded in shipping. Waited awhile for these not shipping fault there was a major ice storm in TX BUT I do not see a place to contact seller as two of the ginger ones ( the ones I really wanted ) exploded in my box 😢,0
no tones,Meh. I had ordered for a fair complexion and was sent make up to make me look black and white ...  no tones...no colors.,0
actual healthy options,Disappointed. I have been getting the snack boxes for about a year now. When they first started they had a nice variety of healthy options that were different from usual snack fare. The last four boxes however have been a huge disappointment. I have even gotten the same product three months in a row. And the snacks seem to have degraded from actual healthy options to “health halo” options such as natural potato chips. After having been extremely disappointed for the third month in a row now  I am cancelling my subscription. I wouldn’t even recommend this unless you like getting the same things over and over.,0
far too hard,Eh. Both rabbits did not like and they are far too hard,0
noise cancelling could be better,Purchased for Telecommuting. I originally purchased these headphones as I needed something that would connect to both my  computer and my cellphone for attending online meetings at home.  The sound is very clear and I like the ease of adjusting the volume right on the earpiece. But the mic has a delay so it is tough to get the attention of coworkers when you have a point with the delay. I estimate the delay is 2-3 seconds as that is how long the pause is when I get a response back during a call.  They also could be better at noise cancelling but my home is pretty quiet so that isn't a big issue for me. I don't use it for gaming so I did not give that a rating.,0
AirPod charger charges very slow,Weak Magnet. This charges a phone very quickly but that is about the only positive thing about it.  The magnet is not very strong at all.  Barely holds onto a 14 pro max with a MagSafe case on it.  Barely bumped the phone will fall.  Works a little better with a 14 mini.  The AirPod charger charges very slow even though it gets the AirPods very warm.,0
salt takes a toll,touch and hold smooth dual door closer system. Husband purchased these to replace some others that had given up the ghost.  We live on the oceanfront and the salt takes a toll.  These are nice because you can do it with your foot (when install at the base of the door) just tap it and it stays open  tap again and it releases.  Easy Peasy.  He prefers these and says they are easy to install.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes. Bottom line  I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,0
Beautiful,Five Stars. Beautiful  just what I wanted.,1
literary essays,Too religious. I wanted to enjoy literary essays  stories  and articles  but it seems like every issue I received this last year is packed full of a religious agenda of one variety or another.  To be sure  the themes seem to be an eclectic variety of spiritual and cultural mysticism  but the magazine never just leaves it out.  It's always a tome espousing some collection of beliefs  cultural systems  and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence using religious narratives  symbols  and sacred histories or allusions from one or another.  Everytime I read it  I feel like I'm being proselytized.,0
erratic story line,Poorly done (decent cast  poor plot  erratic story line and not very nice characters). Truly poor - shallow  poorly developed & unlikeable characters who didn’t seem to even like each other.  A bride who showed zero concern for her missing groom-to-be throughout the entire movie.  Poor script  weak plot and over-the-top acting.  This is drivel & a waste of time to watch.  I've read many 'cosy mysteries' and this movie tries to bring one to the screen  but the entire plot is poorly developed and the characters are unreal.  For example  one character goes from making love to her old boyfriend who soon afterwards pushes her off a cliff allegedly because she had previously broken up their relationship.  Not even soap opera good.,0
loved the themes and characters included,The kids were THRILLED!. Came upon this on Amazon and thought I'd give it a try. And let me tell you  it was the best $25 spent in a long time! We kept it up on top of the dining room cabinet as an incentive and let them each (2 boys  7&9) close their eyes and pick an item in place of allowance/grocery store toys/etc. for completing weekly home school and chores. Each time they were both thrilled and played nicely together with the little items. While our 1st kit did not include a stuffed toy (I had hoped for one) they loved the themes and characters included.,1
don't last long,These charging cables start out great  but don't last long. The cables start out great  but don't last long.  The male part of the cable ends up not fitting well into the phone.  I don't know if something wears out or what actually happens  but it stops charging due to fit.,0
level of detail,Beautifully-crafted puzzle will provide hours of entertainment. I had the luck of visiting Portofino last October  and was instantly hooked on this 1 000-piece Ravensburger puzzle that perfectly captures the vibrant colors and Mediterranean atmosphere of the town. The framing of the photo is interesting as well  with several moored boats in the foreground and the harbor in the background. The level of detail in the high-resolution photo is amazing (the finished puzzle measures 27 X 20). The puzzle pieces are sturdy (unlike some cheaper puzzles I've assembled) and nonglare.  This is a fabulous challenge to have on hand for weekends or relaxation the large amount of blue in the water and sky make these more difficult sections to accomplish  but the end result is well worth the effort!,1
sleep headphones,Bringing sweet dreams. The sleep headphones are an awesome product!! I have a pair of my own and this pair was for my pregnant daughter who's been having problems sleeping  with the sleep headphones she's been able to block out excessive noise and relax to her choice of music while falling asleep comfortably. We both recommend this product 5 stars,1
fluffy blue poms,fluffy blue poms. These were a very lovely decoration for a baby boy shower we had.  They are a tiny bit tricky to put together... take your time and be careful when fluffing them out... you'll be fine.  They arrive flat.  The colors represented are accurate and are what we got.  A selection of sizes and colors.  Used them all.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.  Further  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.  My purchases are VERIFIED  full price paid  and completely independent purchases.  100%.  As are my reviews.  I always try to respond to all questions/comments.  Happy shopping to all!,1
heavy feeling,"print dress with pockets. I am 5'8""... 38DDD... usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  I purchased the black floral print.  First  the obvious... the sizing is WAY off.  Super too small.  If you have a chest at all - pass.  The elastic waist fits like an empire waist... the pockets are way too high (because it's too small) and oddly  the print material has a slight sheen to it... unlike the other photos I saw of the non-print.  It's heavy feeling and in weight.  The tag notes 95% Rayon 5% Spandex.  - feels like it.  There is some stretch - but the sleeves were uncomfortably snug - and way too snug across the chest.  The tag notes machine wash - but no dryer - hand dry and light iron if necessary.  Made in China.  Honestly  if you're a women of curves - as I am  I would NOT recommend this even in the 2x - it's just too small.  It's disappointing that the sizing is so off.  But having said that - I am not really a fan of the way the material feels and looks.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful  however  I am donating this dress - so there's not much more to say.  Hope this info helps you.",0
most dogs love these,Quality dog treat  unfortunately my dog didn't care for them.. All in all  this is a good dog treat. With no wheat  soy  corn or preservatives  I would feel confident in feeding them to my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix Roxie. Unfortunately  she didn't like them. Maybe the fact that these are cranberry/oat variety and not something with chicken or beef  turned her away. However  you can't judge the quality of this product by my dog as she has a tendency to be very picky when it comes to any food. I have read other reviews here and I see that most dogs love these  so I am rating them as 4 stars simply based on the quality of the product and its ingredients.,1
low quality,Low quality. Easy to use but is a low quality product.,0
lost tweezers,Fun w resin crafts!. Seriously. I bought these bc they popped upon sale while I was looking at resin or resin molds. I had no earthly idea what it was even for! Lol. It’s a total impulse buy.  That said I am very happy with it. Though I’ve already lost my tweezers. I think I accidentally threw them out with my used resin cups. I put some infuse my resin jewelry around some dried flowers & it’s just lovely. It was my very first foray into resin jewelry. I’ll try to post the pic. It’s super easy to work with & I have no idea what to use the rest for. It’s a lot of product. Pleasantly surprised with this purchase.,0
looks like a $150 cover,For the cost it's nice  but not enough for me. Bought for my 2021 Silverado Z71. It was easy to install and worked well enough. It looks like a $150 cover though. I just couldn't put it on such a nice truck and feel okay about it. I ended up with something much higher quality. If you want an easy cheap cover though  this is a good choice.,0
value for the money,Value added box. It indeed was value for the money spent. Looking forward to the next box,1
disappointed,Nice  but don't expect a snow globe!. Was disappointed when I had to reorder it because it got lost then itcame(the 1st one) so I had to send it back. Was also disappointed because I thought it was a real snow globe. Should have read up on it. My fault.,0
light blanket not held up,Good idea  not at all sturdy. This is not sturdy. Falls apart way too easily. A light blanket is not even able to be held up with it. Any little bump breaks it apart. Such a great idea  but needs to be much stronger to function.,0
Elvis fan,She loved Elvis's movies growing up  she still loves the original soundtrack albums. Purchased as a Christmas gift some years ago for my younger sister  our extended family's biggest Elvis fan.  She loved the Elvis musicals growing up (especially It Happened at the World's Fair  Viva Las Vegas  Roustabout  and Girl Happy)  and tuned them in anytime they were being shown on television.  She had collected most of the soundtrack LPs (or 8-tracks  or cassettes) but hadn't gone the CD replacement route  except for her favorites in the Double Feature series.  So  here we are  Elvis for Christmas one more time.  Needless to say  she was / is thrilled with the boxset  absolutely loves it keeps it on prominent display on a special Elvis shelf in her music room.  And she regularly keeps the discs in heavy rotation.  The full five-star rating and highly recommended for the true Elvis fanatics in your life.,1
disappointed,Save your money!. The toys are like fifty cent quality  With six dollars or so of kibble. Disappointed!,0
wish there had been a more neutral color option,dining room chair cushions. I have some very  very hard wood dining room chairs.  They have very large seats.  I have been looking for cushions that would fit for months.  Now.  As you can see by the pics I have provided  they do not go all the way to the end of the seat portion of the chair.  However  we you sit on them  the cushion &#34spreads&#34 to the edge  so you don't feel the edge of the chair.  They are approximately 1 1/2&#34 to 2&#34 thick. They are just enough cushioning.  The blue is a sort of a turquoise... definitely not a marine blue  - I think the pic I provided pretty accurately shows the color.  The only other color option was a green.  I do wish there had been a more neutral color option... a dark tan... a chocolate brown?  I do think you could turn the cushions over.  The ties are sewn well and strong.  The design is sort of quilted in look and in texture - it is the same on both sides. The tags say &#34made in the USA with imported/USA materials.&#34  As for cleaning.. it says spot cleaning only. Fill and cover are listed as 100% polyester.  I do like that they are water and fade resistant.  Even though I am using them inside  perhaps they will stand up to little more use. I never hesitate to update my review should new info seem useful.,0
perfect for dress wear or for casual times,Great earrings for every day! A must have for all women!. For the price  these earrings are a great deal. Perfect size  well made and very attractive  I have been wearing them almost every day since I have received them. These are perfect for dress wear or for casual times  large enough to be noticed but not heavy or cumbersome on the ears. I love the sparkle. Highly recommend these for every woman to keep a pair in her wardrobe!,1
gift,Three Stars. THIS WAS ALSO A GIFT. . .DIDN'T WATCH IT. . .,0
many functions and options,Best diffusers available and cheap. I bought two more for my mother and mother in law. Love that you dont have to refill it all the time.  The large tank lasts forever. The remote is a bonus. So many functions and options. This is a great difuser for a low price.,1
gimmick,Not impressed. This product is fine but does not really do anything. It does fizz a bit but my pucks did not even fully dissolve. No incredible smells or amazing cleaning. Seems more of a gimmick than anything.,0
outside antenna,Need expertise to install. I've kept this for months because I like the IDEA of it  but you have to drill  through your roof and put in an outside antenna.  It's way too complex so it's still in the box.  Looks well made.  Instructions might as well be in a foreign language.  Electrician won't install it due to drilling through roof.  So .....,0
appear well made,Kids love them. Great silicone plates for kids. Deep sections that hold a lot of food. Kids love them and enjoy an assortment of food with each meal. They appear well made and are easy to clean.,1
fit me perfectly,Socks come over knee the strong compression makes them uncomfortable on me for all day wear. I love the color of these compression socks. I ordered the small/medium size even though I should have ordered a large because I take a size 9 to 9.5 shoe. Nevertheless  these fit me perfectly and the large would have been too big. The compression is strong  so I do find these difficult to wear all day.  The only thing I do not like about these socks is that they come up to my lower thighs which requires me to fold them over to get them below my knees.,1
NOT BREWORO,False advertising. NOT BREWORO. False advertising. NOT BREWORO,0
neck was way too big,Poor fit. The neck was way too big. He couldn’t wear.,0
stems,Nice range in colors  but flimsy shafts.. The package was nicely divided and orderly  and the array of colors/textures (flavors) is very delightful  says my cat. However  as I was affixing clasps to the feather spine shafts to make toys for my cat  they keep breaking with very little pressure applied by myself.  While I realize these are craft feathers  the stems should not be so fragile and hollow that they have very little support to last for whatever project they are being used for (you can crush them between two fingers very easily). That's the ONLY reason why I subtracted stars.,0
explanation of what’s in the box for parents,Very Happy Kid.. I got this as a surprise for my 8-year-old  and he loves it. He is constantly asking if he can do some coding  and he just loves doing the work and playing with the results. I’m also a fan they include an explanation of what’s in the box for parents and the materials are so clear that I can easily jump in and help if he hits a snag.,1
loofah,This is a great gift set!!!!. This gift set is a steal at under $25. It contains deep moisture body wash  deodorant dry spray  Intensive Repair Shampoo  Intensive Repair Conditioner  Macadamia and Rice Milk Body Polish and a loofah. If you were to purchase all of these separately you would run over $40. I love the way my skin feels after using these in the shower and part of my morning routine for the past month now. I particularly love the body polish. I highly recommend and can say with the boxing  this would make a fantastic present for the holidays. Highly recommend!,1
octave happens at 12th feet,Cool fuzz. Very cool octave fuzz. Octave happens at 12th feet. Gets even crazier when stacked with an OD. And the little toggle switch really changes the fuzz tone.,1
fudgy New Fishbein Brownies,“There is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”. Susie Fishbein’s bestselling series “Kosher By Design” goes out with a bang with the final ninth volume “Kosher By Design Brings It Home.” Inspired by Susie’s travels to France  Italy  Mexico  Israel  and North America  you’ll find kosher versions of favorites such as Korean short ribs  lasagna bolognaise  and shoyu tamago ramen (which normally has a pork-based broth here in Japan).  I have several kosher cookbooks that I cook from regularly (Including The Joy of Kosher and “The New Kosher”)  but this was my first experience with the “Kosher By Design” series.  The menu leans most heavily towards Israeli and Italian dishes  including staples like arancini (fried stuffed risotto)   ravioli  Tuscan bean and farro soup  veal scallopini  brachiole  (fried) pizza Napolitana  ragu Napolitano  and lasagna  but you’ll also find Asian-inspired dishes (short ribs  spicy kim chee hangar steaks   ramen  chicken adobo) and Latin flair in the form of chicken flautas  ceviche  and pulled beef tacos.  The salads and dairy / fish sections were particular favorites of mine. I love light  refreshing salads for nearly every meal  and the Israeli-inspired salads here are perfect for hot  hazy days when you don’t feel like spending hours at the stove. I loved the Provencal wheatberry salad  Lumina market salad  Carmel Spa pomegranate almond salad (I use pomegranate molasses as a salad dressing and was happy to see it in a recipe!)  kale squash Caesar salad  root vegetable apple salad  and Chedva’s warm French potato salad was a revelation: baby potatoes  haricots verts  and a tangy white wine-herb dressing made this memorable (to make it dairy  you can add crumbled feta while warm).  Poultry includes rosemary lavender chicken  Amalfi sage chicken  and mustard caper chicken  and the meat dishes include various roasts  grills  and stews: pumpkin braised short ribs are perfect for fall  while the lamb cholent “cassoulet” reminded me of my trip to France’s Perigord in 2012. Dairy dishes include decadent bread pudding  farroto  pasta frittata  and risotto  while the fish dishes really shone: I loved the silan-glazed salmon (see photo) and the showstopping citrus-glazed salmon  layered with rows of perfectly symmetrical cucumber slices atop a citrus mayo. I also enjoyed trying my hand at the khachapuri shakshuka having taught many students from Georgia  I’d long heard of the magic of khachapuri but had never tried making it before. Susie’s clear instructions (and the easy shakshuka topping save the extra for omelettes and scrambled eggs!) make this a winner for breakfast or brunch.  Vegetarians have many options in the sides chapter  including a beautiful (and deceptively simple) eggplant and tomato tart (see photo)  tershi and couscous (I’m a fan of all things pumpkin and had not heard / tried this amazing Libyan Jewish dish before)  sweet potato wontons with teriyaki dipping sauce  chestnut tomato quinoa  and freekeh pilaf. Desserts are sure to tempt with a delightfully sweet/tart lemon tiramisu  Beresheet Spa Kanafe  banana  date  and pecan cake  almond bobka ring  halvah baklava  and fudgy New Fishbein Brownies punched up with espresso powder. Recipes are clearly labeled as meat  dairy or pareve (with some having multiple options depending on dairy-free substitutions) using color-coded icons. Note that some spellings use the Hebrew / Ashkenazi variations (chummos for hummus  seviche for ceviche  bobka for babka  etc.). I love that the font is a little larger and easily readable from several feet away as I tend to cook using a cookbook holder (and the ingredients are handily in bold). Each recipe comes with a full-page photo by John Uher showcasing each dish. The recipes (main dishes in particular) tend to be more elegant / upscale than some of my other kosher cookbooks (dishes like dried fruit and quinoa stuffed capons  turkey breast with hoisin tangerine glaze  and pumpkin braised short ribs would all make wonderful holiday centerpieces)  but there are also plenty of recipes that come together quickly for weeknight meals (the eggplant and tomato tart  fish dishes  and veggie sides).  Overall  “Kosher by Design Brings It Home” is a wonderful finale to Susie’s best-selling series (with nearly 500 000 books sold) and a great way to taste the world from the comfort of your (kosher) kitchen Susie’s headnotes introduce the reader to places and people she’s encountered on her fifteen-year culinary journey spanning several continents and multiple food traditions  from Italian nonnas to Yemenite family recipes passed down across generations. But at the end of the day  in Susie’s words  “there is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”  (Thank you to the Trina Kaye Organization for the review copy!),1
falls apart easily,Good idea  not at all sturdy. This is not sturdy. Falls apart way too easily. A light blanket is not even able to be held up with it. Any little bump breaks it apart. Such a great idea  but needs to be much stronger to function.,0
bent in half,Boo !. This comes in A very nice sturdy box. What I find interesting is Since this is a brand new unopened box I was not expecting any damages. I have Shown 2 pictures of how the pc are coming out of the bag. Quite a few pc were bent in half Or the ends were starting to split. And I would say out of a thousand pieces  a hundred were stuck together very tight. I didn't like having to take them apart because since they were so tight I had to damage some of the pc. In spite of that The printing is very clear on the pc And the coloring is good.,0

color is nice and vibrant,A Good Basic Apron Set. The apron & hat set is a good  basic apron set. The fabric is mid-weight - not too heavy & stiff  but also not too flimsy either. It adjusts easily for a good fit. Each pocket on the apron is about the size of my hand. I would prefer if the pockets were a little lower on the apron & if they were just a little wider. I'm not particularly short  (I'm 5'6&#34) but I had to adjust the apron quite a bit so that the ties hit my waistline. I'm sure if I didn't have to adjust it so much  the location of the pockets would be lower. The color is nice & vibrant. In addition to the matching adjustable hat  there was a coordinating pot holder  too.,1
'touch screen',Nixplay 10.1 touch screen digital picture frame. I purchased this digital frame on a treasure truck deal - it  works.  You will have to load the app and follow directions to bluetooth transfer pics you choose from your gallery to the frame.  I purchased an additional memory chip - but it turns out there is no place to install the chip so don't waste your time there.  You can set a regular time to 'run' the frame or manually turn it off and/or on.  You can 'shuffle' OR play all your uploaded pics.  You do not get to choose the 'fade' that happens between pics  but you do get to choose how long each pic stays on the frame before moving to the next pic. Picture quality is pretty good - about as good as the pics you download on to it.  It's close to an 8x10 frame.  Not sure why they call it a 'touch screen' cause I can't figure out what you can do by touching the screen - but ok. It comes with charging cord  regular plug in - there appears to be a mini USB port  but I haven't tried it.  Having said all this I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,0
lean forward instead of backward,"nice set. id give it 5 stars except i dont like how the phones sit in the chargers  they lean forward instead of backward including the base  i hope these live longer than my last set  i lost display on each of them  by dropping them  people drop things panasonic  you should make them a bit more sturdy and i know they have a ""rugged""  one but 60 for one handset is a bit ridiculous too",0

Ingredients missing,"Just no.... It was .99 which was the only reason I purchased it. As a collector somewhat of kindle cookbooks I am always on the lookout for great cookbooks on sale.

new games taken away,TOO tight. Up side.... 1.not a lot of ads... except to buy tokens Down side.... 1. SUPER tight payouts... (cause they want you to buy tokens  right?) but that makes you less likely to play 2.  Once a day &#34gift&#34 tokens... VERY small - most of the time used in 2 spins 3.  They bring in new games and then take them away... so far  the really fun games! 4.  A bunch of &#34high roller&#34 games that are ridiculous to play unless you buy millions of tokens  so they are a waste 5.  Even after &#34buying&#34 tokens they STILL don't pay out any better and STILL accost you with ads to buy more tokens. 6.  The worst part is that in order to make an &#34account&#34 so you don't loose you purchased tokens you MUST allow them access to your facebook!!! You would think if you'd purchased tokens you could set up using an email.. I got the msg after trying to set up with my gmail  &#34We are currently not allowing account setups with gmail.&#34  - or any other email. So I guess when I run out of the tokens I bought I will just uninstall. BEWARE of &#34unhelpful&#34 votes as they are likely the seller that doesn't like that you are providing honest reviews.,0
bad shape,It wasn't worth it !!. Well it was worth a shot ! But I gotta pass cause as you can see from beginning to end the last photo its not looking good   my plant arrived in bad shape and the driver left the box upside down ( no way to tell which end was up ) after getting it planted I was hoping it would make it 😬but its dieing 😭slowly its going the process of shipping was just to hard for it so I wont be continuing my Subscription 😞 2 leafs left barely hanging on !! I really think the care given to the plant during shipping was crap ! Maybe a brighter box like orange or red with a warning or fragile ! For shippers to take notice idk but the box was just thrown around like all the rest ! The box was dented   you could see it was not handled well ! So try the service if you want but thats my story 🙏🌿🌱🌵🍀🙏,0
useless mouse extension,I use mine as a percussion stand. I've purchased a few of these from different brands. Although the design is fairly generic some are better than others. This one is sturdier than the last one I purchased from a different brand  but for what I use it sturdiness not not so much a factor. I have mine set up near my drums with maracas  claves  and the such. No problem there. I did test it with my Levovo T400 laptop and it was sturdy enough to type on  but the 'mouse extension' was pretty useless. Of course I didn't purchase it for that feature.  The included bag is more functional than the bags that come with some of my other stands  so that's a plus. A word about having multiple stands: I have one in my rehearsal studio  another in al alternate studio  and one on my vehicle for when I am performing live. Of the three - all in this price range - this is my favorite.  If you are planning to use a heavy projector  you may want to move to the next higher tier of stands. I am not sure that this one will meet your needs. If you are a musician  though  this is perfect for hand percussion instruments  probably mouthpieces and the such  or a place for other small tools and instruments.,0

made of all plant-based ingredients,Lightweight moisturizer absorbs rapidly leaves skin moderately hydrated smells lemony. Even though this is baby lotion  I got this for me. This moisturizer is lightweight  slightly creamy  absorbs rapidly  and leaves my skin moderately hydrated. Since it is lightweight  it is a perfect summer lotion. To my senses  it has a mild lemony fragrance even though that is not listed in the ingredients. This is made of all plant-based ingredients (see photo). The current price of $16 is competitive but pricey for this 6.7 ounce tube.,0
stick to the topic,Very good. But.. He is very entertaining and systematic. I lowered to 3 stars because of his essentialistic Eurocentric argument that Western music has essentially universal appeal simply because of its qualities and not at all because of political and military domination.

"look is ""modern""",Nice clean sound and a comfortable fit.. These actually look pretty good and fit really well.  Pros: Sound is clean and powerful. Fit is tight enough to walk (or slow jog) in if you wanted to but not too tight. The ear pads are comfortable enough that you don't really notice them. Microphone works well with Iphone 6. And Nexus 7. Others I have talked to said I sounded clear. After initial Bluetooth setup/connection they sync up pretty quick. Look is &#34modern&#34. Initially I wasn't that fond of the look but they look better in person than in pictures.  Cons: Bass it a bit light but not real noticeable. They are a bit loud. If turned up high the sound reverberates around you. Lights blink on the side and can be annoyingly bright if it's dark.,0
waistband may roll down a bit,Runs a Bit Small. These are good leggings for all types of workouts. The fabric is very soft and stretchy. There's good tummy control.

I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,0
CD had copied meta data,"Many  Many Issues and Possibly a Fake Reproduction.. 3 of the 14 discs in this collection did not play in multiple CD players and would either not play at all or skip entirely.

top 50 reviewer #30,Reusable christmas boxes. These are flatter reusable christmas boxes with magnetic flaps.  They are sturdy and pretty.  We reuse them for years - these look like they will last - but time will tell!  We use wired ribbon and reuse it too.   Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - nearly 6 000 reviews posted  viewed over 50 000 times  and over 24 000 likes. I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,1
nice bag,Cute!. This is a cute clear purse. It's definitely a better alternative to the sporty looking clear bags out there. I did have some difficulties attaching the strap to the bag. The clasp was hard to get into the grommet and I ended up getting my finger caught at one point. Other than that  it's a nice bag and will work well for an upcoming concert I am attending.,1
metal snap,Grumbles. And here we have another product that I am still not thrilled with your hair and your hair is close to yourself and what happens when the plastic cap comes off the end and the metal snap and now you have a big chunk of metal poking you in the head yeah I'm not happy at all I have not even contacted the vendor because I don't want sound mean to them how upset I am with the quality that is not here. Replacement would be nice,0

shipping dates moved around,"Mixed blessing  but so far  so good. I looked at probably 20 portable ice makers before choosing this one. Price was a factor  but so was customer input from reviews. It seemed like many of the other models were the exact same machine with a different company label stuck on them  and their reviews were so varied  it seemed like you either got a lemon or a good one.  Also  all the others opened at the top and vented on the side. For some reason  I thought this one would work better in our area  with the drawer pulling out at the front  and I THOUGHT the vent would be at the side like all the other machines.  My purpose in buying this is not for a bar or camper  like many people. I am partially disabled  and can't get downstairs to the kitchen on any sort of regular basis. I really wanted to be able to have ice when I wanted some  especially with the heat of summer rolling in very  very soon. I don't like room temperature drinks  esp water or tea  so I'd found myself drinking Pepsi almost exclusively  the only thing I could stand at room temp. That needed to stop!  So  I ended up buying this one  but the experience was not a pleasant one. I love my Amazon prime dearly  but they really botched this one. The shipping dates got moved around even after I paid extra for one-day shipping  and ended up with this being delivered on a totally different day  when I was the only one home and could not come to the door. (Note that Amazon did end up giving me a small credit on my acct to try to make up for the shipping problem  even though it did not solve my problem.) I always chat with the UPS guys through the upstairs window  so they left it for me anyway. I knew my son would be home very shortly after  and he was. He brought the box up  and I have to say that I am almost positive I got a customer return. The box looked like it had previous shipping labels peeled off of it. The box was beat up  torn  and had a crushed in spot on the side. Our UPS guys are really great  so I think it was shipped out from Day One looking like that - who in the warehouses think customers really want something that looks that bad?! (And yes  I know this is a product review section  and I can file shipping problems elsewhere  and I will. Just giving folks a heads-up of how it is shipped and what I received.) This is shipped in its original mfg box with tie cords on it  there is no other packaging other than what the mfg sends it out with - no Amazon packaging whatsoever. Strike One.  I opened the box  not sure of what I would find. It only has two big strips of styrofoam on the sides to hold it. Ours indeed had a dent in the side  and one of the back exhaust fans had cracked plastic. Not a crisis  but at this price  I really do expect a brand new item in great condition! Strike Two.  SMELLS/TASTE: I read a lot of reviews that talk about the plastic smell and/or taste in the cubes  and how it didn't seem to want to fire up well. IF someone reads the directions (not everyone likes to do that!)  you'd see it says to make sure the machine sits for at least an hour to allow the coolant to properly settle back into place after you unpack it. This particular model also says to run a bleach solution through it to help clean it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT!! The machine indeed smells heavily of plastic. Anyone who has had a relay switch burn out on an item knows what smell I am talking about - sort of like melting plastic. Ugh. However  having read plenty about portable ice makers before buying one  I knew that either vinegar or lemon juice would also work just fine. I chose to go with one that was ingestible  rather than bleach!! We did the lemon juice  and ran an entire cycle of cubes through it with the lemon/water. (Toss the ice please!) I then ran two loads (all the cubes a full water tank would make) through it of plain water. AFTER those cycles  I wiped it out again and ran regular water through it to try making cubes we'd use. We had no problems at all with any funny tastes in our ice this way. If you have a bad quality of tap water though  I'd suggest using either bottled  filtered or distilled water. It is only natural that your cubes will not taste better than your tap water. Ours is okay  so we're good that way. I would have bought a water filter (like a Brita) if that had not been the case. No lemony taste  no plastic taste  no gross tastes or odors at all. (Remember  I really do NOT recommend using bleach like the mfg suggests. While I understand the germ-killing properties of the bleach  I really don't want to ingest any of it. I would also think it would be much more caustic to the plastic parts and hoses of the machine  wearing them out sooner. Stick with lemon juice.) It did smell like plastic out the exhaust fan for quite a while  but it is fading away.  NOISE: Of course it is going to make noise. This has a compressor  and it will be making some noise. However  I've found that at its noisiest part of the cycle  it is no different than a microwave oven running  sometimes a little quieter.The ice cubes dumping make me jump a little bit  at least at first  but then again I am easily startled. Made the cats jump too! LOL! However  they are pretty much used to it now  even if they eyeball it suspiciously while it is running.  I have to say that I haven't stopped to time an actual cycle to make the ice. I've tried the small  medium and large cubes though. They are all gumdrop-shaped (or like the Dots candy at the movies)  with a hole in the middle of the bottom. It didn't seem to take very long though. The small ones were a little too small for my uses  but would be good for smaller drink glasses. I use a [[ASIN:B003X46LHG Bubba Brands Keg 52 Oz Mug Slate Gray]] to hold the ice at the moment  and love it. If you use the medium size  you can get the first batch in around 10 minutes  but the other batches do seem to take longer for some reason. It has also seemed to get ""stuck"" where it runs and runs  with nothing going on. I turn it off  let it sit a minute and push start again  and off it goes. I am not sure if it is just my machine with the dents from rough handling  or if all of this model is like that.  I was disappointed that this unit does not exhaust on the side  reason being where I planned to locate it  on a table behind my bed! It would vent towards my pillow  which is just not gonna happen. So  I have it turned sideways so it will vent towards the doorway. It makes opening the ice drawer more awkward  and makes me wish I'd tried one of the top-opening models now. There wasn't anything in the photos and such to suggest that this unit would be different than most of the other portable ice makers. It is. I'll post photos at a later date.  This model's book also suggests plugging the machine in to a GFI outlet  or grounded plug that will shut off if it senses dampness. I don't have one in the bedroom  and currently am using a heavy-duty  three-prong extension cord and plugging it in in the bathroom  where we do have a GFI plug. Not ideal  but better than trying to get a special outlet installed in a rented bedroom.  The scoop is VERY tiny. It works best to scoop towards you  so you don't send ice cubes back into the machine. The measuring cup works well for pouring  because you have a small reservoir to fill  and you have to go over a small clear rubber ""wall"" that helps to hold the drawer in place and hold temperatures.  Any unused ice does indeed melt back into the reservoir and is recycled back into cubes. Once I have enough ice for anyone who wants it  I turn it off rather than let it continually cycle. I also unplug it in the evenings when I go to bed for the night  since I'm the only one who can't go downstairs for ice if they want it. I hope that saves on the ""vampire electricity"" of the unit. Note that this is not a refrigerated ice maker  and the unused ice WILL melt. Many people complained about ice cubes stuck together - I've only experienced that when getting ice that has been done for an hour or so (it keeps the ice for at least an hour after the last cycle at this point) - otherwise  the cubes are all loose and easy to use. If you try to take the ice drawer all the way out after leaving the ice sit for a while  it WILL leak water on you - the water is simply the ice melting back and going through the drain holes that let it run back into the reservoir. (Nope - I didn't even think about the drainage holes when I pulled the drawer out the first time  and had water on the table and the floor. That was my fault though.)  For now  I am mostly happy with it. I cannot tell you how nice it is to have ice when I want it  instead of waiting for someone to get home in the evening and get me some! It was an expensive luxury though  and one I really thought long and hard about getting since I can no longer work. I'm thinking I really want to keep it. The cosmetic issues were VERY annoying  since I paid for a new machine  not a used one  but in this case  I blame Amazon for sending this out with a crushed box from the get-go. I would not have accepted it  had I been able to get to the door and saw it. Again - for some reason  this was the most problematic purchase I've ever had in all my time on Amazon.  This machine has not reached Strike Three yet  but you can be sure I'll come back and update my review should that happen. For now  I'll keep running it  and see how it seems to work  dents  cracked exhaust grid and all. (The dents are even more annoying  because it has a stainless steel appearance. It shows readily. It was more of a hassle to return it than to just keep it  as long as it continues to work.)  UPDATE June 29  2012: Well  I've had this machine for a little over a month now. Is it perfect? Nope. Does it make ice? Yep. Does it make a little noise?  Yep  but not unbearable. So far  the broken parts do not seem to be affecting the basic function of the machine. While I still have not literally timed the cube cycle (I have good intentions  but seems like there's always something better to do than watch the clock for ice cubes to drop! Ha!)  I have found the medium cubes to be the most useful. In fact  I often use an empty Sobe Lifewater bottle to make quick tea (loving the new tea from Lipton with the honey in it)  and the medium cubes fit in this bottle perfectly. So  that might give folks a better idea about the size of the medium cube. The difference in the sizes are basically more (or less) layers of ice on the cubes. The small ones are still too big for a basic 16.9 oz water bottle  and melt too fast when I shake up my tea. The first batch of the day takes around 10 minutes  but for some reason  they are skinnier than the normal mediums. The machine makes additional batches inbetween 10-15 minutes. Around 2 or 2-1/2 of the water cup it comes with to fill the reservoir to maximum. That will fill the ice bin to the top with medium cubes.  At this point  I increased my stars by one  because of the function of the machine  and it being willing to do what I ""hired"" it to do - keep me in cold drinks. Strike three has not yet happened  and I hope it doesn't! Enjoy!",0

lack a feature that many other sound-resistant headphones include,Not painful  after long periods of use as some others are. Update:  Microphone went out after about a year.  I've used several different types of headsets  including turtle beaches  and have found these to be preferable in almost every way. The most impacting difference I've found them to have is the fit. It has a pleather-covered cushion on its bridge  and its shape makes it fit a wide range of head sizes and shapes. Other headsets tend to be uncomfortable  or even painful  after long periods of use. This headset fulfills its duty as a gaming headset to be comfortable for lengthy gaming sessions. What many people over-look  since it doesn't affect them much personally  is the out-going audio quality (the microphone). I've found the microphone to have transmit clearer  fuller audio than equally-priced turtle beaches. They have a pretty standard volume-control and on/off switch for the mic. The sound quality is comparable to other similarly priced headsets  as is the sound-blocking capabilities. However  they lack a feature that many other sound-resistant headphones include. Most high-quality headphones will transmit your voice back through your headphone speakers instantly. If they didn't do this  your voice would sound muffled when you spoke  and may cause you to unwittingly speak louder than you need to  which is what you end up experiencing with these headphones. 4/5,0
not fit me at the arms,It is very small at the top. I noticed because I have big arms and wide chest that this is extremely small at the top  the dress in general fit very well but it literally was very tight on the arms and at the top in general and I ordered the XL I'm not even that big on that matter so I'd say if you are on the bigger sized chest or similar this dress will not fit. It did not fit me at the arms and that only happens when it's made too small there for me anyway because I don't even have a lot of boobs so that leads me to believe it would definitely not fit someone with a bigger chest either.,0

helps evenly distribute fat deposits,"Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower did not lather up at all.. I saw a commercial for this Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower. I loved the way it lathered up on the commercial. It did not do this for me. I tried both sides. I tried more body wash. I tried rubbing the back scrubber against itself to create the lather. Nothing worked.  I loved the feel of the little scrubbers and it may very well be a good exfoliator but that is about all it would be good for. The description for this scrubber said  ""Improves vascular blood circulation  helps evenly distribute fat deposits  and release metabolic waste of your skin at the same time"". I can't see that this will be effective.  I will not be recommending this Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower to friends and family. I will be letting them know that the commercial shows a lot of lather but it did not produce that for me.",0

cleverly crafted story arcs and meaningful character interaction,"Vicki Nelson's new partner really sucks...literally.. Blood Ties revolves around Victoria ""Vicki"" Nelson  an ex-cop with Toronto's Metro police. Vicki was forced to resign due to a degenerative eye disease  retinitis pigmentosa  and is trying to make a living as a private investigator. Her fiery romance with fellow cop Mike Celluci is an on-again  off-again affair  and her first case as a PI gives her more than she bargained for: someone is summoning demonic forces  and Henry Fitzroy  her new partner on the case  just happens to be a 480-year-old vampire and is the illegitimate son of Henry VIII.  The series pilot Blood Price is faithfully based on Tanya Huff's [[ASIN:0756405017 Blood Price (BLOOD SERIES)]]. The remainder of the season finds Vicki exploring demons  incubi  reanimated corpses  shapeshifters  mummies  voodoo  ghosts...while caught in a crackling love triangle between former flame Mike and sensual  deadly Henry. Vicki's new assistant is the perky Goth Coreen  who also has her eye on Henry.  Blood Ties consistently satisfies my cravings for an intelligently handled supernatural cop drama. Its premise sounds promising in print  but without Blood Ties' cleverly crafted story arcs and meaningful character interaction  it would amount to little more than a tired monster-movie-of-the-week retread. This is a show that wisely knows not to take itself too seriously  leading to fast and furious one-liners  visual gags and impeccable comedic timing. The entire Canadian cast and crew does a consistently amazing job of bringing Blood Ties to life  and it's great to see a Canadian production receive airtime in the States.  The show's setting is Toronto but is filmed in Vancouver (with exterior shots of identifying Toronto landmarks)  but it's still Canadian through-and-through  a rarity in days where tired Toronto is expected to double as Everyamericancity. This may be the first show since [[ASIN:B0000C23T1 Forever Knight - The Trilogy  Part 1 (1992 - 1993)]] that revels in its Canadianness.  Although Blood Ties is currently off-air  its fan base continues to spread through word of mouth  Big Fish's Blood Ties game  and Internet groups  thereby bringing new viewers into the fold. It has been at least a decade since I felt so strongly about a TV show I was so moved by Blood Ties' strong female role model and intriguing blend of romance  police procedural  and the supernatural that I downloaded several episodes via iTunes and recruited several friends to the show.  Blood Ties remains my current favorite for its enchanting blend of humor  passion  action  moral dilemmas  and the mortal (and immortal) ties that bind. Tanya Huff's source material has been toned down enough to allow families to enjoy Blood Ties together. Blood Ties protagonist Vicki Nelson (Christina Cox) is a strong positive role model for women through her physicality  self-reliance despite disability  and intelligence.  It's instantly obvious (except to American/Canadian networks who are reluctant to pick up the show for a second season  grrr...) why Blood Ties continues to be nominated for numerous awards such as Constellation and Leo Awards. The entire cast  headed by Christina Cox (Vicki)  Kyle Schmid (Henry)  Dylan Neal (Mike)  and Gina Holden (Coreen)  has an outstanding chemistry that shines on-screen  and I can't wait to finally own Blood Ties on DVD!",1
metal trays are really thin,wooden bird play tray. Comes completely flat. All pieces are wood.  There are two tiny metal cups for food and water.  There is a bag of screws and allen/phillips end screwdriver.  It was relatively easy to put together.  HOWEVER there are NO directions at all.  Zero Zip Nadda.  You get to come back to the ad page and TRY to follow the tiny printed direction (even after enlarging by hovering over the diagram).  The pieces you are working with are NOT marked even though the diagram suggests they may be.  Is really just an ok set - but I am still really disappointed that they could not manage to provide truly adequate instructions WITH the set.  The metal tray is REALLY thin... just the other side of aluminum foil - seriously.  And it arrived dented in multiple places.  Eh.,0
tooth fell out,turned out AOK after all. my cats sniffed them but didnt chew them ....  i unfortunately cant eat them to give a good review  LOL  I guess they will play with them  or ill throw them outside maybe the possums will eat them  UPDATE one of my cats chews them but she's young the older cat  chewed on one and a tooth fell out  LOL i sent a pack to my friend who has a LOT of cats and they are happy,0
safe and organized,kershaw knife storage bag. Husband has a huge collection of Kershaws and he LOVES this bag.  Great to keep your knives safe and organized.  Only thing is.. we are gonna have order another he has so many.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
value,WHAT THEY EAT OUTSIDE THE USA. Interesting to try their snacks but certainly nothing to write home about.  If price cut in half the value would get one more star.  If you do not mind spending the bucks and wonder what people in other countries eat then go for it.  Looking for great treats inexpensively - skip this.  I suspect sooner or later one country will come up with something that your taste buds will fall in love with but otherwise just enjoy the experience and don't have too many expectations.,1
cradle fairly well,large dial corded phone. purchased for use when the power goes out... giant number/buttons... NOT back lit... but super easy to see.  Speaker phone works  handy when you need to keep your hands free.  3 giant boxes for pictures of persons you want to speed dial... I don't use that part... but this phone was designed for an older person I think.  :)  A considerable amount of control options... med  high or very high handset volume... ringer hi/lo or off... and a slide control of the speaker volume...  It has a redial button.  A speaker button.  And a flash button.  It has a red corner on the top left that indicates the ring - so when you have the ring off (and when it is on) that light flashes.  There is a dedicated 911 button that is red. The handset sets in the cradle fairly well at the top... the bottom a bit less... and the bottom is what matters.  If the bottom is off the cradle  the phone registers off the hook. I use it sitting on a corner stand... it does have a hole you could hand on the wall.  It is bright white.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. I hope that the time I took to write this detailed review is helpful to you in some way!,0
the adjunct to my selections of books to read,"Ahhhh ... my favorite magazine. I'm not an archaeologist. If I was born redundantly wealthy I think that I might have been one.  Archaeology is my ""stop everything and read it on the day it arrives"" magazine. I've been a subscriber for years. I read EVERY article. As a reader of archaeology and paleontology tomes  this magazine is the adjunct to my selections of books to read. My wife and I have planned vacations around Archaeology's articles.  I've detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites.  During a cross country moving event 7 years ago  I let the subscription expire for lack of new address. Someone from Archaeology  not a telemarketer for sure  called me and said that I had been such a long term customer that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew ... was it something about the magazine quality? The voice on the other end was just so dang disappointed as she pleaded for feedback that it was stunning enough for me to remember 7 years later. The magazine must be read by a small but dedicated subscriber base and I think the magazine staff themselves makes the calls.  My only complaint is that it only prints every 2 months. If archaeology is among your interests  you would entertain your fancies with a subscription.",1
evening,It is worthless for Tv times and listings.. There is no Tv listings  times during the day  only for the evening  and it ends at 10:30 pm.  The whole first half of the mag. Is mostly ads.  I  hate it and won't waste my money.  It is definately not user friendly!,0

phone feels protected,10/10 recommend. Love how great these work and my phone always feels so protected! Great buy especially for the price!,1
design is too busy,Nice sturdy table. This is the 3rd table I have purchased  each is in a different place and different purpose.  Sturdy.  I love everything about it except the design  it's too busy.  I would prefer some thing more muted in tone so I didn't have to throw a table cloth over it.  It especially plays tricks with my dad's eye sight  makes him dizzy as one of the reasons it needs be covered.  Good table though.,0
reveal entire puzzle only filled in one word,"Decent  But Expensive Not Fully Functional on New Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" Tablet. CROSSWORDS by Standalone is a decent crossword puzzle app  but inflexible and expensive.  On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet  the working display shows about two-thirds of a weekday NY Times puzzle grid  and I can't find any way to resize the grid to show the whole puzzle at once. (You must swipe down or hit an arrow button to reveal the lower one-third of the grid.)  The Across and Down clues appear alongside the grid in a readable typeface  but the clues are cut off at the right.  (Perhaps this is an 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD issue that the developer will correct fortunately  clicking on a cut-off clue will display the full clue below the grid.)  The puzzle hints--found under the list icon beside the app icon  at the left--don't always work as expected.  For example  ""reveal entire puzzle"" only filled in one word (for the 1-down clue) when I started from the ""hints for 1-down"" screen.  In contrast  ""reveal entire puzzle"" filled in the entire puzzle when I started from a ""press-and-hold-on-clue"" popup.  Worse  the general settings for navigation (e.g.  ""skip filled squares""  ""show mistakes"") don't seem to function at all.  (Perhaps this is another Kindle Fire HD issue for the developer to fix.)  The app allows you to enter multiple letters in a single square  and to look up puzzle info (must-haves for NY Times crossword solvers).  If you are a NY Times crosswords subscriber  the app will automatically download the daily puzzles for you.  The app comes with an assortment of puzzles already installed  and allows you to browse for and download many more puzzles from the Internet.  It also allows you to establish an account and compare your times with other solvers.  However  the FREE [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] app does nearly all of the same things.  (Crosswords Plus does not download your NY Times subscription puzzles automatically  although it makes it easy to download them daily it doesn't come with puzzles loaded  although it points you to free Internet sources and it doesn't have a feature for comparing scores with other solvers.)  In addition  [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] allows you to resize the grid  offers an alternate clues-only view  includes the usual hints options  and has navigational settings (skipping boxes  etc.) that are fully functional on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet.  Even if this CROSSWORDS app worked perfectly  I would still prefer [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]].  For this reason  and because of the high price and current Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet issues  I rate CROSSWORDS at 3 stars.",0
buy the right S pen,It does hold the S pen. If the case was just to hold the S pen this case would get 5 stars but in protection for the phone forget that. No shock walls the case is way too flimsy. And make sure you buy the right S pen. You need the pen made the S21 ultra. I wanted to like the case. The case I have used most is the Speck Presidio 2 Grip.,0

table clamp is easy to attach,"goose neck cell phone/device holder. I was really hoping to love love this... and I do like it.. PROS - Like having a third arm/hand - holds in place you choose - black or white color options  (I purchased black for husband and white for me) - table clamp is easy to attach if you have a perfectly flat table (top and bottom) up to 2"" thick or so - using twisting tube attached to the base. -NOTE:  There is a ""con"" to this as well. - The coil is very  very difficult to manipulate.  BUT it once you get it there  it stays exactly where you place it. CONS - the clamp is really really stiff and difficult to stretch enough to hold your phone or device.  If you have any strength issues  this might not be the best choice.  Also  they edges will pinch you if you accidentally get your fingers in the way of the spring loaded clips. - The table clamp only works with tables that are flat on top and bottom.  The place I wanted to clamp on has a groove underneath and my husband had to make a wooden block of sorts for the table clamp to work.  Overall  I like the stand - but the engineering that is required to make a strong  stable holder  also makes it difficult to use.  Just sayin.",0
too small for any real purpose,Don't Waste Your Time Or Money. It's rinky dink  as in too small for any real purpose. I'd gotten this thinking it would keep the headphones attached to me  and that's not happening. It doesn't grip the cable securely at all (rather flimsy). And therefore it is of no use to me  and I plan on sending it back and getting a refund.,0
larger cup size,"Ring the Alarm!!!. Someone should call the cops because looking this good should be a crime. This jumpsuit is oh-so-glam! I honestly can't believe how great it looks for the price. The fabric is a lightweight chiffon-like fabric with a hint of stretch. As a woman with rippled thighs  I was concerned about the combination of a light color and a thin fabric. No worries!! There's no show-through even though the pants are unlined. If you're a larger cup size  you'll probably need to wear a tube top or bandeau under this for more coverage. I'm not judging if you want to show off your goodies. The belt is long enough to wrap around twice. I did this for extra cinching. The color I chose is more of a sage green than a true mint. Pay close attention to the size chart. I found it to be very accurate. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the X-Large.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",0
clips will break easily,Very nice clip & hair tie set but clips will break easily one broke immediately out of the package. This is a very nice set of 6 clips  10 hair ties  and a case. I particularly love the blue clips. Unfortunately  the first blue one I tried broke immediately as can be seen in the photo. At least I have one blue left. The clips are strong and do  hold a generous amount of hair. I like the non-slippery feeling of the clip itself. The ties are ordinary but still functional.  The current price of $7.99 is reasonable for this set but just be aware that the clips will break easily because the plastic is not that strong. I'm definitely annoyed about the one clip that broke.,0
strong scented peppermint oil,Pepperment oil  great for diffusers  use sparingly. Strong scented peppermint oil. With this a little goes a long way. I use this in my diffuser and it adds a minty fresh scent to my guest bathroom. I am not 100% thrilled with the peppermint aroma  a little strong for me (i prefer it a little lighter) so just be sure that  especially when using it in small spaces  to use sparingly. Price is wonderful for this product as well.,1
spiritual and cultural mysticism,Too religious. I wanted to enjoy literary essays  stories  and articles  but it seems like every issue I received this last year is packed full of a religious agenda of one variety or another.  To be sure  the themes seem to be an eclectic variety of spiritual and cultural mysticism  but the magazine never just leaves it out.  It's always a tome espousing some collection of beliefs  cultural systems  and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence using religious narratives  symbols  and sacred histories or allusions from one or another.  Everytime I read it  I feel like I'm being proselytized.,0
power outages intermittently occur,Great way to provide additional charging capabilities to your devices!. I was excited to get this powerbank for multiple reasons. First  I live in Florida where power outages intermittently occur but especially during hurricanes. Second  I travel a lot and love to take videos and photos with my iPhone XR. This powerbank helps me with both purposes. I recently went on a cruise to the Caribbean where I was off the ship many times without access to power. I kept this device in my purse and as soon as I could see the power getting critically low  I was easily able to recharge my phone and continue with my explorations. I have not experienced any hurricanes yet since I have owned this but  as we are in August and quickly approaching the highest part of hurricane season  I am thrilled to know that if I was to lose power I have at least a way to continue to keep in touch with friends and relatives!,0
guitar solos are weak,Best Def Leppard cd in 16 years.. Upon first listen I'm pretty underwhelmed by the guitar solos.  Some of these songs really could of used a Killer solo but ended up with instantly forgettable barely existent weak solos instead.  The songs on the other hand are much better.  Early faves are Dangerous  Sea of Love and All Time High (nice solo). It's their best cd since Euphoria   but it's not as good as Euphoria(IMO Euphoria is around 5th or 6th best Leppard cd). Definitely better than sparkle. I give it 4 /5 stars. Let's Go is good too but borrows too heavily from Sugar.,0

discarded the entire thing and bought a replacement from Lowe’s.,Poor quality. Arrived timely packaged minimally and professionally. After install product leaked considerably. Further eval revealed a poorly finished lid that was rough and burred  this caused the seal around the O-ring to fail.  I discarded the entire thing and bought a replacement from Lowe’s.,0
Ink lasts 3X as long as Lexmark,Canon MP480 all in one. I owned Lexmark Pinter about 4 of them and 3 HP. I like this one the best  even it was less expensive than my other printer. Reason: I never had a printer in which the Ink lasted 3X as long as Lexmark  the other printer nickel and dimes you to dead over the ink to expensive and does not last.  Cannon ist excellent,1
orange oil,Softest hands ever  lightly scented w/ lemongrass oil  lemon oil  orange oil  rosemary. I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!)  and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft  smooth  clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F)  dry day. Super moisturizing.  Oddly  I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps  and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches  nausea)  but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners)  I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass  but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil  orange oil  and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean  but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.  I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent  and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich  super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did  I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here  lol. I kinda want it as a body wash. My hands feel SO GOOD after using this. I just keep touching my hands.  One does not need a lot of soap  so feel free to just add a little to the hand. I would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down. Or if you like this soap and have a foamer  then just a wee bit of this with a lot of water will do it.  Love their designs on the bottles.  Water  Organic Coconut Oil  Organic Olive Oil  Vegetable Glycerin  Organic Guar Gum  Lemongrass Oil  Orange Oil  Organic Jojoba Oil  Lemon Oil  Rosemary Extract  Organic Aloe Vera (Potassium Hydroxide is used to saponify the organic oils into soap  but none remains in the final product),1
"narrower mass appeal than ""Farm Chicks in the Kitchen""","Retro-inspired country Christmas is a walk down memory lane.... ""The Farm Chicks Christmas"" by Serena Thompson is the follow-up to 2009's [[ASIN:1588168662 The Farm Chicks in the Kitchen: Live Well  Laugh Often  Cook Much]]. The first Farm Chicks book was a countrified cookbook peppered liberally with stories and reminiscences by Serena and Teri  antiques-inspired craft ideas (a reusable stencil was included in the front)  and comfort food: easy recipes for breakfast treats  appetizers  soups and salads  and decadent desserts  over fifty in all.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas "" on the other hand  is written only by Serena  a contributing editor for Country Living magazine and antiques show hostess (her best friend Teri has retired from their business). The book still includes numerous country-inspired craft ideas you'll find decorative  retro-inspired self-adhesive gift tags and notecards at the back  along with various decorating ideas for ""the most wonderful time of the year."" However  the ratio of crafts to recipes is reversed from the first book there are only 17 recipes included at the back with gift-giving suggestions on how to package them.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" captures the magic of childhood Christmases  from family visits to the tree farm (complete with recipe ideas for hot drinks to tote along)  holiday decorating ideas (holiday scalloped bunting  vintage-inspired snowball pompom ornaments  cone trees and vintage funnel trees  banners and more)  and photos of Serena's friends' and family's homes decorated for Christmas.  Much of the book is more like a scrapbooked photo essay  with crafts sprinkled in every few pages. Also  the decorating tips (and included photos) are vintage country in the Farm Chicks fashion: displaying old farm toys standing in coconut snow  for example  or stacking metal funnels to make ""trees."" If you're not a fan of all things country  this probably isn't the holiday book for you.  The included holiday recipes are few  and aimed mostly at gift-giving  like the sweet and salty nuts  mini orange bundt cakes  and various types of cookies (butter cutouts  chocolate-covered peanut butter balls  snowballs  Spritz cookies). As with the previous book  a handy list of metric equivalent charts is provided at the back. I tried the sweet and salty nuts recipe first  and though tasty  I didn't think that the ""sweet"" flavor predominated it was more of a subtle afterthought (there's only 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of honey for 3 cups of nuts).  Overall  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" is a nostalgic walk down a snowy memory lane  but it has narrower mass appeal than ""Farm Chicks in the Kitchen"" due to the reversal of the recipe-to-crafts ratio and the genre-specific decorating style (I enjoyed the many beautiful photographs  but won't find myself making yarn-ball wreaths or filling jars with spare Christmas lightbulbs anytime soon).

useful in very light weight use,mini carabiners. These are super light duty carabiners... useful in very light weight use. .. A couple of keys... or a clip to clip onto something stronger... Just know they are NOT heavy duty.  You get a bunch of them - 30.  So you'll have a LOT of lightweight  small carabiners!  They are mainly black with a small amount of silver at the clip.,0
good job with my hair,Nice set. This came with a lot. It is good to use the different brushes/combs for different times.  They did a good job with my hair. It worked as it was supposed to. It seemed like it was good quality. My hair came out looking nice after I used it. It also seemed durable. It was easy to hold and handle. I was pleased and would recommend it.,1
new packaging is fantastic,Great gum  texture and flavor are fantastic and long lasting! And good for the environment as well!. Need to start by saying I love Extra gums. Used to be an exclusive Trident user  but I found that Extra gum tends to last longer and the flavor is as great an hour from now as it was when you first popped it in your mouth. This new packaging is fantastic. First it's 'green' and made of recyclable plastic which I love and it's a huge 35 count pack. This is perfect for storing in my purse and especially will be great when I travel to Europe next month. The spearmint flavor is wonderful and like I said  extra long lasting. I prefer this new packaging style and make better than anything I have seen on the market. I will be picking up more at my local Publix this weekend (if they have them). Just wonderful!,1
keeping my eyes on the Circuit City sales flier in the paper and buy from them,Only worth it if on sale. Like others said  this stuff pack is the Holiday pack from last year plus 20 more items. There are some lovely items but EA still doesn't seem to realize that they are shooting themselves in the foot by offering the stuff packs at $19.99. Lowering the price here to $14.99 is a bit better but not by much.  The only reason why I bought this stuff pack was because Circuit City had it on sale for $9.99 between November 19-22. If I'd been paying attention over the summer I would have bought Family Fun & Glamour at Circuit City at those prices but I missed the sales. $10-12 I think is a fair price for the amount of stuff in the pack. If EA set the price to that I believe the stuff packs would literally fly off the shelves. Every time one of these new packs come out I will be keeping my eyes on the Circuit City sales flier in the paper and buy from them.,1
air started seeping out,This is horrible. 0 stars if I could give 0. It was hard to fill with air  no matter how much we flopped it around.  We finally used a heavy duty blower to fill it up.  After filling it up  we laid on it and the air started seeping right out.  Couldn't lay on it for more than 5 minutes.  I do not recommend.,0
in good condition,work well. my husband prefers these &#34sock&#34 covers as opposed to the styrofoam cup style.  He thinks they stay on and protect better.  They arrived quickly  despite noting addtional days for arrival and in good condition.,1
quality,Amazing comfort. Quality built product with excellent comfort. It’s very important for a headset  especially a gaming headset to fit comfortably. The last thing anyone wants is an excellent sounding headset that doesn’t fit comfortablely. The sound is good with these at the cost. Still in the value gaming headset range. Noise canceling is good and mic is on par with most gaming headsets. The biggest pro for me is the comfort. For adult sized heads but might fit younger heads as well. Over all very pleased. Mainly used to play Fortnite and other Xbox games.,1
figure out the straps,A must-have for your earthquake kit!. These are great! I bought them for our earthquake kits and will buy more! In case there's a big one and aftershocks  have this handy in case of more falling objects. Great price as well. Took a few minutes to figure out the straps to put them together- then it was a breeze-  very happy with this purchase.,0
Sri Lankan heritage,Sugar and spice and everything nice!. Samantha Seneviratne’s “The New Sugar and Spice” takes classic comfort bakes like cinnamon rolls  cookies  breads and cheesecake and reinvents them  using seductive hits of spice in creative and crowd-pleasing ways. In the introduction  the author points out that “the flood of sugar has diluted real flavor  muffled complexity  and concealed true richness ” so her goal was to create delicious  healthier desserts that use spices in a starring role in place of the overwhelming sweetness so prevalent in many desserts.  Chapters are divided by spices (sometimes with complementary pairings)  including peppercorn and chile  cinnamon  nutmeg  clove and cardamom  ginger  and savory herbs and spices. Along the way  Samantha includes stories about her family’s roots and how her Sri Lankan heritage influenced her culinary style  along with fascinating historical insights and storage tips on the various featured spices.  Cinnamon  hazelnut and date buns  ricotta cheesecake with bourbon-raisin jam  orange and honey baklava  orange-clove pull-apart bread  and saffron currant braid were all recipes that instantly called my name. Several years ago  I became hooked on Scandinavian baking and now tend to use cardamom liberally in yeast rolls and sweet breads (even in my morning coffee)  so naturally I was thrilled to see a whole chapter starring my favorite spice!  Measurements are given in both volume and weight (which I appreciate as I find weight measurements to be more reliable). Samantha’s guidance is spot-on there are helpful hints both for new bakers as well as experienced ones to guarantee the best results  particularly for recipes involving yeast. Gorgeous photography by Erin Kunkel highlights various ingredients and finished bakes for maximum (mouth-watering!) impact.  In addition to familiar treats  you’ll find updated versions of international classics such as profiteroles  clafoutis and tarte tatin  Scandinavian bakes like saffron currant braids and cardamom-laced shortbread  Thai banana fritters  Indonesian kue lapis  Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars that are perfect for fall  and other fragrant  delightful baked goods that spiced up my rather predictable baking repertoire. As an experienced home baker  I appreciated the challenge and loved the complexity that the various spices gave to my baked goods and will certainly be baking my way through “The New Sugar and Spice in the near future!  (I received my copy through Blogging for Books),1
birds love it,Beautiful colors. I Can't have enough bird feeders. This 1 is very nice With a good weight so it doesn't blow around on a windy day.All the birds love it.,1
more thorough,flex edge beater kitchenaid. Love love love this beater.  I have a 4.5 quart tilt head kitchenaid  model KSM85PBSM.  Fit and worked perfectly through the holiday cookie season. It really helped make the mixing easier  more thorough.  Easy to clean.  If you own a kitchenaid  you need this beater!  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
"""pulled my hair""",Chums original. Work exactly as they should.  I put them on a pair of Oakly's that had rubber temples and pulled my hair ALLLLL the time.  Sliding these on clipping off the ends of the chums  (I know.. not exactly the right application - but what the heck).  NO more hair pulling.  Love it.,0
Nice design,Nice value gaming headset.. Pros: Fit will over my ears. Good clean sound. Mic works well and does not pick up background noise. Nice design  they remind me flying headphones. Comes with volume and mute controls. Comes with audio adapters for PC or mobile device.  Cons: Only con so far is I wish the mute and volume were on the cable instead the headset.,1
tank is too small,Tank is too small for glasses.. The tank barely holds dentures.,0
articles,Good Magazine. interesting articles and ideas. Easy read for the novice to the expert.,1
sparkle,Beautiful & Good Quality. I just received this nose ring.  It is very pretty and of good quality.  The heart is a nice size and has a little sparkle to it.  I gave only four stars because of the fit.  It'd be nice if it was a tad bit longer.  I wish nose stud makers would offer a variety of lengths for those of us with slightly larger noses who do not wish to bother with altering fishtails.,1
Suggestible You,Amazing read.. Amazing read...confirmed my personal beliefs that we are already living on paradise here on earth  and it will be up to man kind to figure how to love one another in order to maintain this precious ecosystem and continue to flourish and develop as a people.  I was a bit disappointed that Bruce did not share a bit more about his personal transformation  but overall an easy read for the non-scientific minded like me!  Also I just picked up Suggestible You  by Erik Vance which was mentioned in Bruce Lipton's book and this is starting out as an amazing read as well.  If anyone has other suggested reading  please pass them along,1
trails in different states,Still not very good. I had a subscription to this magazine a few years ago. I let my sub run out because the magazine was not that good. I decided to give it another try and see if this magazine had improved. Nope  still the same old magazine. The gear reviews always seem to review the high end gear that only a small percentage of people can afford.   The articles are usually about hiking trails that are the top tier trails. PCT  AT  CDT  etc. How about some trails that are in different states that do not take MONTHS to finish! Some nice weekend trails would be awesome!! Seems like this magazine has always been biased towards the west coast. You know  there are many  many other trails in the US  across all 50 States!! Not just CA!  So  looks like this sub will be just like the first time I subbed. Going to let it expire. I can find better content on youtube anyways!,1
pricey,Bit pricey   but my cats love them.. My cats love these. Dont order in summer or when too hot as they will melt. A bit pricey  but my fur babies are worth the treat.,0
iPad,Used for my iPhone and iPad too !!!. It not bad,1
a bit thin,Decent. These face masks are a decent quality. They're a bit thin  but adequate. They are average sized. My son is a large guy and he found it to be a little small on his face. It covered his mouth and nose  but barely. He also felt that the ear straps were being stretched to the max on his face.  Their designs and colors are really nice.,0
not getting into the rest,I really like the opening riff. The first 2 songs are decent but Im having trouble getting into the rest. I love Reb Beach in Winger but not so much in Dokken.,0
not really a polka dot fan,Would buy again. Finally a large bag that holds everything! With my first I got a cute backpack diaper bag which was great but when another baby came along there was NOT room! Looked around a while and found this. Wish they had more designs because I’m not really a polka dot fan but whatever  it definitely gets the job done. Multiple ways to carry and easy for husband to wear too. He’s a big dude and can fit this on easily. So many pockets and love the fold out diaper change part which has saved us in some questionable changing areas.,0
addition to puzzles,Animal Crossing Vibe. This cat island puzzle has an Animal Crossing vibe to it. The image is fun and colorful  plus it has lots of cats! The pieces are a good size and cut well. I didn't notice any puzzle dust. I did not care for the company logo being on the back of every piece. That actually made it a little more difficult to sort because you had to look at both sides to make sure you were putting the right side up. It doesn't come with a poster of the image either. I really appreciate that addition to puzzles. It's a pain to have to hold the box in your hand just so you can see where things go. The full image is on the bottom of the box. The lid has a blown up picture that doesn't show everything. Plus  the brand logo is on both of the images. They really are pushing their logo on us!! They do include a business card size picture of the puzzle but that's really impossible to use because it's so small.,0
moisturizing,Fantastic!. I bought this for a great nice for a gift and she loved it. Smell fantastic as well as moisturizing? Great price!,1
larger purse would just overwhelm the very small pocket area,handbag car net. I am on the fence on this.  I do like the IDEA of it.  It just doesn't look very good.  I didn't have any trouble at all installing it.  Normally I just set my purse and/or other items on the passenger seat.  But when I have a passenger  it's difficult to figure out how to put my purse somewhere - I have a very small purse  so this mesh net does hold small purse.  If you have a medium or large purse  I really don't think it will work for you.  The front of the mesh netting sort of folds down so you need to reach back and open it to put your small purse in.  A larger one would just overwhelm the very small pocket area - meaning  your purse will likely fall out toward the front of the keeper area.  I am just not sure I will keep it.  There are other small pockets in the back of the keeper that are NOT convenient to reach from the driver seat  but could be used by people seated in the backseat - which is very rare for me.  I have a 2021 Lexus 450h.  Honestly  as I said before  I am not sure I'll keep it.  Having said all of that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,0
immediately see whether coding is working,Our 5th Grader Loves It...more than Scratch 2.0!. Our son just received his first installment of Bitsbox  and got started right away. He was thrilled that he could see immediately whether his coding was working or not. As well  the program gives feedback every time he tries to run a script-- if there's a mistake  it lets him know the approximate line that has the mistake. It will really help our son slow down to make sure details are exact-- a great skill for test taking in the classroom. Sharing his app with others is also very easy  and he got such joy out of seeing people react with excitement and fun when trying to play the game he coded. The Bitsbox program allows him to be successful enough to build his confidence to explore writing script on his own  which is something he seemed much more hesitant to do with Scratch 2.0. I think the biggest difference between the two is that Bitsbox makes it so easy to find mistakes every few lines. Plus  I think the layout is more attractive  as Bitsbox literally looks like an app on a smartphone or tablet. So  he gets that sense that he's doing what professional coders do. Way to go Bitsbox!,1
trustworthy reviewer,sparkle lens covers with 'crystals' on rim. Samsung watch 4  40mm  frame covers.  I love sparkle  however  these are really rough and snag things - thus I removed it and tossed.  I wish the 'sparkle' crystal edge had been better polished and/or set in so they would not be so scratchy.  Eh.   Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes. Bottom line  I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,1

softest skin,Softest skin I have had in years!. I have been using Pre de Provence soaps for years now. When I saw this one which includes shea butter  I couldn't wait to try it. After using this exclusively for almost a month  my skin feels  and looks  incredibly soft and smooth. I have terribly dry skin and always use a moisturizer after my shower  but now I have an additional aid to my dry skin in the shower. I love the fragrance  it is light and not overly strong. Pre de Provence makes quality products and I highly recommend them to everyone.,1
convenient,convenient and a safer way to shop Amazon!. Very easy to use and convenient. Assures my banking information wont get in the wrong hands!,1
barely any scent,Softest hands ever  lightly scented w/ lemongrass oil  lemon oil  orange oil  rosemary. I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!)  and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft  smooth  clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F)  dry day. Super moisturizing.  Oddly  I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps  and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches  nausea)  but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners)  I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass  but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil  orange oil  and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean  but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.  I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent  and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich  super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did  I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here  lol. I kinda want it as a body wash. My hands feel SO GOOD after using this. I just keep touching my hands.  One does not need a lot of soap  so feel free to just add a little to the hand. I would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down. Or if you like this soap and have a foamer  then just a wee bit of this with a lot of water will do it.  Love their designs on the bottles.  Water  Organic Coconut Oil  Organic Olive Oil  Vegetable Glycerin  Organic Guar Gum  Lemongrass Oil  Orange Oil  Organic Jojoba Oil  Lemon Oil  Rosemary Extract  Organic Aloe Vera (Potassium Hydroxide is used to saponify the organic oils into soap  but none remains in the final product),0
easy installation,Very strong material.. Easy installation for a Huyndai Tucson 2017.,1
blow up is hard,Hard to blow up! Very light weight.. This baby tub folds in half  which it then does not take up much space. it has to snap open  easy to do. Then unfold the legs down..Easy..  Then you have to blow up the plastic liner underneath. There are two plastic holes to blow up on each side. It was like blowing up a beach ball which is easy   but this is much harder.. Not only harder to blow  which I could not do  but if you can blow this up  you then have to put the rubber stoppers to close it FAST or any air that you could blow in it  will leak out fast. This also has a plastic smell to it  which I think after awhile will dissipate  I hope!  I could not for the life of me get any air into this thing. Maybe I did something wrong!  The plastic liner is thin  and I think it could leak after a while.  Before putting a baby On the plastic liner  you have to put down a baby towel so it is soft for the baby to lay on to.  So far I should have given this a 1 star. But it looks cute  and the colors are nice! I have not given my Hubby a chance to blow this up yet. If he can figure this out with success  I'll be back with a new review.,0
Sturdy,Sturdy. I always loved the game of monopoly I knew I would like this Puzzle. For me it was a bit of a challenge... But I did finish it. It was fun . The pc are easy to hold and the puzzle stays together well.,1
biased towards the west coast,Still not very good. I had a subscription to this magazine a few years ago. I let my sub run out because the magazine was not that good. I decided to give it another try and see if this magazine had improved. Nope  still the same old magazine. The gear reviews always seem to review the high end gear that only a small percentage of people can afford.   The articles are usually about hiking trails that are the top tier trails. PCT  AT  CDT  etc. How about some trails that are in different states that do not take MONTHS to finish! Some nice weekend trails would be awesome!! Seems like this magazine has always been biased towards the west coast. You know  there are many  many other trails in the US  across all 50 States!! Not just CA!  So  looks like this sub will be just like the first time I subbed. Going to let it expire. I can find better content on youtube anyways!,0
loves to cook,I'm sure he will love. I have had a subscription  but I cancelled it because I have too many mags. coming.  However  I found and old on  so I decided to subscribe again.  But this is a gift for my nephew  who loves  to cook.  I'm sure he will love it,1
lasted a couple of months of user time,Love the product but it hasn’t worked long for me.....twice. I am bummed to be only able to give this 2 stars because I love the product and the fact that you have 2 batteries. However  I bought one and it only lasted a couple of months of user time before it wouldn’t work and just make a loud screeching sound in my ear. I decided to order another one hoping it was just a fluke (because  as I mentioned  I really like the product) but after another couple of months of use  the batteries won’t charge and I have 2 charging cords. I love the product but am leery of paying another $25 if it’s only going to last a couple of months.  Update: ugh....I decided to order this for a third time and it isn’t even being delivered in time (as it was promised).,0
expensive,Nice moisturizer  but expensive for what you get. For pluses  this is a nice moisturizer  100% vegan and made with all natural ingredients.  I have been using it almost daily after I get out of the shower  particularly on my hands and face and my skin is noticeably softer. For minuses  this is a really small bottle for the $30+ price they are charging. It does come with a pump (which may be over kill considering the size of the bottle.  Scent was ok for me but would have liked it if it was a little lighter (once it is absorbed  though  the fragrance significantly diminishes). Bottom line  I probably won't be buying again due to the cost vs. volume.,0
gluing fabric to fabric,fabric fusion glue. Ok.  This stuff works.  IF you're gluing FABRIC to FABRIC.  Nothing else.  And NO felt.  Another note.  Use gloves or tweezers to apply.  Wash immediately if you get any on your skin.  If you have 2 layers  makes sure to put something plastic between the two layers.  I haven't tried to wash it yet  but I think it's pretty solid.  Having said all of that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,0
help them,this is a fun game  some items are really hard to find. this is a fun game  some items are really hard to find but thats the challenge..lol what I dont like is the rest of it you have to build cities read about the people and help them...I just want to find the items not all the rest..good graphics too.,1
words are mirrored,Not bad. I think the masks work for kids. Covers their mouth and nose. It fit my six year old and two year old. As another reviewer mentioned  the words are mirrored so that is a little weird.,0

purchase of the game included access to all of the songs,Fun. My family has enjoyed Just Dance games over the years. This one is a little different because it requires the use of a cell phone. While I'm not crazy about that  it does seem to work well. The song list is pretty good  though as with most of the Just Dance games  I only knew about half of the songs. To access all of the songs  you do have to subscribe to something. Long gone are the days when the purchase of the game included access to all of the songs.,0
enhancer and as a personal monitor,An excellent personal monitor for vocalists - compares favorably to the Mackie SRM150. I purchased this to augment our guitarist/vocalist's vocals as both an enhancer and as a personal monitor. I am going to directly compare this to a [[ASIN:B003552MFI Mackie SRM150 5.25-Inch Compact Active PA System]] and a [[ASIN:B008O0RKVA TC Helicon Mic Mechanic]]  both of which I also own.  The Mackie is close to the same form factor as this  but lacks the vocal and effects features that this incorporates. Since it's in the same price range it's an apples-to-apples comparison. In fact  I want to disagree with reviews that bemoan that this is cheaply made because for the price it has about the same build quality as the Mackie (and the almost identical Behringer personal monitor). The connectors  buttons and switches are about equal among them all.  This is louder than the Mackie  and with the effects and vocal enhancements is  in my opinion  superior. However  if you already own a Mackie (or the Behringer)  I strongly recommend getting the Mic Mechanic instead because the range of tweaking that device allows is vastly superior to the controls on this VoiceSolo.  Instead of me boring you with opinions and details  I recommend that you check out the VoiceSolo FX150 Video Manual that TC Helicon has posted on YouTube. That  more than the reviews here  is what convinced me to takea chance on this as both a personal monitor and vocal enhancer  and I am glad I did because this is worth every penny in my opinion.,1
fruits,Make showstopping desserts on your countertop with minimal effort!. I’m a fairly recent convert to the slow cooker bandwagon I only purchased my first slow cooker a couple of years ago and started out by baking my way through all the desserts in Michele Scicolone’s excellent “The Mediterranean Slow Cooker ” which introduced me to the joys of making flan  cheesecake  and fruit compote in the slow cooker.  Fast forward several years later and I was looking to expand my slow cooker desserts repertoire  so imagine my delight when I got an e-mail from Lisa Ekus that highlighted “Slow Cooker Desserts” by Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore! Roxanne and Kathy are cookbook authors  food consultants  cooking teachers and food bloggers who have written seven cookbooks and a popular blog  www.pluggedintocooking.com.  As soon as my copy of “Slow Cooker Desserts” arrived  I couldn’t wait to dig in to the many inviting recipes covering not only cakes and cheesecakes  but also bread puddings  fruits  and candy and fondues. The book opens with a good compact guide to slow cookers  bakeware  and ingredients. The layout is uncluttered and straightforward  and each recipe is followed by helpful tips  making it perfect for novice bakers. The gorgeous photography by Jennifer Davick deserves a special mention as well.  The first recipe I tried was the Praline-Pumpkin Cheesecake. I decided to substitute a gingersnap crust for the graham crackers  and it added the perfect touch of spice to complement the spices in the cheesecake filling. Note that you do need to blind bake the gingersnap crust prior to baking in the slow cooker  but this only adds a few minutes to the prep time. Also  perhaps it was the brand of gingersnaps I used  but I would recommend adding a little extra melted butter until the crust comes together – the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter for ½ cup crumbs. One thing I would suggest is to also liberally spray the sides of your springform pan as well – mine is supposedly nonstick  but I followed the recipe (which only specifies to spray the bottom of the pan) and a large portion of my cheesecake edges stuck and broke. I normally do spray the entire pan with Baker’s Joy  but I follow the recipes as written when I am testing for reviews.  The finished cheesecake texture is very fluffy and a bit crumbly  so I did have difficulty cutting it neatly I’m not sure if I may have beat TOO much air into my filling and will beat for less next time. The praline topping (made in the microwave in under three minutes) is destined to become my new secret weapon in the kitchen! This homemade caramel was delicious and deceptively easy and would also make a great addition to ice cream or cakes. All combined (gingersnap crust  spiced pumpkin filling  praline topping)  this is a great fall dessert with minimal effort and also frees up your oven for other baking tasks.  The second recipe I tried was the candied cranberry and crystallized ginger chutney this one called my name because I am a certified fiend when it comes to candied ginger. I had a bag of organic cranberries in the freezer that I was looking to use up  so it worked out perfectly that I already had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry (even the ginger liqueur!). My bag of organic cranberries was slightly smaller than the 16-oz. bag called for in the recipe  so I scaled back on the sugar quite a bit as I was using candied ginger (I used ¾ cup sugar in place of the 1 ¼ in the recipe  and it was plenty sweet for me). It also had the bonus of making my kitchen smell amazing as it cooked! I cooked mine down for a little longer the recipe says that it should be thin  but I like my chutney on the very thick side more like a compote. The recipe calls for between 5 to 7 hours on low and I ended up cooking mine for 3 hours on high due to time. This would be fantastic stirred into yogurt  as an accompaniment to Indian food  or even as a side dish in place of jellied cranberries or cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.  The third recipe was the chocolate cashew clusters. I’d seen slow cooker candy (including nut clusters) pop up in my Facebook feed  but I’d never tried making it before. The recipe uses salted cashews  semisweet and milk chocolate chips  a dark chocolate candy bar  and candy coating to create decadent nut clusters that look like they came from a candy shop. These take about 1 ½ hours on low plus cooling / set time (3 to 5 hours).  Other recipes on my to-make list from “Slow Cooker Desserts” include the cinnamon-calvados applesauce  rice pudding with cherries  and many of the cheesecakes (brownie chunk  German chocolate  ginger-peach  coconut cream) and cakes (cider-glazed apple-walnut cake  Southern sweet potato cake  pineapple butter cake). There is enough variety and possible variations (I need to find a way to make a cookie butter cheesecake!) to keep you happily baking for months to come.

Elvis' personal producer,Elvis Presley's final album release during his lifetime. Seeing Baz Luhrmann's ELVIS brought me back to this one.  Specifically  the use of Unchained Melody (worth the price of the album by itself) and Elvis' performance of it at the end of the film.  This collection pairs From Elvis Presley Boulevard (1976) and Moody Blue (1977) on one disc.  With the exception of a handful of live in-concert tracks  it all adds up to an album filled with songs of loneliness  lost love  and regret.  Three of the studio cuts rock  all in a different vein:  For the Heart has a country-rock bounce  Moody Blue displays a mild disco feel bubbling beneath its pop-rock melody  Way Down harks back to his Burning Love '70s singles heyday.  The rest is made up largely of tears-in-my-beer balladry.  Both of the discs combined here come from the 1976 Graceland sessions and feature a ton of overdubs and sweetening via Felton Jarvis  Elvis' personal producer.  How you feel about that is strictly up to you.  The sweetening was done with the full knowledge and approval of Elvis  so there you are.  The stripped-down versions found on the Way Down in the Jungle Room double-disc Legacy release sound stronger to my ears.  Regardless  the Moody Blue LP was in the charts the day Elvis passed  and it has always held a special place in my heart.  A full five stars for sticking to it and giving his all to the very end.  Highly recommended.,0
live longer,"nice set. id give it 5 stars except i dont like how the phones sit in the chargers  they lean forward instead of backward including the base  i hope these live longer than my last set  i lost display on each of them  by dropping them  people drop things panasonic  you should make them a bit more sturdy and i know they have a ""rugged""  one but 60 for one handset is a bit ridiculous too",0
silicone sock,"chair leg covers. We just installed a bunch of new vinyl flooring where carpet had been. So  instead of the plastic nubs that help you slide on carpet  you need to switch to the felt based tips.  We've been through a whole passel of felt squares - our chairs have 1 1/4"" square legs.  The felts with the stickers just slide off and never stay in place.  I never tried the ""tack"" on or screw on types for fear of harming my floor - and then we found these!  These are a really good design.  They are different than other silicone sleeve with the felt squares only at the bottom... those slip and tear the silicone  eventually coming off.  SO FAR - these have stayed in place perfectly  without slipping.  Key is that the felt square rounds UP the side of silicone sock.  Slides A LOT better across the floor as you're sitting on the chair than any of the other stick on felts.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.  Time will tell if these are as good as they seem to be.  We have four chairs so we used 16 tips and you get 24.  So there are replacements should they become necessary.  I think it's important that they fit snugly on the chair feet so measuring is important.  If you're tired of changing your chair foot felts  I say give this one a try.  They have multiple colors to choose from too.",0
Wyonna,little bit of rock  a little bit of country and a little bit of rap. it is funny  how within one song you can get a real mix of composition!  for a new comer  she has a great voice and like a review before  she definately has a bit of carrie underwood  a bit of pussycat  and a little bit of Wyonna too.  The lyrics are definately more country orientated.  Strong voice  great music beat and many of the songs  I couldnt help tapping my feet and I am going to incorporate many of songs in my personal spinning exercise program.  Definately a good album to play in an open car!,1
awesome,super fun but be VERY CAREFUL>. this is not a toy.  but it is pretty awesome.  I wouldn't let a kid fly this unless he is carefully supervised.  i'm an adult with experience flying rc planes.  i was not comfortable when I turned it on.  it could really hurt someone.  there are a few quirks that don't get explained but there are enough users out there that help.,1
help keeping other birds out,Great Product. Chickens like it  help keeping other birds out!!!!,1
my dog didn't care for them,Quality dog treat  unfortunately my dog didn't care for them.. All in all  this is a good dog treat. With no wheat  soy  corn or preservatives  I would feel confident in feeding them to my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix Roxie. Unfortunately  she didn't like them. Maybe the fact that these are cranberry/oat variety and not something with chicken or beef  turned her away. However  you can't judge the quality of this product by my dog as she has a tendency to be very picky when it comes to any food. I have read other reviews here and I see that most dogs love these  so I am rating them as 4 stars simply based on the quality of the product and its ingredients.,0
temporary improvement,Good night time moisturizer. This is a nice night time skin moisturizer. Thick and creamy  this is meant to be used at night (does not absorb quickly into the skin). I have used Crepe Erase in the past and don't feel that this lives up to its more famous brand  but overall it is a decent moisturize. I have seen a softer improvement in my skin and the crepiness  does seem to be diminished  but I am afraid it is just a temporary improvement (if I stop  I am sure it will quickly return). Overall  it's a nice moisturizer but may be overpriced.,0
new interface sleek and user friendly,Great for new users  lousy for upgraders. In the past I have used several versions of Magix Music Maker  including version 7  2005  and 10. Each has been a steady progression of improvement and capability  so I was quite eager to see how much new stuff was added when I upgraded from version 10 to version 14. I was surprised not so much by the new capabilities but by how much has been removed.  The overall application is similar to Sony Acid or even Audacity - it is a loop-based music composition and production tool. The main production board allows for up to 96 tracks  which is a generous amount and should be plenty for all but the most complex and lengthy of tracks. There are a large number of production tools that allow for all manner of effects and edits  giving a near limitless supply of tweaks and edits that can be made to a track.  The new interface (as compared to version 10 which is my reference point) is sleek and user friendly  although the learning curve for an application of this type is understandably steep. Most functions are relatively straightforward  but some do require a jaunt through the user manual which is included in PDF form in the installation directory.  There is a generous supply of good-quality loops  though users of previous versions have seen some of these in the past. For a new user  though  there's a lot to choose from.  The VSTi interface is vastly improved and updated  making it not only a lot more user friendly but a lot more stable too. A new synth is included  the Vita. This supposedly take place of the guitar and grand piano synths  though I have not worked enough with it to replicate those sounds. I have monkeyed with it enough to make some interesting sounds  though  and overall I think it's a good synth.  Magix has done a nice job of better integrating their tools  which is a step forward. The only problem there is that sometimes users of previous versions may struggle to find some of the tools they want or need. Such is the case with me  though I found most of what I sought. Most - not all. This is where I noticed something unpleasant.  Music Maker 10 came with a wonderful tool called the Music Editor  which is a waveform editor with some other useful functions. I used this more than Music Maker itself. I was anxious to see how it had changed and when I looked for it I could not find it. What I did find  in the help file  was an occasional reference to it including a menu selection for locating it. The selection did not exist. After digging deeper I found that Magix stripped out the Music Editor and it is available as an upgrade to the Producer Edition - which you can ONLY get through the Magix website. Another $30 and you can have what used to be included.  Also gone are the Copper synth and the Silver synth. I used to use the Copper quite frequently and that one will be missed. I do not understand why it was removed  having been in the application for many iterations.  For a new user  Music Maker 14 packs a lot of goodies into the package and is a great starting point. For upgraders  though  it is a disappointment  with the smell of being a play for additional fees (much like activating the MP3 plug-in). This will be my last Magix purchase  based on the change in packaging and pricing  though I like the program itself. Hopefully Magix will realize that alienating long-standing customers is a poor strategy and will include the missing pieces in the regular edition again.,1
contacted seller never responded,Not Happy. this product lasted 3 months and died  i had to buy a new computer  this part was hard to find - contacted seller he/she never responded - dont bother wasting your money  buy a new computer !!,0
rock solid,Heavy  great protection and a solid value. I purchased this to house a Yamaha MG12  which it did perfectly. To be sure  the footprint is pretty large  and it's heavy  but it is also rock solid.  There is ample room between the rear of the case and the MG12 to accommodate the power cable  and I can also place a few spare cables in that area.  The exterior is rugged.  Be aware  though  that with the mixer (the MG12) it is pretty heavy. I have a Rock-N-Roller cart  so hauling it is not a problem as long as stairs are not involved. Can I recommend it?  Yes. Would I still buy it knowing what I now know? Absolutely. Bang for the buck there is nothing close (that I have found  anyway.,1

confusing,Liked it a lot. Samantha  a nurse is kidnapped by an FBI agent on the run with a young boy. She ends up going on the run with them and helps him to discover who wanted them dead. A lot of suspense  a good plot and decently written. A few misspelled words and bouncing between POV's without warning was confusing. Also  too many scenes were neatly explained away and too many simple daily functions were never included which took away the believability of the story. Aside from that I adored the family dynamic and the happily ever after.,0
favorite for years,One of my Favorite!. This CD is part of a series that have been my favorite for years. I am thankful to have it (and the others) on CD again!,1
took a while to get here,ear loop elastic. Have a sister-in-law that is making masks to share and this works wonderfully.  It's lightweight and stretchy.  Works great.  It did take a while to get here in these days.,0
Indonesian kue lapis,Sugar and spice and everything nice!. Samantha Seneviratne’s “The New Sugar and Spice” takes classic comfort bakes like cinnamon rolls  cookies  breads and cheesecake and reinvents them  using seductive hits of spice in creative and crowd-pleasing ways. In the introduction  the author points out that “the flood of sugar has diluted real flavor  muffled complexity  and concealed true richness ” so her goal was to create delicious  healthier desserts that use spices in a starring role in place of the overwhelming sweetness so prevalent in many desserts.  Chapters are divided by spices (sometimes with complementary pairings)  including peppercorn and chile  cinnamon  nutmeg  clove and cardamom  ginger  and savory herbs and spices. Along the way  Samantha includes stories about her family’s roots and how her Sri Lankan heritage influenced her culinary style  along with fascinating historical insights and storage tips on the various featured spices.  Cinnamon  hazelnut and date buns  ricotta cheesecake with bourbon-raisin jam  orange and honey baklava  orange-clove pull-apart bread  and saffron currant braid were all recipes that instantly called my name. Several years ago  I became hooked on Scandinavian baking and now tend to use cardamom liberally in yeast rolls and sweet breads (even in my morning coffee)  so naturally I was thrilled to see a whole chapter starring my favorite spice!  Measurements are given in both volume and weight (which I appreciate as I find weight measurements to be more reliable). Samantha’s guidance is spot-on there are helpful hints both for new bakers as well as experienced ones to guarantee the best results  particularly for recipes involving yeast. Gorgeous photography by Erin Kunkel highlights various ingredients and finished bakes for maximum (mouth-watering!) impact.  In addition to familiar treats  you’ll find updated versions of international classics such as profiteroles  clafoutis and tarte tatin  Scandinavian bakes like saffron currant braids and cardamom-laced shortbread  Thai banana fritters  Indonesian kue lapis  Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars that are perfect for fall  and other fragrant  delightful baked goods that spiced up my rather predictable baking repertoire. As an experienced home baker  I appreciated the challenge and loved the complexity that the various spices gave to my baked goods and will certainly be baking my way through “The New Sugar and Spice in the near future!

position the wheels and legs,5-7 year old set.... We've only received one month's worth so far but will update after this month's set comes. We purchased the 5-7 year old set for our 6 year old's bday. She needed help with it when we first put things together  played with it a while...then decided she wanted to try another one. I helped her put that one together and we talked about how to follow the directions one step at a time  etc  she played with it for a little while. Then  she took it apart on her own  and started building her own creation! She first played with the motorized part and figured out how to position the wheels and legs how she wanted them  and now  she's teaching the 2 year old how to do it! &#603 I love creative toys that teach tinkering and whatnot! I can't wait to get the next set in a few days!,1
tissue holder is really a tosser,"car garbage can and kleenex dispenser. The garbage can is small - but wider than I had hoped.  I had wanted to set this can in the side door slot.. but it's too wide. (2019 Lexus 450hL).  So  the only choice I have is to ""hang"" the garbage can on the drive stick and drape to the passenger side... OR set - loose- on the passenger side floor.  Eh.  It MIGHT be leather - can't really tell.  The tissue holder is really a tosser - I can't use it and the tissue included is really awful quality.  So - I am still looking for what I really want.  This isn't it.",0
sometimes there are more slides,Enjoying this!. We are really enjoying this so far. We've been in the club since Sept 2018 now for our five year old..  We have got  so far  the Cars car you put together (Lightning McQueen) which was a bit hard for him to do - he needed adult help.  The talking microscope is good although unless there are more slides it has a limited span of play.  I did cancel one month because the item had bad reviews  so I didn't want to try it - it was a gardening one.  Then Dec was a National Geographic crystal growing kit - which looks like it will be fun. We haven't done it yet. (Great deal as its normally $40 and we paid stem price of $19.99.)  I like being a part of this as it is always choosing things not on my radar at all - and I appreciate that. I love the whole STEM concept too  being so educational.  We will be continuing and recommend!,0
nasty tasting,As an adult they sucked. No pun intended. Nasty tasting.,0
a little busty,Floral tank dress with pockets. Oh man.. these dresses are the cat's meow.  I bought 2 and came back to order 2 more.  I am 5'7&#34... 38DDD  usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  The XX fits me perfectly. I am a little busty so it's sort of empirish.. but doesn't look maternity.  And the best part?? POCKETS ladies!! Oh yes.  Lovely pockets that don't stick out. Just handy.  I wear them over my swimsuits... I dress them up with jewelry... and/or a jacket.  The prints are vibrant and clear.  The wash beautifully (I wash on delicate and tumble dry on &#34low&#34).  If you try one  you'll come back for more I bet.  This dress would fit a wide range of body types in my opinion. Further  as I travel a fair amount  they pack so nicely  without wrinkles!  Love love love. And I rarely get to say that about clothes of any kind. UPDATE:  10/3 ...  I've gone back to order 2 other prints.  They wash beautifully.  Wear so comfortably.  The pockets are the key. Would love if they would come up with a sleeved version!,1
power brick included,Helpful!. I used to live in the midwest. In the winter  it was dark when I went to work and dark when I came home. I was never diagnosed with SAD  but I believe I suffered from it. I live in the south now and it has been better. Though this winter  we've had a lot of grey days. On those days  it's easy to feel lethargic. This light has been helpful! It provides outdoor light  indoors! It's easy to use. The buttons are on the lower front. This comes with the power brick which was nice. A lot of electronic items I've gotten recently don't come with one any more. I have this light set up in my home office. Not only does it help boost my overall mood  but it gives me a bright work space which I like. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the little stand on the back of it. It feels like it's going to break easily. So far it's doing okay  but when you move it to get it positioned  it seems questionable. Other than that  I am enjoying this lamp.,1
James Galway,"5 stars alone for including Brian Kennedy's magnificent ""Carrickfergus""!!. I am an all-out Brian Kennedy fanatic. Brian who  you ask? Brian Kennedy  Belfast-born singer with a voice of spun gold  was Van Morrison's back up singer for several years  recorded the *original* You Raise Me Up (NOT Josh Groban)  starred in hundreds of Riverdance on Broadway shows  and for all of that  he's unheard-of in the US. Celtic Circle 2 includes Brian's soul-wrenching rendition of ""Carrickfergus "" a beautiful song of lament  accompanied only by Brian's less-is-more acoustic guitar. Haunting.  Besides the wonderful gift of Brian Kennedy  Celtic Circle 2 builds on the solid combination of modern Celtic music and Irish-influenced New Age that was so successful on Vol. 1. This time around  we have two discs of the Chieftains (the timeless ""Love Theme from Barry Lyndon"" and ""The Foggy Dew"" with Sinead O'Connor)  Clannad (Caislean Oir  Newgrange  Almost Seems)  Maire Brennan  Irish-American powerhouse Cherish The Ladies  Aine Minogue  Nightnoise  fabulous Irish bagpiper Davy Spillane  James Galway  and the stellar team of Susan McKeown and Natalie Merchant on ""River."" Sarah McLachlan even makes an early appearance with Celtic-inspired ""Drawn To The Rhythm."" My only lament is that Loreena McKennitt wasn't featured Ms. McKennitt's early works were classical Celtic-influenced melodies set to famous poems  accompanied by harp.  It's a much-welcome breath of fresh air to see Celtic and New Age done so well  as BMG has consistently shown on its ""Celtic Circle"" releases. So many ""Celtic"" releases are in fact substandard New Age treacle with anonymous vocals and synth instruments  but here we have 30 outstanding tracks that capture the lyric  melancholy beauty of the Irish nature  recorded by masters of the trade (the Chieftains have been around for more than three decades!). Yes  there are New Age pieces  too  tracks from Lord of the Rings and Titanic  but there is a much more balanced look at modern Celtic on Celtic Circle 2 than on the first (more Celtic  less New Age).  Perfect music for relaxing to at the end of a long day -- light a few candles  close your eyes  and let the soothing Celtic melodies inspire and refresh your weary spirit.",1
formula isn't waterproof,New Favorite!!. Every mascara claims to be new and different. This one actually lives up to the hype. The fibers have a novel shape that really makes your lashes POP. If you're not a fan of falsies  this is a great alternative. The formula isn't waterproof  so keep that in mind. I HIGHLY recommend this product.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,0
aggressive than one would ever believe,Aggressive Snakes and Gore. I kind of enjoyed this movie  but it was very predictable.  It was far fetched.  The snakes looked rather fake and seemed more aggressive than one would ever believe  even hyped up with pheromones sprayed on flowers in the plane to excite the snakes.  I noticed one kid's review  but I wouldn't take any kids to see this movie.  Not only are there some very gory scenes there is also a semi-nude scene.  Shortly into the movie a guy is clubbed to death with a baseball bat and while you don't see it happen  you do see the splatter of blood coming out and all over the assailant.  Some kids are fascinated with snakes and probably wanted to see this movie  but it is not appropriate for children in any way.  Samuel Jackson is his usual charming self and was fun to watch.  Too many things here don't add up in this movie and it really takes a stretch of imagination to believe it.  The movie is so far out it is almost laughable.  I can't quite figure out who this movie was made for.  They could have done a much better job on the movie  but went too much overboard on many things.  Stuff just doesn't happen this way.  Hard to say why I enjoyed it somewhat.  I wouldn't know who to recommend this movie to.  It will probably quickly fade away as it has very little to redeem it.,0
Beautiful designs,Beautiful designs. Love it.  Good paper stock,1
hair feels very slick,You get ONE PIECE. Important to realize. Well  I am not sure why someone would want this particular hair piece. It is ok  and the hair feels very slick. But you only get ONE piece  so it would not be enough for most hairstyles.  I misplaced my photos  but will add them when I find them. It is just super important to realize you do not get a whole hairpiece  but just one small clip's worth of hair. To look like the vendor photo  you would need to buy 10-12 of these.,1
small iPad mini or Kindle would fit fine,A lovely leather tote!. This tote by Pascado is nice. It is rugged and well made. There are shoulder straps (two sizes). The leather is an orangey-brown  which will match most outfits. The inside of the bag is lined. There are two front pockets (magnetic closures) and a rear zippered one. There are also two side pockets which are useful if you want to slip an umbrella inside. The size of the tote is decent and can hold a variety of items (essentials and a small electronic). *The electronics I would consider are a small iPad mini or Kindle. Either would fit fine. The front or side pockets can hold a small cell phone or keys. I have a OnePlus cell phone that fits fine. And finally  I love that this company always encloses a nice “thank you letter ” which is a great touch! I’d recommend this tote.,1
no grill to clean or grilling on a surface that might not be cleaned well,"Convenient. These disposable grills are awesome for a quick  easy bbq.  They are perfect for ""precooked"" like hotdogs/brats.  If you want to grill something raw  chicken/beef  I find a piece of foil over the top of cooking food is helpful to focus the heat.  I love that the ""charcoal"" is all natural and no lighter fluid is necessary. I use the smaller size when it's just me. The larger size cooked 8 hotdogs and 4 brats easily (space).  I also like the sanitary aspect of using these... no grill to clean or grilling on a surface that might not be cleaned well. NOTE:  Beware of using the wire brushes on your grill - the metal brissles can be ingested and puncture your intestines - which is life threatening not to mention painful!  When using a regular grill  once the grates have cooled you can soak the grill grates in garbage sack with a little detergent. Next day  hose them off. Yeah  it's a little more of a hassle  but NO metal brissles to ingest. All in all  these disposable grills are really meant for ""lightweight"" grilling projects. I just like the additional positive aspects of using them  like the cleanliness aspect. Hope this info helps!",1
suspense,Liked it a lot. Samantha  a nurse is kidnapped by an FBI agent on the run with a young boy. She ends up going on the run with them and helps him to discover who wanted them dead. A lot of suspense  a good plot and decently written. A few misspelled words and bouncing between POV's without warning was confusing. Also  too many scenes were neatly explained away and too many simple daily functions were never included which took away the believability of the story. Aside from that I adored the family dynamic and the happily ever after.,1
disappointed about reflective leaf on the back neck,"green turtleneck. Slimfit green turtleneck... I am 5'7""... 38DDD - I usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  It fits well.. I sized up because it notes ""fitted"" and I am uncomfortable if my shirts are too tight.  It was a good idea.  I gentle washed and low tumble dried - did great.  Didn't notice any obvious shrinkage.  The sleeves are just right - I don't like it if the sleeves are too short.  The material is soft and comfy.  The turtle is not super tight - but fitted.  The green is a lovely forest green.  The one thing I am disappointed about is there is a large  reflective leaf on the back neck of the shirt.  Yuck.  If I would have known that  I would not have purchased.  It's about 3/4"" and the turtle does NOT cover it.  So right on your the back of neck  a giant reflective leaf.  Eh.",0
run for 15 minutes at a time,Great value. A great little cleaner that actually heats the water.  I wish it would run for 15 minutes at a time instead of 5  but the unit would probably overheat.,0
quality,Great fit. Perfect fit and perfect quality.,1
concerned about using it,just what i needed. so far one cat  (the one i was concerned about using it)  went in  so  so far so good  i think the other one will be fine with it and i love the HIGH sides  hopefully will keep the area cleaner without litter all over the place,0
fresh strawberries with saffron-vanilla sugar,Fantastic blend of complete menus  seasonality  and international flavors. My friend and James Beard Award-winning cookbook author Meike Peters recently released her latest cookbook “365: A Year of Everyday Cooking and Baking” and graciously sent a copy to me here in Japan  where I eagerly pored over the gorgeous food photography with its tantalizing  jewel-like salads.  Meike’s cooking is very much guided by the seasonal calendar  and in “365”  you’ll find a year’s worth of complete menus (including salads  soups  pasta  sandwiches  vegetables  seafood  meat and sweets) that make the most of seasonal produce  marrying them with a range of international influences including hearty German fare  Middle Eastern  and Mediterranean flavors and inspirations.  With the falling of the leaves and the arrivals of colder weather and flurries  the recipes featuring bright  sunny citrus are a welcome respite. Dishes like Winter Caprese with Blood Orange  Beet and Mozzarella di Bufala  Spaghetti with Ricotta  Orange and Crispy Sage Chocolate and Orange Pannetone  and Sicilian Orange Salad with Olive Oil  Marjoram  and Flaky Sea Salt are sure to stave off winter colds and chase the winter blahs away with the generous amount of vitamin C.  Others like Potato and apple-stuffed cabbage rolls with Walnut Butter and Gruyere  German beef  beet and potato stew  and Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Shallots and Apple  provide stick-to-your-ribs comfort.  The salads are a particular delight  including the rainbow potato salad with radishes  shallot vinaigrette and poached eggs  beet and apple carpaccio with pomegranate  raw asparagus and peach salad with orange blossom water and pecorino  and rainbow potato and cucumber salad with dill-pistachio pesto that will bring a splash of color (and flavor!) to overcast days.  Seasonal ingredients are given light-handed treatments that allow their individual textures and delicate flavors to shine  like fresh strawberries with saffron-vanilla sugar  watermelon caprese with mozzarella di bufala  basil and mint  and squash pasta with orange  maple and sage.  If you are someone who  like me  can never seem to come up with a complete menu  that’s one of the beauties of 365: You can also use the weekly menu planner to come up with a seasonal balanced meal by combining the various options for a given week.  I was absolutely intrigued by the idea of candied cherry tomatoes slow roasted and tossed with olive oil  confectioner’s sugar  and herbs  they dissolve into a silky confit that is the perfect complement for fresh pasta and tiny basil. Plus the leftover oil and tomatoes make a fantastic dipping oil!  Measurements and temperatures are provided in both US / Imperial and metric.  This has become one of my favorite cookbooks of the last several years highly recommended.,1
durable and longevity,Unique look and shape- good button reach and response.. impressed!!!. With a teen who’s tough and unforgiving on controllers- “bc  that IS actually a thing..” I’ve been told- gamers get aggressive and even wear out buttons and such to stay alive. Hmm.. just trying to wrap my mind around the fact.. he does realize this is only simulated war survival?! Ha!  Choosing a replacement controller: I try for a happy  medium.. cheaper versions seem to have connectability issues and/or stops functioning for no reason- wasting $! I’ve also found higher $$$ does not always equate to durable or longevity!! Not interested in extra whistles/bells.. I’d rather just a solid build and ergonomic fit in the hand- and  this met our requirements!  Built with a different body shape than the standard PS4 controller- it still has a nice reach for button control. Flippers feel substantial with expected response time. Paint/wrap is cool.. but  it’s just an aesthetic feature. Ha ha… obviously won’t Improve your game skills but  a nice identifier if playing with group- very unique.  Connection to charge is snug..and this matters so  if plugged in overnite -it’s game ready the next day. Rumble pack  sound  blinking lights- are extra bling features that don’t affect gaming.. this has what it needs where it matters most.  Used x10 days daily by one who’s “life depends on it..” as we have established!! So far  so good- makes a great gift for a PS4 enthusiast! Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone.,1
Poetry Magazine,"The Best (No Further Title Required). As a poet  there are a few places I'd love to be published. There's the New Yorker  the Atlantic  and Poetry Magazine. There are other places I want to see my work  but these three are  to me  huge. They vet the best poems  and publish them.  Only Poetry focuses on poetry. A review of their history would tell you they have tenure. Great poets are published here. Ones we all know  and ones we all should know. Unlike the New Yorker and the Atlantic  Poetry is especially open to unknowns. If you are good enough  you are in  whether you are famous or not.  Like most literary magazines  the design is clean  almost simple. Here  considering everything from paper color to typography  poems are more than printed: they are framed. No  no  no fancy design. Rather  they clear the way so that the poems are highlighted. Nothing but.  An essay and a few reviews finish each issue  followed by a couple pages of ads. All black and white.  If you are looking to buy a true literary magazine  as much curated as it is edited  pick this one. Don't do it to ""support the arts "" but because each issue is worth the time and money.  I fully recommend Poetry.  Anthony Trendl americanspeechwriter.com",1
waist band keeps rolling down,Big  loose and comfy. Not sure what I thought I was getting  but I wouldn't use these for outdoor (or even in the gym) use. They are super comfortable  baggy/loose and are great for sleeping or just lounging around the house. I don't like the waist band  found it keeps rolling down when I wear them (have to keep pulling them up). I think they are soft and comfy  but not for me for yoga or any other type of sport (unless I am going to use them in my home).,0
6 000 reviews,The dept of sensitive crimes. Purchased this for my 83 year old Mom  she loves the author.  This is a series in case you're interested in checking into it.  I think it is actually #1 of 3 (?).  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - nearly 6 000 reviews posted  viewed over 50 000 times  and over 24 000 likes.,1
egg and cheese dishes,"Note: This is the US version / reprint of ""Curry Easy Vegetarian"". Earlier this summer  I ordered the excellent &#34[[ASIN:0091949475 Curry Easy Vegetarian]] from the UK as I adore Madhur Jaffrey (and vegetarian Indian cookbooks in general  especially the two fantastic Gujarati cookbooks by [[ASIN:1444734717 Prashad Cookbook: Indian Vegetarian Cooking]]. True to form  this is an excellent  informative guide to vegetarian cooking across India that includes over 200 recipes for vegetables (roasted  stir-fried  curry)  dals  grains (pilaf  flattened rice  upmas)  breads and pancakes  numerous delicious egg and cheese dishes  chutneys  and drinks  sweets and desserts. From what I can tell  &#34Vegetarian India&#34 appears to be identical (as referenced in the book's title page) but in US measurements  so if you already own &#34Curry Easy Vegetarian &#34 you will be getting the exact same recipes. This is a lovely  user-friendly introduction to vegetarian Indian cuisine highly recommended.",1
talks about Jesus and the reason for the season,Good board book for toddlers. This is a good size board book  harder for little hands to hold but recommended for 3 year olds or so. I was actually surprised that is was as large as it is. Its dramatic though and its an amazing story about the tale of the candy cane. Talks about Jesus and the reason for the season. Very well written  the artwork is beautiful.,1
tested the antivirus,"A good internet security solution. I upgraded to Panda Internet Security 2007  Platinum Edition (I'll just refer to it as ""Panda"" hereafter)  from Trend Micro's PC-Cillin suite after a recurring issue forced me to make a decision. I had had good experiences with Trend and was loathe to change  so changing was not something I really wanted to do. After checking my options and doing some research  I decided to give Panda a chance.  Panda's installation was a bit sluggish but it was not unreasonably slow. It did all of the prerequisite checks before configuration and finally it determined that it was ready to install itself. The installation at this point was smooth and straightforward and when it was done it (understandably) asked me to reboot the system.  Once the system rebooted  I was off to the races. Panda immediately started to look at programs that were trying to access the network  it flagged me down when I had incoming port scan attacks  and it dutifully logged everything going on. It also did something else - it started giving pop-up bulletins. Within 30 minutes I must have received 3 or 4 pop-up bulletins that contained informational messages  not alerts that demanded attention. While these can be configured to not show up  I was just a little annoyed by the frequency under the default settings. These bulletins have decreased since that time.  Panda's first order of business was to eliminate everything it considered to be spyware. This equated to deleting a lot of cookies. Most of these were benevolent  but some were obviously tracking cookies. Panda also seems to be eliminating these types of things when they first reach the system  which in my opinion is a good policy.  The firewall does what you would expect a firewall to to - it keeps unwanted traffic out and it prevents programs from reaching the net without your knowledge or approval. A program can be ""locked down"" and denied all access  and through the firewall profile you can make changes and tweaks to access.  I did some testing with the antivirus  and it worked relatively quickly to scan the entire system. I was able to tell it to work in the background with reduced CPU requirements and as a result the system did not slow down enough to make it unusable. As of yet it has not found a virus on the system so I just don't know how it will react to one when/if it finds one. My assumption is that I will get another pop-up bulletin.  The integrated antispam has yet to prove itself. I use a different antispam product  but Panda still does an evaluation on every inbound message. So far it seems to be properly marking messages as spam or not spam by the footer it places at the bottom of every message  but the other product I use has done the bulk of the work already. I am waiting to see how Panda handles spam messages that slip through the gauntlet and into my inbox. What I have seen thus far suggests that it will probably manage well enough. The antispam does integrate with Outlook automatically and gives a couple of new buttons for classifying spam when it comes.  By default  the parental control feature is turned off  and I decided to turn it on. This is one of the features of Panda I don't especially like. It manages access through the parental controls by way of profiles with passwords. So  when you have an internet connection and you have parental controls turned on  Panda requires a password just to get out the net at all. Granted  this is only required one time for the connection  but it is cumbersome and annoying. This type of set-up is not well-suited for family computing but is better for office and academic environments. After testing it for a little while and determining that it seems to work fairly well  I turned it off to avoid getting chastised by my family. I would likely use this more if there was a way to tell it to filter the same way for everyone without requiring a password.  Panda queries for updates daily. This is reassuring to me  knowing that I am almost always very current and have the latest signature files. I regard this as mostly psychological though  as I doubt I will ever encounter a virus that is new enough to require this tight of an upgrade schedule. The heuristic scan feature of the antivirus is likely to handle anything like that anyway.  One of the more interesting features of Panda is the TruPrevent functionality. Basically  this is a behavioral analysis of applications and processes on the system  which looks for unusual or suspicious activity. So far this has turned up nothing on my system  but it is reassuing to know it's running in the background. This kind of analysis should be used cautiously  though  as there is always a potential for false positives.  Visually  Panda is a very simple and straightforward application with a no-nonsense interface. You are not going to be overwhelmed with buttons and sliders and lists and everything else all jumbled on the screen in one big box  but rather everything is kept as simple as possible. Sometimes this means having to dig a little to find the setting you need  but honestly I think the interface is reasonably self-explanatory.  The most difficulty I had with Panda was in registering the product. I got a pop-up bulletin that offered a discount if I registered then  and I had already made my mind up to do so  so I followed the offer link. I was taken to a page all in Spanish (this is not entirely unexpected as I believe that Panda is based in Spain). I manageed to reach the English equivalent page  entered the requisite information and the website returned a very short error message. I got through several hours later and got through the registration process  only to find that I was sold the wrong product from the link. To resolve the issue I had to call their office and work it out on the phone.  With only a couple of minor annoyances and one registration issue  I have had a very positive experience with Panda. The application is not overly burdensome to my computer  it seems to be very quick and efficient  and it has kept me informed of issues as they arise. I consider this a good solution and I am happy to recommend it.",0
serums/products are cloudy and off color,These came and are completely Rotted. I have bought this product before so I know this is a bad batch. The product has rotted  the smell literally permeated like rotten garbage and the serums/products are cloudy and off color. I dared to put on the night serum  thinking is is just me? No. I woke up to a face full of red itchy bumps. I have to throw out.,0
didn't work for me,It didn't really work for me  but the ingredients show it might work for others. Rating as 3 stars because  after taking this for several weeks now  I am not  seeing the results I was expecting. My nails especially send to be brittle and weak (probably because of years of wearing acrylic nails). I was really hoping that taking this would eliminate the need for me to use special nail polish for nail hardening. It didn't. I still see my nails in the same condition. This may work for others  but it didn't for me. Maybe I need to take it for several months  unsure  but I didn't want to buy another bottle if I didn't see it at least starting to work. I also don't care for the drops with this and having to drink it. Would have preferred a pill format.,0
hard workouts with this band,Decent if you’ve never worked out before.. It’s a little stronger than the rubber types you can get but too long to do much with it but what you are able to do with it aren’t hard workouts with this band. Not worth your money.,0

box was dented,It wasn't worth it !!. Well it was worth a shot ! But I gotta pass cause as you can see from beginning to end the last photo its not looking good   my plant arrived in bad shape and the driver left the box upside down ( no way to tell which end was up ) after getting it planted I was hoping it would make it 😬but its dieing 😭slowly its going the process of shipping was just to hard for it so I wont be continuing my Subscription 😞 2 leafs left barely hanging on !! I really think the care given to the plant during shipping was crap ! Maybe a brighter box like orange or red with a warning or fragile ! For shippers to take notice idk but the box was just thrown around like all the rest ! The box was dented   you could see it was not handled well ! So try the service if you want but thats my story 🙏🌿🌱🌵🍀🙏,0
salt takes a toll,touch and hold smooth dual door closer system. Husband purchased these to replace some others that had given up the ghost.  We live on the oceanfront and the salt takes a toll.  These are nice because you can do it with your foot (when install at the base of the door) just tap it and it stays open  tap again and it releases.  Easy Peasy.

easy to clean,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
scripted,A great career while it lasted. Finally settled in last night to watch this movie. Let me start by saying that I love a good mystery and that I usually enjoy these kind of movies. Not much more can I say that hasn't been said before. First  the acting was absolutely awful. The movie is so scripted  it's almost as if the actors are reading their lines. The roles and characters are more than predictable (i.e. you have all token nationalities in the 'bad guy' gang  so they are equal opportunity offenders). I found most of the action in the fight scenes to be totally absurd. I could no more see Kim B. slinging a tire iron at someone (and getting it lodged in the victim's nostrils) then my mother doing it. It was almost comical. The underlying piece of Kim's marriage to an abusive man  was also ridiculously scripted and acted (damn  if any housewife kept a house as dirty and junk filled as she did  who wouldn't be yelling at her from time to time?). Anyway  just reliving this movie to write this review is painful. The movie was like a bad Saturday Night Live/MadTV skit. Run  don't walk  from buying or even renting this one.,0
not worth anything,Not worth the money after a while. I was subscribed for almost a year. The 1st box was the best  and it went down hill from there. Very expensive and not worth anything,0
sizing off,Nice product  sizing off!. Product is well made  but sizing seems way off for women. I purchased the XS for women's size 6  and they are so tight that my toes are bent under and the ankle opening is unbearably  circulation-cuttingly tight. They looked like doll's socks  for real. Sent them back for a size small instead. My husband's XL fit perfectly for his size 10.5 shoes! Snug  but not uncomfortably so.,0
fit,Dont fit!. Seams on top of shoe irritation to big toe.,0
She loves it,greatest hits. Bought it as a gift for my mother for Christmas  it was a big hit. She loves it and plays it all the time,1
wireless charging not working on iPhone 11 Pro and LG Android phone,Great Size!. This is a great size for a UV cleaner. It's perfect for phones  earbuds  keys  mask  and more. My daughter has an iPhone 11 Pro and it fits nicely inside. It is easy to operate. The button is right on top. We couldn't get the wireless charging to work on either her iPhone or my LG Android phone.,0
sizing was specified correctly,"Medium compression socks in a fun “normal sock” style blue hearts are attractive socks run large. This is my fifth pair of Lollop compression socks. However  two of the pairs are a small/medium size and three are medium large. This is a medium/large and runs a bit big.  I take a size 9 to 9.5 in a woman's shoe and 7.5 to 8 in a man's boot. I ordered these in a medium / large size which is supposed to be for that size foot. However  they are way too big in the foot area as the heel comes halfway up my ankle. They do fit around the calves nicely  however.  I love that they offer medium compression (15-20 mmHg) around my calves and some compression on the soles of the feet and arches. I felt comfortable in them all day without feeling like the life was being squeezed out of my legs. I also like the ""normal sock"" look of these knee-highs and they wash well in the washer but I lay them flat to dry. The blue hearts are very attractive even though the off-white is a bit dingy looking. I consider these socks very stylish. The material is 45% cotton  40% nylon  and 15% spandex.  If the sizing was specified correctly  this would have gotten 5 stars. ",0
Loved for 40+ Years,Good Old Tunes!!. I’ve Loved Moody Blues for 40+ Years Finally Bought an album,1
combat imbalanced,Good concept  but implementation falls flat. I bought this game based solely on the description on the box. I expected a game that had a trailing camera with good graphics  interesting combat  and an engaging storyline. I came away disappointed.  The most disappointing aspect of the game is the combat engine. Instead of a realtime hand-to-hand combat system  combat is turn-based. This in itself is not a problem. However  when engaged in combat  the participants run forward  take a swing  and run back. They take turns doing this until someone drops. The whole scenario comes across almost like a game of turn-based bumper cars.  Another issue with combat is the unexpected encounters that occur. In the opening stages of the game  the character must wander about in the woods  and very frequently the travel is interrupted by a message to prepare for combat. Often  that there are enemies nearby is a surprise as they do not show until the battle is joined. This kind of encounter occurs throughout the game.  Combat is often imbalanced as well. It is too easy to die.  The dialog options are somewhat uninspired as well  and the main character frequently talks to herself when trying to interact with inanimate objects. This is disconcerting  if nothing else.  There are good and bad aspects to the graphics. The graphics engine itself is good  and the rendered graphical images are very pretty and inspiring. There is plenty of eye candy in this game for those that like pretty graphics and lots of detail. However  one aspect of the graphics that is frustrating is the changing camera perspective. It switches automatically from a side view to a top-down view depending on area transitions  and in the top-down view it is difficult to tell where the player is going and what is in the surrounding area.  The storyline itself is engaging  and the developer did a nice job with it. Some of the side quests leave much to be desired  though  so it is a mixed bag in terms of gameplay.  If I had to compare it to other games in the same general genre  I would describe it as a hybrid mix between Dungeon Siege and Arcanum. Unfortunately it borrows a little too heavily from Arcanum's pitfalls.  I came away disappointed with this title. It has some good ideas and concepts that have been incorporated into it  but the implementation of those ideas make it less than ideal. Some players may find this game to be a refreshing change from 1st-person style gaming  but I found it to be clunky and awkward. I would recommend this title only to those who want to explore the storyline and are not too concerned about the implementation.,0
worth money,Not worth money. Doesn’t remove anything from skin even after steaming the pores before,0
great game,great game. play this game all the time.  so far no boredom.  very unusual for me -- easily bored invalid type.,1
khachapuri shakshuka,“There is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”. Susie Fishbein’s bestselling series “Kosher By Design” goes out with a bang with the final ninth volume “Kosher By Design Brings It Home.” Inspired by Susie’s travels to France  Italy  Mexico  Israel  and North America  you’ll find kosher versions of favorites such as Korean short ribs  lasagna bolognaise  and shoyu tamago ramen (which normally has a pork-based broth here in Japan).  I have several kosher cookbooks that I cook from regularly (Including The Joy of Kosher and “The New Kosher”)  but this was my first experience with the “Kosher By Design” series.  The menu leans most heavily towards Israeli and Italian dishes  including staples like arancini (fried stuffed risotto)   ravioli  Tuscan bean and farro soup  veal scallopini  brachiole  (fried) pizza Napolitana  ragu Napolitano  and lasagna  but you’ll also find Asian-inspired dishes (short ribs  spicy kim chee hangar steaks   ramen  chicken adobo) and Latin flair in the form of chicken flautas  ceviche  and pulled beef tacos.  The salads and dairy / fish sections were particular favorites of mine. I love light  refreshing salads for nearly every meal  and the Israeli-inspired salads here are perfect for hot  hazy days when you don’t feel like spending hours at the stove. I loved the Provencal wheatberry salad  Lumina market salad  Carmel Spa pomegranate almond salad (I use pomegranate molasses as a salad dressing and was happy to see it in a recipe!)  kale squash Caesar salad  root vegetable apple salad  and Chedva’s warm French potato salad was a revelation: baby potatoes  haricots verts  and a tangy white wine-herb dressing made this memorable (to make it dairy  you can add crumbled feta while warm).  Poultry includes rosemary lavender chicken  Amalfi sage chicken  and mustard caper chicken  and the meat dishes include various roasts  grills  and stews: pumpkin braised short ribs are perfect for fall  while the lamb cholent “cassoulet” reminded me of my trip to France’s Perigord in 2012. Dairy dishes include decadent bread pudding  farroto  pasta frittata  and risotto  while the fish dishes really shone: I loved the silan-glazed salmon (see photo) and the showstopping citrus-glazed salmon  layered with rows of perfectly symmetrical cucumber slices atop a citrus mayo. I also enjoyed trying my hand at the khachapuri shakshuka having taught many students from Georgia  I’d long heard of the magic of khachapuri but had never tried making it before. Susie’s clear instructions (and the easy shakshuka topping save the extra for omelettes and scrambled eggs!) make this a winner for breakfast or brunch.  Vegetarians have many options in the sides chapter  including a beautiful (and deceptively simple) eggplant and tomato tart (see photo)  tershi and couscous (I’m a fan of all things pumpkin and had not heard / tried this amazing Libyan Jewish dish before)  sweet potato wontons with teriyaki dipping sauce  chestnut tomato quinoa  and freekeh pilaf. Desserts are sure to tempt with a delightfully sweet/tart lemon tiramisu  Beresheet Spa Kanafe  banana  date  and pecan cake  almond bobka ring  halvah baklava  and fudgy New Fishbein Brownies punched up with espresso powder. Recipes are clearly labeled as meat  dairy or pareve (with some having multiple options depending on dairy-free substitutions) using color-coded icons. Note that some spellings use the Hebrew / Ashkenazi variations (chummos for hummus  seviche for ceviche  bobka for babka  etc.). I love that the font is a little larger and easily readable from several feet away as I tend to cook using a cookbook holder (and the ingredients are handily in bold). Each recipe comes with a full-page photo by John Uher showcasing each dish. The recipes (main dishes in particular) tend to be more elegant / upscale than some of my other kosher cookbooks (dishes like dried fruit and quinoa stuffed capons  turkey breast with hoisin tangerine glaze  and pumpkin braised short ribs would all make wonderful holiday centerpieces)  but there are also plenty of recipes that come together quickly for weeknight meals (the eggplant and tomato tart  fish dishes  and veggie sides).  Overall  “Kosher by Design Brings It Home” is a wonderful finale to Susie’s best-selling series (with nearly 500 000 books sold) and a great way to taste the world from the comfort of your (kosher) kitchen Susie’s headnotes introduce the reader to places and people she’s encountered on her fifteen-year culinary journey spanning several continents and multiple food traditions  from Italian nonnas to Yemenite family recipes passed down across generations. But at the end of the day  in Susie’s words  “there is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”  (Thank you to the Trina Kaye Organization for the review copy!),1
shed a little,They shed a little but we're. They shed a little but were good overall,0
ok,Cleaning. Just ok,0
over-the-top acting,Poorly done (decent cast  poor plot  erratic story line and not very nice characters). Truly poor - shallow  poorly developed & unlikeable characters who didn’t seem to even like each other.  A bride who showed zero concern for her missing groom-to-be throughout the entire movie.  Poor script  weak plot and over-the-top acting.  This is drivel & a waste of time to watch.  I've read many 'cosy mysteries' and this movie tries to bring one to the screen  but the entire plot is poorly developed and the characters are unreal.  For example  one character goes from making love to her old boyfriend who soon afterwards pushes her off a cliff allegedly because she had previously broken up their relationship.  Not even soap opera good.,0
had no problems,Great strings. My brother was refurbishing a banjo and popped a string. He asked me about these  I ordered them  and he installed them. He has since finished the banjo and had no problems. The strings work great and sou d just as good.,1

loaded with antioxidants,Another great L'Oreal product!. I love L'Oreal products and have been using them for years. This daily moisturizer is great. It is loaded with antioxidants and contains a lot of great anti-aging ingredients. I have been using this daily for over a month now and I love the way my skin looks and feels. If I had any complaints it would be that I would have liked a higher than 25 SPF for use down here in Florida (so I ave to supplement it with additional sunscreen when I leave the house. Outside of that  this is a really nice moisturizer which goes on lightly and is quickly absorbed. Highly recommend.,1
dries clear,Dries Clear. I work in a special education classroom and we use glue sticks regularly with our class work. I compared this extra strength glue stick to our regular ones. It's a larger tube than the others  but I really didn't notice any difference in the glue capabilities. It's a good glue stick. It goes on purple and dries clear. It will probably remain my go-to glue stick brand.,1
4 inch size,Save many a mess. With these plant saucers  there have been no excess water spills on my windowsills during  watering day.  I like the 4 inch size.  Saucers larger than needed are unattractive.,1
edges will pinch,"goose neck cell phone/device holder. I was really hoping to love love this... and I do like it.. PROS - Like having a third arm/hand - holds in place you choose - black or white color options  (I purchased black for husband and white for me) - table clamp is easy to attach if you have a perfectly flat table (top and bottom) up to 2"" thick or so - using twisting tube attached to the base. -NOTE:  There is a ""con"" to this as well. - The coil is very  very difficult to manipulate.  BUT it once you get it there  it stays exactly where you place it. CONS - the clamp is really really stiff and difficult to stretch enough to hold your phone or device.  If you have any strength issues  this might not be the best choice.  Also  they edges will pinch you if you accidentally get your fingers in the way of the spring loaded clips. - The table clamp only works with tables that are flat on top and bottom.  The place I wanted to clamp on has a groove underneath and my husband had to make a wooden block of sorts for the table clamp to work.  Overall  I like the stand - but the engineering that is required to make a strong  stable holder  also makes it difficult to use.  Just sayin.",0

healthy,Simple recipes for a long life  the Shoku-Iku way!. Much like the traditional Japanese Buddhist shojin ryori  Shoku Iku (“food education”) is a Japanese concept involving conscious eating: what we eat  how we prepare it  and how different foods are combined. Much like the traditional Japanese Buddhist shojin ryori  shoku iku is based on the power of five: each meal should have five colors (green/blue  red/orange  white  black/brown  yellow)  tastes (sweet  sour  bitter  salt  umami)  senses  food groups and cooking methods (steam  simmer  broil  grill and fry  no-cook  sushi).  Makiko Sano’s new book “Healthy Japanese Cooking” (published in the UK as “Shoku Iku”) immediately caught my eye having lived in Japan on multiple occasions  I have long been attracted to Japanese washoku (traditional cuisine) and shojin ryori (Buddhist vegan cuisine). Traditional Japanese meals are based on the freshest seasonal ingredients  engage all the senses  and if eaten properly and with mindfulness  should leave you satisfied but not stuffed (the Japanese concept of hara hachi bu  or eat until you are 80 percent full).  Beginning with the essential dashi (stock) and dressings (rosemary soy  sweet soy  sesame salad sprinkle  shabu shabu and others)  there are very handy illustrations and step-by-step photos to instruct you on rolling sushi  julienning vegetables  etc. Dashi is the backbone of most Japanese soups / hot pots  and you'll find several variations here  including basic dashi (kelp + bonito flakes)  vegetarian dashi (kelp and dried shiitake)  Motoko's dashi (made with liquid from cooking brown rice I had not seen this method in my other cookbooks!)  and two soup stocks.  I found the chapter on steaming particularly helpful as I have not cooked fish via this method before  but you’ll find heavenly steamed sea bream  a posh cod dinner in 20 minutes  steamed chicken  stuffed veggies  pork dumplings  etc.  most cooked in the microwave. However  a word of caution these recipes were tested at 800 watts  and it would appear that American microwaves are more powerful in general (mine is 1.58 kW)  so you may need to adjust cooking times.  Some of the steamed dishes are cooked on the stovetop my new favorite discovery is the “Full Japanese” garden breakfast  full of leafy greens  tomatoes  mushrooms and eggs nestled into the greens. I also loved the vegan monk recipe for stuffed pumpkin and steamed sticky rice  which is full of carrots  shiitake  and mushrooms (you can leave out the chicken to make it vegan). And my favorite steamed custard chawanmushi also makes an appearance  as do perfect teatime snacks mochi  sweet potato treats  and fruit buns.  The fried chapter includes Japanese burgers and shrimp barbecue  but you’ll also find healthy low-fat vegetarian options like Japanese grilled vegetable “stir fry” (half grilled  half steamed)  eggplant and shallot salad  “full of goodness” (with a liberal helping of my favorite Japanese vegetable  lotus root!)  and chili tofu. The sushi chapter features an amazing brown shiitake and pumpkin sushi  temaki  sesame seed salmon sushi  brown rice tuna sushi with sweet-hot sauce  five senses super-tasty salmon sushi  and some new variations like wasabi cream cheese sushi with lamb  avocado and pear quinoa power sushi  and sushi canapes.  Ingredients are listed both in metric and US (volume). Beautiful full-color photos by Lisa Linder capture the aesthetic of Japanese cuisine  with beautiful tableware that offsets the featured dish perfectly.  The resulting dishes  all of which embrace the “shoku iku” philosophy  are light  nutritious  and provide plenty of variety of colors  flavors  and textures that are sure to brighten any meal. I found several new dishes that I plan on making frequently  including the egg and tofu dashi soup  rice noodles with mushroom broth  pan tai  iced tomatoes  brown shiitake and pumpkin sushi  and steamed sticky rice.  If you are new to Japanese cooking / flavors  then “Healthy Japanese Cooking” is the perfect introduction as it uses commonplace ingredients (you may have to order some of the more traditional ingredients like kombu and bonito flakes online)  simple techniques  and is aligned much more closely with the traditional Japanese diet based on fish and vegetables than many Japanese cookbooks aimed at Western audiences.

cancel the magazine,Don't bother!. I can't cancel this magazine.  I don't even like it.  DULL!!!!,0
love the last of the 4 so far,Pirates of the Caribbean 4 set. I am HUGE Pirates fan AND a Johnny Depp fan... so double bonus for me.  You have to own all 4 if you're going to watch them. Each one good in it's own way.  Clearly the first is one of the best.  However  I personally love the last of the 4 so far.  I love the mermaids.  Oooo.  Watch out guys.  In any case... I would say ok for age 8 and up... but that is a personal thought... to each their own I don't judge.,1

still in one piece,Even the box cat loves these bags!. Happy with this product. Cats love playing in  on  and with these bags. So far  still in one piece. Would buy again.,1

padded,Super comfy with great coverage!. I found it  the perfect most comfortable bra ever!  I am a very large 338 lb. woman and this bra has super great under-the-arm and back coverage and it feels so comfy like I'm wearing nothing at all while providing great support.  I also love a padded bra so my nipples don't show!,1
arrowhead feature is opalescent and rimmed with cheap gold color,Cheap looking gold tarnished. Really fake  brassy gold color. Pretty disappointed. The tips of the earrings  the part that goes thru your earlobe  were tarnished upon unpacking. The arrowhead feature is opalescent and rimmed with this cheap gold color. I’d never ever reorder these.,0
biased towards the west coast,Still not very good. I had a subscription to this magazine a few years ago. I let my sub run out because the magazine was not that good. I decided to give it another try and see if this magazine had improved. Nope  still the same old magazine. The gear reviews always seem to review the high end gear that only a small percentage of people can afford.   The articles are usually about hiking trails that are the top tier trails. PCT  AT  CDT  etc. How about some trails that are in different states that do not take MONTHS to finish! Some nice weekend trails would be awesome!! Seems like this magazine has always been biased towards the west coast. You know  there are many  many other trails in the US  across all 50 States!! Not just CA!  So  looks like this sub will be just like the first time I subbed. Going to let it expire. I can find better content on youtube anyways!,0
washes well,great set. it is soft and warm and fits perfectly. washes well too. a great buy for the money. great seller!,1
loves his 'bacuum',Grandson LOVES. Oh boy.  My grandson LOVES LOVES LOVES his 'bacuum.&#34  He wants to mess with Mommy's vacuum and it's simply too heavy and dangerous.  So  we found this one.  It does NOT actually vacuum  which is a shame  cause he runs it every where!  He's 2 1/2 years old. It appears to be good enough quality to be around for a while.,1
writing was wonderful,Rich but sad story. The writing was wonderful. The story was often heartbreaking and then a turn for the better would help me to the next chapter. I'm glad I read it  but wished I hadn't stopped and started with it so much.,1
use gloves or tweezers,fabric fusion glue. Ok.  This stuff works.  IF you're gluing FABRIC to FABRIC.  Nothing else.  And NO felt.  Another note.  Use gloves or tweezers to apply.  Wash immediately if you get any on your skin.  If you have 2 layers  makes sure to put something plastic between the two layers.  I haven't tried to wash it yet  but I think it's pretty solid.  Having said all of that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
Perfect size,Perfect size. These pots are attractive  durable  and a great value.  They are perfect for succulents  and their 4 inch size allows room to drop in a 3 inch planting pot.  I love the wooden saucer  and will be looking for it whenever I shop for planters again.,1
come with covers,These do not fit my diamond clean toothbrush. I cannot try these due to them not fitting my toothbrush.  The bristles are about medium bristles and come with covers.,1
never hesitate to update my reviews,deli style (chunky) relish. This is really hard to find locally.  I purchase this  the sweet and the dill.  I like it because it's chunkier  bigger than the fine grind on other brands.  It also tastes better to me (of course that's personal opinion).  I wish I could get it locally  but Amazon is always my 'deliver to you door' backup.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should any new info seem useful.,1
tool bag is worth it's weight in gold,Dewalt Max Lithium-Ion 4 tool set. My husband is a project manager.  Uses Dewalt tools every day and for many  many years.  While this kit is NOT the most powerful tools Dewalt offers  he says that they are perfectly fine for home use.  Further he believes that the tool bag is worth it's weight in gold.  It keeps tools readily available and is handy to use in carrying the tools to your project area.  I have to admit most of the men I've seen looking over the tools are ooing and ahing over the actual tool bag.  We purchased this on &#34Prime Sale Day&#34 and my husband believes that we paid a fair sale price.  While it wasn't a &#34steal&#34 it was well worth the money spent.  Everything listed was included... and interestingly the piece that my husband thought he would not use much has turned out to be the most used at this time - the flashlight!  The tools are fairly heavy pieces so I am not sure I will be used them as a girl (ha) but they are certainly doable.  I always update my reviews if new info would be helpful.  Finally  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.,1

detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites,"Ahhhh ... my favorite magazine. I'm not an archaeologist. If I was born redundantly wealthy I think that I might have been one.  Archaeology is my ""stop everything and read it on the day it arrives"" magazine. I've been a subscriber for years. I read EVERY article. As a reader of archaeology and paleontology tomes  this magazine is the adjunct to my selections of books to read. My wife and I have planned vacations around Archaeology's articles.  I've detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites.  During a cross country moving event 7 years ago  I let the subscription expire for lack of new address. Someone from Archaeology  not a telemarketer for sure  called me and said that I had been such a long term customer that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew ... was it something about the magazine quality? The voice on the other end was just so dang disappointed as she pleaded for feedback that it was stunning enough for me to remember 7 years later. The magazine must be read by a small but dedicated subscriber base and I think the magazine staff themselves makes the calls.  My only complaint is that it only prints every 2 months. If archaeology is among your interests  you would entertain your fancies with a subscription.",0
3 different colors,received 3 and kids loved them. We received 3 keychains that were 3 different colors and the kids loved them! They do not make noise which I LOVE! Great price and great quiet toy!,1
anhyzer release,"Awesome Disc. I beat my old distance record on the very first throw with this disc. It feels great in the hand. It's pretty stable right now  but I'm hoping it develops a bit more turn as it breaks in. I was mostly throwing hyzers  and it kept a straight line very well. My last throw of the night had a bit of an anhyzer release  and it WENT. It ended up next to a building that I thought was way out of my range. I was saying ""holy balls"" over and over again  and a park ranger felt the need to ask if I was OK. Great disc.",1
great buy,Super oily and extremely sharp be careful.. At first I really didn't like how oily they were stacked together. I literally sliced my thumb open on the first one I was trying to take off the pile. I sliced my thumb again as I was trying to wipe the oily residue off before loading the rotary cutter. So use and clean with a lot of care. I was on a time crunch to complete a project and didn't have the time for the accidents my first attempt caused me. 😂  However  as long as you are careful and use cautious care they were a great buy for a little price. I will purchase these again when I finish using all that came in the pack.  I did ask a quilter friend that regularly uses her cuter and wheels why they needed to be so gross with oil. I was told that it has to do with how many come in the stack and to keep them very sharp while being tossed about during the moving  handling  and shipping. I don't know if her answer is the reason or not but it did make sense to me.  Just handle with extreme care always. Do not let young children use a rotary cutter. And don't let teens that can barely cut with scissors use either. (I'm not being funny with the teen part they will hurt themselves.) Take my word for it. I had teens helping with the project. Only responsible people should use these extremely helpful tool! This was the best tool (along with the self healing mat) I was ever gifted!,1
Small amount of coffee grounds seemed to get out during process,Reuseable. Poor quality lid didn’t fit well.  Small amt coffee grounds seemed to get out during process,0
cleaning the litter box is much easier,My breeder uses it for her cats!. It makes cleaning the litter box much easier and it clumps very well,1
enough to share,oil syringes. I purchased these to drip a little olive oil on my popcorn!  Easy to control portion that way.  Works just as I would like.  Easy to use and clean.  There are a lot of them  so enough to share  or store of future use.  It is plastic with a rubber (or like rubber) stoppers. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful and I hope my review was helpful to you.,1
