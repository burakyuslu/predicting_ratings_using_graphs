social greetings,"Sims 2 goes out with a bang. The ""unofficial"" word is that Apartment Life will be the final expansion pack for the Sims 2 line. I don't really know if that's true  but if so Apartment Life closes the series on an up note.  Along with Seasons and Nightlife  Apartment Life is one of my favorite expansions. I really like the apartment feature  it's been long overdue. It's so much easier now to start off a sim newly graduated from University by having them live in an apartment. It's so much easier to get them suitable living quarters.  I am so glad we finally have spiral stairs and playground equipment. They were both very much needed 4+ expansions ago.  The social townies can be kind of annoying in a way  but the reputation feature is nice. One thing I don't like is how the new social greetings will mess up the greetings from locals at the Bon Voyage vacation neighborhoods. It's very rare now for my locals to do their normal greetings  instead they do the new social ones and my vacationing sims have a harder time of meeting the ""learn local greeting"" want without cheating on my part. But it's a minor frustration.  Witches are pretty interesting. I like the neutral spells but some of the evil and good witch spells are kind of blah. Plus  I'm really not into the skin overlays with the evil and good witches. I don't like the green or sparkly skin so I use a mod to stop it. But overall I do like the witches and am glad we have them. They're the only paranormal creature in the Sims 2 line I've had more than a passing interest in.  Apartment Life is a great EP and given the choice I'd gladly buy it again. I think it will keep my creativity & gameplay with Sims 2 going for a very long time.",0
just want I didn't know I needed,Great addition  makes touch more responsive. Love it  just want I didn't know I needed.,0
son's fav Christmas gift,My son's fav Christmas gift. My teenaged son loves this game. It was his fav Christmas gift. Any Pokemon fans will enjoy it.,1
sulfate free,Just as good as the named brands at a reduced cost!. I get keratin treatments for my hair probably 3 times a year. As such  I always have to use shampoos and conditioners that are sulfate free. Typically  most of the products I use are expensive  so I was looking for an alternative. I absolutely love this Amazon Brand product. Just as good as using a  more expensive salon brand  this shampoo leaves my hair soft and smooth and because its paraben and sulfate free  I  can keep it that way at much less cost. Kudos Amazon for creating another great generic product which is just as great as the named brand products. Oh  and I love the fragrance of this Argan Oil  too!,1
quick shipment,One of the greatest string quartets of all time.. Like  new even though it is 30years old.  Well packaged with quick shipment.  One of the best of all time string quartets.,1
light weight,Light Weight. We love to decorate for Halloween. This skeleton will be a fun addition to our yard display this season. He does require some assembly. It's easy though and just a matter of sliding a piece or two into place. He's very light weight. He has a sturdy rope attached to him for hanging. And since it's light weight  I don't expect any problems with him weighing down a branch or whatever we use to hang him on. He is a good size. He's a short adult size. His arms are easy to pose. I'm not convinced that he's very durable and long lasting  but I feel confident that he should last a few Halloweens.,1
great little creamers,My favorite coffee creamer. These are great little creamers  but I’d like to buy a large size  i don’t need the tiny ones…,1
Buying it in this large size saves money.,Best Motor Oil. Pennzoil is the only motor oil we have ever used.  Buying it in this large size saves money.,1
quite a few different types of chews,Great deal!. I ordered the small/medium box and my dogs love everything in it. I didn’t count how many pieces were in it before giving them to my dogs but there were quite a few different types of chews. If bought separately the individual pieces would have cost at least twice what this subscription box cost. My dogs and I are vey happy with this purchase!,1
fast read,Very fast and fun read. I was given this book for free  and my review is voluntary. This is the first book that I have read from this author. I have fallen in love with this series! It is well written. The lead female character ( July) is fast thinking and fun. The casino resort security head is sexy ...and single until he meets July and in a very dangerous situation. Even tho this is a novella that takes place in just one night  it has so much fast action in it. As you read it you can feel the excitement in the story. Good and fun read that I would highly recommend to everyone. Can't wait to read more of this series,1
no power lite,poor design. Poor design- speakers fire up & down in relation to ipod or only one speaker fires at you at 90* rotation. No power lite so easy to forget its on  low volume and tinny at max input. OK for a quiet environment but even low background noise will wash it out. Keep looking- there are better front firing units here for about $10 more- very well worth spending the extra money.,0
sounds I could get from this on my first try,I love this ocarina! So pretty and easy to use. The manual is very helpful!. Love this will practice til I can get Saria's song and Song of Storms at the very least! (Was a little dissapointed that last one wasn't on the music sheet). I am so glad with the sounds I could get from this on my first try though! I had another ocarina but it wasn't a 12 hole it was a 6 hole I believe and I had trouble getting nice sounds from it it felt a lot different from this one! I am truly in love the design is so good and pretty I did find a few spots that weren't very well painted though but overall I am totally in love with my new Ocarina &#603,1
difficulties keeping all of the contestants straight,Fun Premise. I am mildly obsessed with reality TV shows. I watch a few big series  but I love learning about the behind the scenes stuff. This story is about a woman who signs up to be on a reality dating show. She expects it to be like all the other shows where they live in a beautiful mansion and everyone has a beautiful designer wardrobe. However  in an effort to make it more &#34real&#34  the setting is in an old  dumpy apartment complex and they are given a thrift store wardrobe. It was a funny  light read. I enjoyed all the behind the scenes action that showed how unreal a lot of the reality show activities were. I did have a little difficulties keeping all of the contestants straight in the beginning. I'm not sure what could have been done differently to keep that from happening. I read it over the course of two days. Anyway...it was a fun  entertaining story.,0
local stores only carry them seasonally,As advertised.. Husband bought for greenhouse and reports they work great and as expected.  They are one of those things you need extras of apparently and the local stores only carry them seasonally.  So Amazon to the rescue!,0
bottle is a clear blue,"Great non alcoholic nose burn when you smell it!. I love how different this smells on everyone. It shows a male jumping up on the box but I honestly think it could be for everyone. It is not a ""perfume "" scent.. It is an ""earth"" scent. On me  a female  it smells like a woodsy outdoorsy scent..one my 18 yr old grson he described it as an ""earthy orange"" scent!  The bottle is a clear blue that reminds you of the ocean..which is great because the name is ""sea""  I really love this unusual scent!",1
great price,I love Snuggle - only brand I use. I exclusively use Snuggle as my brand of choice in fabric softeners. Not only is economical to use (a little goes a long way in my HE machine)  but my clothes come out soft and smelling wonderful. When used on my bedding  I can smell the fresh scent days into use. I highly recommend Snuggle for everyone. Great size product  great price and the best on the market when it comes to softening and freshening everything.,1
gift for 11yr old,Totally worth the money and cute AF. Totally adorable and will be a gift for my 11yr old  she will love it!,1
comfortable,Nice Cotton Boxer Briefs. These have nearly everything I look for in boxer briefs.  They are tagless  comfortable  nice fitting  and look nice.  The only thing that is missing is a fly hole which is a bit annoying  but forgiveable if everything else is good.  And everything else is good.  I have put two through the wash and they look good and given the quality feel of them  I would expect that they will last well.,1
not as good as Euphoria,Best Def Leppard cd in 16 years.. Upon first listen I'm pretty underwhelmed by the guitar solos.  Some of these songs really could of used a Killer solo but ended up with instantly forgettable barely existent weak solos instead.  The songs on the other hand are much better.  Early faves are Dangerous  Sea of Love and All Time High (nice solo). It's their best cd since Euphoria   but it's not as good as Euphoria(IMO Euphoria is around 5th or 6th best Leppard cd). Definitely better than sparkle. I give it 4 /5 stars. Let's Go is good too but borrows too heavily from Sugar.,0
cats LOVE them.,I was negative about these originally because of the HUGE Shipping price  BUT.... now that the almost $20 shipping charge has been corrected from what showed on my Amazon screen to a very reasonable amount   I am VERY happy with them and my cats LOVE them.,1
Perfect,It IS Perfect!!. I'm 62 and love this primer. That's why I'm here searching for more. If the price is right I may pick up a couple more for stocking stuffers.,1
mushroom foragers,A delightful tour of the many gastronomic pleasures Quebec has to offer.... Julian Armstrong has written about food for the Montreal Gazette for more than five decades. As soon as I heard about this book  I knew it was the one for me I studied abroad for two summers in a French immersion program at Universite Laval in Quebec City and majored in French with an emphasis on Quebec Studies  so La Belle Province has a huge place in my heart. Quebec is a huge land area with great diversity in its landscape and people some regions are famous for certain products (the nickname “bleuets ” blueberries  is given to people from the Lac-St-Jean area as they grow large amounts of the fruit). Quebec also produces many excellent raw milk cheeses (which are under strict control in other provinces) and maple syrup. Its culinary heritage is strongly influenced by hearty French cuisine preferred by trappers and fur traders. “Made in Quebec” is the author’s second cookbook focusing on the cuisine of Quebec here she spent several years interviewing cheese makers  mushroom foragers  chefs and farmers  salt cod fishermen  fruit scientists and growers. The book is divided by season and include both staples (poutine  tourti&egravere  tarte au sucre  pate chinois) and modern interpretations of traditional flavours. I loved the simple  delicious vegetarian options like the gorgeous Tarte aux tomates confites au sirop d’&eacuterable et cru du clocher (Tomato Tarts with Maple Syrup) on the cover in addition to many lamb and pork dishes  there are many fish- and veggie-based dishes to enjoy. The desserts in particular are spectacular.,1
settings are not perfect,lively stones. Opals come in many different looks.  I love a white stone with plentiful but subtle fire.  The is IT.  Like others have said  the settings are not perfect  but the earrings  somewhat dainty but lovely  are beautiful.  OK  I bought them for myself--for Santa to put in y stocking  but I love them.  And I think the price is veery good.,0
Highly recommend,Nothing compares with ZZZQuil!. I have been suffering for neck and shoulder pain for years now. Getting and staying asleep has been a struggle until I found ZzzQuil. Might cost a little more than generic brands but in this case you truly get what you pay for.  This sleep aid contains acetaminophen so it allows me to alleviate pain while it coaxes me gently to sleep. I haven't been sleeping this well in years. Highly recommend for anyone who finds their sleep patterns disrupted because of pain.,1
no room,I love the quality of this. This sounds amazing  and it is a good beginer's tool  but it is huge.  I did not pay enough attention to the dimensions when I bought it.  I have literally no room for this to just stand by to use  so I must put it away after every use along with my stand for it.  I does sound great though--I only wish that it had some kind of sensors in the keys so as to tell how hard you used them...sigh  guess you can't have everything at a reasonable price point.,0
soaked with the removal solution,Very nice makeup removal pads. These are nice makeup removal pads. You get a jar with 70 of these pads that are soaked with the removal solution. And of course when you are done there is some of that solution on the bottom that you can use with regular cotton pads. These makeup pads are very nice and work well. The removal solution is very gentle  probably because it includes cica solution in it as well as some vitamins and other good ingredients.  They smell very good and I found are gentle enough to use around the eyes. I had no issues removing foundation  lipsticks are eye makeup. All in all I am very happy with these. The price is rather reasonable too at $12 for 70 of these pads. I think these should be good for sensitive people except may the fragrance that is fairly strong but pleasant. But since these are gentle enough to use around the eyes they should be good for sensitive skin.,1
amazing musical bang for your buck,The one single-disc Billy Joel hits set you really need. Hands down  far and away  this is the best single-disc Billy Joel collection you're going to find.  Anywhere  anytime.  The Hits is aptly named:  The hits and nothing but the hits  all killer and no filler.  Will it miss a favorite or two of yours?  Very likely.  Will it still pack an amazing musical bang for your buck?  Absolutely!  The ideal collection for the casual fan who doesn't care to collect a lot of albums and non-hits.  Also  an ideal set for the bigtime fan who wants a single hits disc for when they have a sudden urge to get into Billy's big ones  and nothing but the big ones.  A full Five Stars and very highly recommended.,1
cups of coffee,Don't bother. Got 3 cups of coffee from each bag of beans. Not worth the money.,1
makes his coat shiny,Great Idea and works Amazingly. This is so awesome....wish I would of found it earlier.  I have recommended it to all my friends.  Just two pumps and I rub it into his fur.  It smells amazing and makes his coat shiny and he seems to itch less too....a great solution for in-between baths....love it,1
delivered to my door for a very fair price,campbells tomato soup. Was having getting a few things like this at the store lately - virus hoarding - but I was happy to get it delivered to my door for a very fair price.  Campbells tomato soup is a staple in the comfort food department to me personally.  I use milk when I make it - extra rich with added protein.,1
falls apart easily,Good idea  not at all sturdy. This is not sturdy. Falls apart way too easily. A light blanket is not even able to be held up with it. Any little bump breaks it apart. Such a great idea  but needs to be much stronger to function.,0
love this lip primer,So Fabulous!. Of course  I love Tréstique  but I especially love this lip primer!  It’s not chalky nor sticky  but provides a great priming for Tréstique lipsticks.  I like the primer so much that I purchased them for all of my Tréstique lippies  as opposed to balm that comes with the glosses.  It gives your lipstick longevity and allows for fullest pigment payoff!,1
believing in yourself,"A moving modern-day NZ fable.. Niki Caro's ""Whale Rider"" (based on the novel by Witi Ihimaera) is an uplifting tale of tradition and inner strength. Twelve-year-old Pai (talented newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes) lives with her grandparents in a rural New Zealand town. Pai's mother and twin brother died in childbirth  and her artist father took off for Europe  where he now has a new (pregnant) girlfriend. Pai's brother was supposed to be the next chief of her tribe  and with his death Pai's grandfather Koro searches for a new (male) leader  failing to see that it is Pai that possesses the courage and talents of a chieftain. The movie is filled with a haunting soundtrack by Dead Can Dance's Lisa Gerrard  including samples of traditional Maori music by Hirini Melbourne. The cinematography beautifully captures the many moods of light and shadow on mountains and sea  as well as stock footage of majestic whales. ""Whale Rider"" is an uplifting tale of love  loss  and courage  about tradition in the face of change  and believing in yourself.",1
a little on the thin side,These are cute and soft. These are comfortable  cute and fit as expected.  They washed well and didn't fade.  They are a little on the thin side  but still a nice set of pajamas.,0
no mess in the package,Perfect condition on arrival. Super cute  it was healthy and no mess in the package.,1
smart idea,Space savers. 1st of all I love the fact that these are acrylic And not glass. I really don't like using glass in picture frames because they break if they fall off the wall or if someone knocks them over on the table. You can display these Either up and down or sideways depending on the picture. They look nice next to each other in any pattern. Very smart idea.,1
looks expensive and cool,does not look like a water shoe. purchased these for my husband  for the beach  does not look like a water shoe  nice looking can be worn with anything. It is soft  it would make a excellent house slipper for someone  it said women  but a men with shoe size 81/2 can wear a women size 10. It look unisex  never told my husband it was a women show. I would recommend it highly. Looks expensive and cool.,1
I also use it on my lower back,Fantastic product!. Works well on joints for arthritis!  I keep RELM on hand all the time…I also use it on my lower back…👍🏻,1
not natural fabric but rather composite material,save yourself a trip to the gas station. hat comes sealed and never worn  good fit for an average male head... can be tightened from there  only gripe is it's not natural fabric but rather composite (and likely flamable) material,0

bad design,Another bad design.. Forget it! It does nothing like stated. Just gets in the way!,0
leans dry,"this is a medium tint- definitely gives sun kissed glow  absorbs well  hydrates  non greasy. Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says  ""medium"" in the product description  which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level  so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle  BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink  with cool undertones. Still  I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in  but it gives me a slight tanned look  ""a sun kissed glow"".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..  This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen  using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays  converts them to heat  then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available  blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great  and it depends on what works best with  your skin.  This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious  skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter  jojoba  oilve oil  and vitamin e. It comes out thin  and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round  and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often  sweating it off  etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized  I feel better about keeping it so simple.  Again  I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the ""medium"" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a ""sun kissed glow"". If that is at all appealing to you  then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool  fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast  at all. If your skin is real oily  then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy  and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.  My skin: mid 40s  leans dry  semi sensitive  non-acne Rosacea (redness  visible veins)  I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year  and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else  it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot  and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck  then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try  and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).  I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new  or think of anything else.",1
cheaper than my usual Centrum formula,Great daily vitamin for the older woman's body!. This is my new favorite daily vitamin. Totally Vegan  easy to swallow and fills all the daily requirements of my 60+aged body. I have a tendency to skip breakfast most days a week and this vitamin agrees with an empty stomach (no aftertaste  burping  or unpleasant stomach rumblings). This is a lot cheaper than my usual Centrum formula so Amazon has once again turned me away from name brands and over to their store brand names. I highly recommend for any woman over age 40 who cares about their health!,1
gives the illusion of smooth skin,Not For Me. This product by Dermelect was not what I expected. After trying it for a few days  I've decided it's not really for me. I'm in my mid 50's now  but I don't really have any forehead lines. I guess that's good that I don't! I couldn't really figure out where I would benefit from using it. The description was kind of vague as to what it was. It's not to be massaged into the skin. It basically fills in your wrinkles and gives the illusion of smooth skin. I like the way it feels which I attribute to the dimethicone .,1
hand-painted/handmade,Two-toned delight!. These two toned faux hammered earrings are delightful. These are turquoise (smooth) and copper colored (hammered). They are hand-painted/handmade. The posts are stainless steel and nickel free. I have sensitive skin and didn’t notice any irritation or redness. While the packaging is simple  I did like that it included a “thank you” label on the box. These earrings are very classy and can be worn everyday. Overall  these are some cute earrings for under $16.,1
not really bright enough to use as a pathway light,mason jar lights. These are just the lids and lights... NO JARS.  I knew this going in  so I purchased my own jars and some polished rocks to use as weights - we have rambunctious ground squirrels.  I also purchased  separately  &#34stainless steel&#34 handles as we live on the ocean front in Oregon.  The handles were a bit of trick to get on the jar - it works best if you &#34screw&#34 them on  like a lid sort of.  I sort of twirled the lights so they hung down as a swirl down the center of the jar and then screwed the lids onto the jars.  They charge in the day  come on at dusk and mostly stay on all night long.  A couple I notice don't.. but I was only hoping for a few hours - so I'm good with this.  They are not really bright enough to use a path way light - but they are bright enough to be a very pretty decoration.  I ordered a dozen  but went back for a third set as my very determined squirrels did manage to shatter one by knocking it off even with rocks for weights!  My Mom loved them  so I let her take three of them.  She has them in her window sill  inside.  They work nicely there too.  As long as they get sun to charge  it's good.  Now  I will say  that the rings have become to rust.  I haven't tried to pop out the light portion and put a new ring on  but I may try this after the summer season is over.  All work.  I had NO failures.  Some don't last through the night  even though they have exactly the same sun exposure - but still  last for hours.  I do recommend putting something in the jars for weights even if you don't have sassy squirrels like we do as they will likely stay put better.  ..As I said I used polished rocks.. but you could use glass beads or marbles or shells that heavy or packaged sand (because its dry - don't get it off the beach) really anything that would provide weight and you can fit into the canning jar. All in all  I really like these lights... just wish the rings were more resistant to rust! They would make beautiful wedding decor  or other party decor  or individually as gifts with special inserts (weights).  My Mom adores hers.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. If I decided to try and replace the rings I will post how that went.  And I hope this info was helpful to you in some way. UPDATE 8/14/2018.... I have added some photos that might be helpful - while the outer rings have rusted... eh... they are outside.. we are oceanfront (although they would rust outdoors anywhere) -  I consider the rust &#34patina&#34  ... I may not attempt to replace the rings until they are not functional anymore - a couple seasons?? I DO recommend the separate purchase of the handles.  They make the jars a lot easier to move around. Hope this is helpful to you!,1
ink cartridge,Great clear pictures. Last 100 yrs.. Oh  another tech gadget to learn about. I am 63  I learned how to do things on my computer years ago. I cant do anything about tvs  video player hook ups though. When I got this  I thought it would be one of the hard ones because you have to sinc up your iphone with it..ahhh..but actually  if you follow the simple directions it was easy. Yes I did have an issue connecting the two but it was a matter of being patient. I figured it would be difficult to use to print from the phone...boy was I wrong! After you install the hp socket app  you just click on it and your pictures are there. ...helpful hint  it might take a minute or two the first time you sink the two for the pictures to appear on your phone screen...just be patient  it does work. After that they come up very quickly. The unit is nice and small (fits in a shoe box even with cords)  and was packed very well. It comes with 10 picture papers and 1 ink cartridge. The ink is a nice small unit that pops right in! When you have your picture that you are ready to print  you just click on the printer icon that comes up under the picture...one word of caution here... only hit it ONCE!  This is when your patience is a virtue lol. I hit it once  then waited...nothing happened...hit it again..still nothing  hmm then the on light began to flash ( the pic info was coming thru) and the picture began its printing cycle. It prints one color comes out and is sucked back in for another color. It does this 4times  then the picture comes out  drops on the tray and is done! Easy peasy! Until the second picture began to print because remb  I hit the button twice lol because I didnt wait...I didnt know then  but now I do. The second time I printed a picture I hit the print icon and waited..the picture began its cycle. After all this I can honestly say this is the easiest gadget to set up and use! Since it didnt come with much paper  I ordered more. I compared prices on 4 different sites/stores and they were exactly the same as Amazon  34.99 for 80 picture papers and 2 ink cartridges...Im guessing 1 cartridge for every 40 pictures...makes each pic cost 43.73 cents per picture  which is a bit more than printing in stores but I think those machines are harder to use so to me  this is def. worth the money. I just started to check on some features on the app for adding to pictures. There are happy birthday banners you can add to the picture before it prints and a lace one  pumpkins etc. It also has holiday things to add too! I bet there are so many more features in the app to enhance the photos that I will find as I get better using it!  In closing as you might have guessed  I love this machine and find it was the easiest thing to learn about! Get one lol,1

not quite to my ankles,Love. This kimono thing looks really awesome. I really enjoyed the look of it. Super light  so it is great for warmer weather. It does come a little past my calves  but not quite to my ankles.,1
Crosswords Plus does nearly all of the same things,"Decent  But Expensive Not Fully Functional on New Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" Tablet. CROSSWORDS by Standalone is a decent crossword puzzle app  but inflexible and expensive.  On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet  the working display shows about two-thirds of a weekday NY Times puzzle grid  and I can't find any way to resize the grid to show the whole puzzle at once. (You must swipe down or hit an arrow button to reveal the lower one-third of the grid.)  The Across and Down clues appear alongside the grid in a readable typeface  but the clues are cut off at the right.  (Perhaps this is an 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD issue that the developer will correct fortunately  clicking on a cut-off clue will display the full clue below the grid.)  The puzzle hints--found under the list icon beside the app icon  at the left--don't always work as expected.  For example  ""reveal entire puzzle"" only filled in one word (for the 1-down clue) when I started from the ""hints for 1-down"" screen.  In contrast  ""reveal entire puzzle"" filled in the entire puzzle when I started from a ""press-and-hold-on-clue"" popup.  Worse  the general settings for navigation (e.g.  ""skip filled squares""  ""show mistakes"") don't seem to function at all.  (Perhaps this is another Kindle Fire HD issue for the developer to fix.)  The app allows you to enter multiple letters in a single square  and to look up puzzle info (must-haves for NY Times crossword solvers).  If you are a NY Times crosswords subscriber  the app will automatically download the daily puzzles for you.  The app comes with an assortment of puzzles already installed  and allows you to browse for and download many more puzzles from the Internet.  It also allows you to establish an account and compare your times with other solvers.  However  the FREE [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] app does nearly all of the same things.  (Crosswords Plus does not download your NY Times subscription puzzles automatically  although it makes it easy to download them daily it doesn't come with puzzles loaded  although it points you to free Internet sources and it doesn't have a feature for comparing scores with other solvers.)  In addition  [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] allows you to resize the grid  offers an alternate clues-only view  includes the usual hints options  and has navigational settings (skipping boxes  etc.) that are fully functional on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet.  Even if this CROSSWORDS app worked perfectly  I would still prefer [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]].  For this reason  and because of the high price and current Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet issues  I rate CROSSWORDS at 3 stars.",1
dried out,Good beef jerky  excellent lightly spiced  perfect for snacking. Great not-overly-spicy beef jerky. Perfect size for packing in my lunch bag for a mid afternoon snack. This is definitely one of my favorites. I did deduct a star because even though the flavor was great  I did find this pack a little on the dry side. I am going to order another package before month end and if I find the next package to be better  I will be adding to this review and changing it to a 5 star. My brother and nephew really love this jerky  too  and have been eating it for years  so I know it's got to be good!,0
light-handed treatments,Fantastic blend of complete menus  seasonality  and international flavors. My friend and James Beard Award-winning cookbook author Meike Peters recently released her latest cookbook “365: A Year of Everyday Cooking and Baking” and graciously sent a copy to me here in Japan  where I eagerly pored over the gorgeous food photography with its tantalizing  jewel-like salads.  Meike’s cooking is very much guided by the seasonal calendar  and in “365”  you’ll find a year’s worth of complete menus (including salads  soups  pasta  sandwiches  vegetables  seafood  meat and sweets) that make the most of seasonal produce  marrying them with a range of international influences including hearty German fare  Middle Eastern  and Mediterranean flavors and inspirations.  With the falling of the leaves and the arrivals of colder weather and flurries  the recipes featuring bright  sunny citrus are a welcome respite. Dishes like Winter Caprese with Blood Orange  Beet and Mozzarella di Bufala  Spaghetti with Ricotta  Orange and Crispy Sage Chocolate and Orange Pannetone  and Sicilian Orange Salad with Olive Oil  Marjoram  and Flaky Sea Salt are sure to stave off winter colds and chase the winter blahs away with the generous amount of vitamin C.  Others like Potato and apple-stuffed cabbage rolls with Walnut Butter and Gruyere  German beef  beet and potato stew  and Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Shallots and Apple  provide stick-to-your-ribs comfort.  The salads are a particular delight  including the rainbow potato salad with radishes  shallot vinaigrette and poached eggs  beet and apple carpaccio with pomegranate  raw asparagus and peach salad with orange blossom water and pecorino  and rainbow potato and cucumber salad with dill-pistachio pesto that will bring a splash of color (and flavor!) to overcast days.  Seasonal ingredients are given light-handed treatments that allow their individual textures and delicate flavors to shine  like fresh strawberries with saffron-vanilla sugar  watermelon caprese with mozzarella di bufala  basil and mint  and squash pasta with orange  maple and sage.  If you are someone who  like me  can never seem to come up with a complete menu  that’s one of the beauties of 365: You can also use the weekly menu planner to come up with a seasonal balanced meal by combining the various options for a given week.  I was absolutely intrigued by the idea of candied cherry tomatoes slow roasted and tossed with olive oil  confectioner’s sugar  and herbs  they dissolve into a silky confit that is the perfect complement for fresh pasta and tiny basil. Plus the leftover oil and tomatoes make a fantastic dipping oil!  Measurements and temperatures are provided in both US / Imperial and metric.  This has become one of my favorite cookbooks of the last several years highly recommended.,1
easy to clean,LOVE THESE-. So much better than what came with my keurig! Easy to use and clean. I like having several so I can get things ready for a couple days.,1
oily residue,Super oily and extremely sharp be careful.. At first I really didn't like how oily they were stacked together. I literally sliced my thumb open on the first one I was trying to take off the pile. I sliced my thumb again as I was trying to wipe the oily residue off before loading the rotary cutter. So use and clean with a lot of care. I was on a time crunch to complete a project and didn't have the time for the accidents my first attempt caused me. 😂  However  as long as you are careful and use cautious care they were a great buy for a little price. I will purchase these again when I finish using all that came in the pack.  I did ask a quilter friend that regularly uses her cuter and wheels why they needed to be so gross with oil. I was told that it has to do with how many come in the stack and to keep them very sharp while being tossed about during the moving  handling  and shipping. I don't know if her answer is the reason or not but it did make sense to me.  Just handle with extreme care always. Do not let young children use a rotary cutter. And don't let teens that can barely cut with scissors use either. (I'm not being funny with the teen part they will hurt themselves.) Take my word for it. I had teens helping with the project. Only responsible people should use these extremely helpful tool! This was the best tool (along with the self healing mat) I was ever gifted!,0
lots of action,Strong characters.. What a great book. I love reading the continuing story of Jordan and Eddie. This one really gets to the heart. Lots of action and when things get personal  both characters prove that they will do ANYTHING for each other and family even if it involves The Mob ! Definitely recommend this book to everyone !,1
high end gear reviews,Still not very good. I had a subscription to this magazine a few years ago. I let my sub run out because the magazine was not that good. I decided to give it another try and see if this magazine had improved. Nope  still the same old magazine. The gear reviews always seem to review the high end gear that only a small percentage of people can afford.   The articles are usually about hiking trails that are the top tier trails. PCT  AT  CDT  etc. How about some trails that are in different states that do not take MONTHS to finish! Some nice weekend trails would be awesome!! Seems like this magazine has always been biased towards the west coast. You know  there are many  many other trails in the US  across all 50 States!! Not just CA!  So  looks like this sub will be just like the first time I subbed. Going to let it expire. I can find better content on youtube anyways!,0
Great shampoo,Five Stars. Great shampoo that leaves my dogs clean and smelling good.,1
flavors didn’t come through as well,Too expensive for what you get. The sizes of the bars weren’t worth what was paid for. Some flavors didn’t come through as well as I’d expected.,0
softest skin,Softest skin I have had in years!. I have been using Pre de Provence soaps for years now. When I saw this one which includes shea butter  I couldn't wait to try it. After using this exclusively for almost a month  my skin feels  and looks  incredibly soft and smooth. I have terribly dry skin and always use a moisturizer after my shower  but now I have an additional aid to my dry skin in the shower. I love the fragrance  it is light and not overly strong. Pre de Provence makes quality products and I highly recommend them to everyone.,1
best one I've ever purchased,Very Nice. Great suction  best one I've ever purchased...,1
brings you back to when you first started watching the show,Nice. I really enjoyed doing this puzzle. The pieces fit together well and are not loose. The printing on the pieces are nice and clear So it makes it easier to see where fits in the picture. It brings you back to when you first started watching the show. This is a series of small scenes from the show and you can either put it together by scene or just the regular way. It does not have a poster. Good colors.,1
Seams are stitched straight,Does the job intended with style... For a price point under $20- this is a top that can actually do its job and provide ample coverage as a base layer.. But  the shirt is multifaceted and can also be used as a light pullover to lend a layer of protection from the sun..  if going casual- this even has the ability to stand alone on its own!  Material feels nice and soft with a small stretchable quality.. although a synthetic  this has a breathable lightness to it. Seams are stitched straight and on point- no loose threads. Ordered in light gray it has a small dime size “logo” imprinted on the chest (ours is in the same color as the shirt..) almost unnoticeable except for it’s silver sheen. Both the length in sleeve and torso- are comparable to U.S. sizing chart. A nice solid fit thru the body which is helped in part by the elastin stretch the fabric provides- it eliminates the appearance of a square boxier cut + feel for those with slender builds.. and yet  this has room to fit and forgive a bit without looking seer-sucking! (I included photos of fabric of close  logo  seams + shirts cut.. in case it helps!?)  For reference: My son is- 6’4”  187lb  33x36  active but  not super athletic build..18yr. caught between a man/boy body! This shirt nicely drapes his silhouette vs. hangs on his body type. *Note: neck opening is a tad wider at the shoulder points which is different then usual round opening (in womens style this is referenced as a “boat neck” Im not sure if it was just us who noticed this anomaly.. but  something to take notice of. Not a deal breaker just creates a slightly different finished look.  For an unknown brand this has the quality and ability to do its job at a solid price. An item that can find its way into your wardrobe in 3 if not all 4 seasons and has the quality to hold up as long. Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe!,1
long back length silicone scrubber,great self care set  fine quality  no issues  gift worthy items. Gift worthy set-comes with long back length silicone scrubber  a hand scrubber poof  a shower cap  and a set of hooks. All packed into a small box. Would make for a great stocking stuffer or as part of a themed self care gift.  I may pick up another set for this reason.  Everything is of good quality. I am extra impressed with the hand scrubber loofah/poof. It is rather robust. The longer silicone scrubber takes some getting used to. I have really come around to silicone scrubbers  as they just seem more hygienic to me. And even if you dont use bath wash on it (I often soap up my body  then run this over it)  it is lovely on the skin. Gentle  but effective. The shower cap is a nice addition. Use it in or out of shower.  No problems with this set. I think it is a great bundle of shower items. If I experience anything else  I will be back to update .,1
"""put them on a pair of Oakly's""",Chums original. Work exactly as they should.  I put them on a pair of Oakly's that had rubber temples and pulled my hair ALLLLL the time.  Sliding these on clipping off the ends of the chums  (I know.. not exactly the right application - but what the heck).  NO more hair pulling.  Love it.,0
easy to use,handy and so easy to use. I have IBS and my gastro doc has instructed me to do the FODMAP diet for 8 weeks.  Very  very frustrating diet.  So much you cannot eat that seems strange.  One thing is garlic.  Used in pretty much EVERYTHING you buy.  However  you ARE allowed to use garlic &#34infused&#34 oil... So  I decided to try this to help with the lack of salad dressing and on other foods.  I actually carry it in my purse because I eat out fairly often.  So I ask for some balsamic vinegar and use a couple of sprays of this garlic infused oil.  Quite tasty and easy.  So... you can make your own garlic infused oil  but it will only keep for about 1 week according to the recipe.  I wanted something less smelly to make (the smell will last in your kitchen for days making your own)  and something that would last a bit longer.  This oil is NOT for cooking... it is a &#34finishing&#34 spray... meaning you put it on food AFTER it is cooked or on salad or other cooked/raw foods. Taste is very personal  however  for me  it has a very strong garlic flavor.  Not overly so  but definitely there. It is satisfying.  Honestly  I may keep using it after my weird FODMAP diet days are over.  I was not able to find this anywhere locally so I am once again thankful to Amazon for bringing the world to my front door.  I always update with any useful info if that comes up.,1
kind of addicting,Fun to play. Kind of addicting. Fun,1
wire basket fit easily under my kitchen cabinets,Perfect!. This wire basket fit easily under my kitchen cabinets to hold vitamin bottles.,1
all about animals,Great for My Grandson!. My 9 year old grandson loves this magazine! He’s all about animals. I’ve subscribed for a second year!,1
makes crating far more comfortable,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
arrived quickly with prime,Baby Aspen Four-piece Gift Set. purchased for a beach themed baby shower and it was huge hit.... the grandma-to-be carried it around.  The &#34bucket&#34 is cardboard... the items are soft and very cute in person.  The color is sort of a bluish gray.  It arrived quickly (I have prime) with some other things I had ordered. i put it inside of a whale baby tub  along with a diaper bag set. This set made a lovely  unique gift.  Nice to give something there weren't several of.,1
limited number of ads,Moms favorite. Bought for mom. She has always read these and does not pick up at the food store. She loves the puzzle and limited number of ads. Shows up every week and reminds her I am thinking about her,1
perfect for my little one,Perfect for my little one. Great gift for my niece,1
find hope again,This is one of the best books I have read. This is one of the best books I have read. I have bought and given this as a gift to women of all ages. If you need to find hope again in dark situations this is a very good read.,1
value,great value. nice selection for the price,1
level of detail,Beautifully-crafted puzzle will provide hours of entertainment. I had the luck of visiting Portofino last October  and was instantly hooked on this 1 000-piece Ravensburger puzzle that perfectly captures the vibrant colors and Mediterranean atmosphere of the town. The framing of the photo is interesting as well  with several moored boats in the foreground and the harbor in the background. The level of detail in the high-resolution photo is amazing (the finished puzzle measures 27 X 20). The puzzle pieces are sturdy (unlike some cheaper puzzles I've assembled) and nonglare.  This is a fabulous challenge to have on hand for weekends or relaxation the large amount of blue in the water and sky make these more difficult sections to accomplish  but the end result is well worth the effort!,1
acoustic piano,Solid instrument that can help with not only time  but dynamics and listening skills. I received this as a free review sample. Since there are a number of very detailed reviews I am going to stick to how I use it as a drummer.  First  if you are practicing dynamics  this is an excellent tool. Of course it's designed to develop a sense of time  but it produces a beat in the 60 dB range at one meter. For a drummer this is somewhere in the P to PP range  so if you combine time keeping exercises with dynamics  this is an invaluable tool that I suspect most drummers will overlook because it's based on a design that is literally hundreds of years old. Trust me  this is effective. Moreover  since it is not incredibly loud it reinforces listening skills. I used this for a solid week in my practice room before writing this review and can make the claim that if you are a trained drummer this metronome has the potential to improve your dynamics  listening and time.  A nice thing is this is not as delicate as the old style metronomes upon which the design is based. It's not a toy and does need to be treated with care  but I owned a much older instrument that was temperamental and did not like being moved or handled much. This one is more robust.  Bottom line: if you are uncertain if this will be loud enough  download a copy of [[ASIN:B0054KJND6 Decibel-O-Meter Free]] and measure your own instrument's sound pressure level at one meter and determine if this metronome will be loud enough. For some instruments it may not be  but for many like an acoustic piano  guitar  etc. it will be. For folks like me this works for certain exercises like those I mentioned and it is a lot more pleasant than some of the electronic metronomes I have tried.,1
contacted seller never responded,Not Happy. this product lasted 3 months and died  i had to buy a new computer  this part was hard to find - contacted seller he/she never responded - dont bother wasting your money  buy a new computer !!,0
lid of detergent was not tightly on,Didn't receive all product. The purex detergent was in a loose bag in Amazon box. The lid of detergent was not tightly on therefore a quarter of the detergent spilt out! I'm not happy about that usually have no issues when buying detergent WHAT HAPPENED???,0
Visa Gift Card,Gift Card to Gift Card. Just reloaded my Amazon Gift Card from a Visa Gift Card. Its very easy to do.,1
NOT RECOMMENDED,Case for S8. SCREEN PROTECTOR ISN'T GOOD  CASE IS OK  BUT VERY CHEAPLY MADE  NOT RECCOMENDED,0
comfortable,These are cute and soft. These are comfortable  cute and fit as expected.  They washed well and didn't fade.  They are a little on the thin side  but still a nice set of pajamas.,1
look,Love. This kimono thing looks really awesome. I really enjoyed the look of it. Super light  so it is great for warmer weather. It does come a little past my calves  but not quite to my ankles.,1
love the tie waist and ribbed texture,Comfortable. Great quality set. Perfect for working out or lounging. Love the color and thickness of the material. I normally wear a small or medium and the medium fit perfectly. Love the tie waist and ribbed texture.,1
favorite feature is the lighting,Fast & Efficient. Using this keyboard for the first time is like driving a brand new car after owning a clunker. The slightest touch on the gas makes you go speeding down the road. The keys are exceedingly responsive. The layout is thoughtful and ergonomic. I find the lighting to be my favorite feature. I HIGHLY recommend this keyboard for avid gamers.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier.,1
generous supply of good-quality loops,Great for new users  lousy for upgraders. In the past I have used several versions of Magix Music Maker  including version 7  2005  and 10. Each has been a steady progression of improvement and capability  so I was quite eager to see how much new stuff was added when I upgraded from version 10 to version 14. I was surprised not so much by the new capabilities but by how much has been removed.  The overall application is similar to Sony Acid or even Audacity - it is a loop-based music composition and production tool. The main production board allows for up to 96 tracks  which is a generous amount and should be plenty for all but the most complex and lengthy of tracks. There are a large number of production tools that allow for all manner of effects and edits  giving a near limitless supply of tweaks and edits that can be made to a track.  The new interface (as compared to version 10 which is my reference point) is sleek and user friendly  although the learning curve for an application of this type is understandably steep. Most functions are relatively straightforward  but some do require a jaunt through the user manual which is included in PDF form in the installation directory.  There is a generous supply of good-quality loops  though users of previous versions have seen some of these in the past. For a new user  though  there's a lot to choose from.  The VSTi interface is vastly improved and updated  making it not only a lot more user friendly but a lot more stable too. A new synth is included  the Vita. This supposedly take place of the guitar and grand piano synths  though I have not worked enough with it to replicate those sounds. I have monkeyed with it enough to make some interesting sounds  though  and overall I think it's a good synth.  Magix has done a nice job of better integrating their tools  which is a step forward. The only problem there is that sometimes users of previous versions may struggle to find some of the tools they want or need. Such is the case with me  though I found most of what I sought. Most - not all. This is where I noticed something unpleasant.  Music Maker 10 came with a wonderful tool called the Music Editor  which is a waveform editor with some other useful functions. I used this more than Music Maker itself. I was anxious to see how it had changed and when I looked for it I could not find it. What I did find  in the help file  was an occasional reference to it including a menu selection for locating it. The selection did not exist. After digging deeper I found that Magix stripped out the Music Editor and it is available as an upgrade to the Producer Edition - which you can ONLY get through the Magix website. Another $30 and you can have what used to be included.  Also gone are the Copper synth and the Silver synth. I used to use the Copper quite frequently and that one will be missed. I do not understand why it was removed  having been in the application for many iterations.  For a new user  Music Maker 14 packs a lot of goodies into the package and is a great starting point. For upgraders  though  it is a disappointment  with the smell of being a play for additional fees (much like activating the MP3 plug-in). This will be my last Magix purchase  based on the change in packaging and pricing  though I like the program itself. Hopefully Magix will realize that alienating long-standing customers is a poor strategy and will include the missing pieces in the regular edition again.,1
pages had mold and mildew,Watch out when ordering used items.. I ordered this stamping book as used/condition good.  Sadly nothing about it was good.  Thirty pages has what appeared was mold and mildew  but the worst part was the last section of the book the pages and cover completely stuck together.  It looks like the book was left in the rain and got saturated and left to dry because you couldn’t even pry the pages apart.  It was totally worthless.  Sad  very sad.,0
complexity,Nice camera but way overpriced. Let me start by stating that I received this camera as part of the Vine program. I have used it for almost 2 months now exclusively and this review is based on this. I also own a Canon Rebel (which I used for real photographic ventures like special events  concerts and travel) and a Sony Cyber-shot (which I had be using for more 'quickie' picture taking as it is smaller and I can fit it in my pocket).  Although I found the picture quality far superior with the Fujifilm XF1 than the Sony  the complexity of the Fujifilm along with the high price tag  make it seem like it should be comparable to what I paid for the Rebel. To be honest  the picture quality and the flexibility/lenses of the Rebel far outweigh the Fujifilm XF1. The way I look at it  the XF1 is a really nice point and shoot. If you are looking for a quality  sleek  stylish camera which is a step above the other pocket sized cameras (especially when it comes to low-light picture capability)  and you have several $100 to spend  then the investment may be worth it for you. I just think that if you are a true photographer and want to take quality pictures in the $500 price range  then go for an entry level DSLR which will give you the flexibility of interchanging lenses. I am rating this as a 4 star because  honestly  it's a great camera. It's the price  and what you get for it  that has me shaving one star off the rating.,0
Whole Foods,LOTS OF ALLERGIES AND BEST Essential Oils I Ever Bought.. I bought this set last June and just opened it now. The fact that the oils are SO fresh upon opening nine months later says a lot.  A few things you have to understand:  The negative review about allergy upon skin contact is only ONE case. As someone with a ton of skin sensitivities and contact dermatitis  I also got a tiny bit itchy with mixing the orange  lemongrass and rosemary onto my skin but THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. These are 100% essential oil  NOT mixed with any kind of carrier. If you go to Whole Foods and buy one of the AuraCacia oils  many are mixed with jojoba oil so that they are easier on skin. Yes  they also have a line of 100% essential oils but these are a much better value. These are FULL POTENCY and VOLATILE which means yes  they *can* burn skin and SHOULD NOT be used on or around pets (do research as I know some oils are poisonous to cats). Any full potency oil can be extremely toxic to children if ingested. If you are making a batch of homemade lotion  DIY sanitizers or whatever else  you add like 4-5 drops for every CUP of product. More than that is going to be way too much. That said  this is actually a REALLY great value for this entire set. And non-GMO  Organic?!!! AMAZING.,1

large sized bows,Great for Pink Out Game!. Perfect for my daughter and her friends for the Pink Out football game this weekend. They are large sized bows and great for high school girls. The pony tail band is secured with glue and a layer of ribbon to hold it in place. They are sturdy and well made. I would definitely consider ordering more hair bows from this seller in the future.,1
surprisingly work,Surprisingly this works well to remove my cream eye make-up. I tried many different make-up remover products and have always been disappointed because they never remove what they say it will remove and I have to use a ton of solution or wipes. However  these surprisingly work. I used this to remove cream eyeshadow and it did a wonderful job. In addition  my lids felt moisturized. Note each cloth is infused with Vitamin E and Aloe.  There are 10 (I received 11) individually wrapped disposable cloths in each package. They come loosely packaged in an envelope  so I have to put them in a zip lock bag to store.  At the current price of 9.50 ($10 minus 5%)  it comes to $.95 cents per remover cloth. I certainly would not make a steady diet of these since they are expensive  but they are perfect for that once-in-awhile situation where one needs to remove their make-up without soap and water. ,1
gets cold in the winter,gutter stops. These are cute.. however... they don't really work like the photo shows... unless you have a a torrent of water flowing out of your gutters! Haha.. but they are a cuter end to the gutter than just the end of the gutter pipe.  The back of the gnome is rather large... and a bit awkward to fit exactly.  It more like 'rests' on the bottom of the pipe.  I had to reinforce it with some rocks I had because my pipe didn't come all the way down to the ground.  All in all  it is cute and the water does sort of dribble out  the way it does out of your drain pipe  out of the mouth of the giant frog.  I purchased two of them for pipes that are visible in the front of the house.  They arrived quickly and well packed.  They are molded plastic like material - so no rust. Will last a fairly long time considering you don't throw them around or step on them.  I live right on the Oregon coast front - so it gets cold in the winter - we'll see how they do.,1
fantastic to propose to someone,Beautiful ring box. This is a beautiful ring box that will be fantastic to propose to someone. I liked it so much  I got another. The box is wood and it is held together with a magnet. The box is just expensive looking and can be used as a ring box forever. These boxes are hand made too. Quality all around.,1
country,little bit of rock  a little bit of country and a little bit of rap. it is funny  how within one song you can get a real mix of composition!  for a new comer  she has a great voice and like a review before  she definately has a bit of carrie underwood  a bit of pussycat  and a little bit of Wyonna too.  The lyrics are definately more country orientated.  Strong voice  great music beat and many of the songs  I couldnt help tapping my feet and I am going to incorporate many of songs in my personal spinning exercise program.  Definately a good album to play in an open car!,1
special boxes and beautiful containers,my favorite gift i bought for me. Craftsmanship superb and love the fact its handmade.  I have lots of jewelry.  It sets in special boxes and beautiful containers.  This i want to wear all the time.  I just ordered the mustard seed pendant.  I also make my own jewlery.  Wish i had made it!,1
part of my daily skincare routine,I Couldn’t Be More Impressed! 💖. I absolutely love this dual-headed face roller!! It’s gorgeously colored  easy to hold  attractively packaged  and competitively priced. I especially love using it after I’ve cleansed my skin and applied moisturizer  right before I start putting on my makeup. It instantly helps depuff my skin  and it seems to enhance the smooth coverage of every cream and foundation I use immediately afterwards. It has definitely become part of my daily skincare routine  and the aluminum alloy rollers are super smooth and manage to apply the perfect amount of weighted pressure!,1
tool,Great Set!. A few weeks ago  my children and I started crafting with resin. One of our friends saw our initial pieces and requested an initial. Well  we needed a new mold then! This is a great mold that has all of the letters A-Z and digits 0-9. The molds aren't too shallow so the finished letters are a good thickness. The set also comes with some fun accessories such as the tassels and key rings. There's also some glitter and a tool for putting the holes in to the finished letters. I ended up ordering some different key rings  because I wanted clips so we could clip our initials to our bags if we wanted. Overall  this is a fun set to have.,0
saves potential damage to my furniture,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
one wand toy included each month,Amazing customer service and cats are obsessed.. I recommend the “without treats” subscription as you get an extra toy. So far my cats are obsessed with at least one toy from each box we’ve received. The others are still appreciated. They're always based around a cool theme and there is one wand toy included each month. At least a couple are manufactured in the US (maybe handmade?). They seem pretty high-quality overall. I’ve gotten two boxes so far and love that meowbox offers a bimonthly subscription through the website. Meowbox also has amazing customer service.,1
compartments open easily,Perfect for the senior in your life!. I love this pill holder. I got it for my mom who is in her 90's now and I am so glad I did. It is a larger size  allows me to put out her medication by am/pm and the dates are very large and easy for her to read. The compartments open easily and I find it so much easier for her to handle being sure she gets all the medicine she needs and the time she needs it. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a great pill organizer!,1

top 50 reviewer,The dept of sensitive crimes. Purchased this for my 83 year old Mom  she loves the author.  This is a series in case you're interested in checking into it.  I think it is actually #1 of 3 (?).  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - nearly 6 000 reviews posted  viewed over 50 000 times  and over 24 000 likes.,1
grounds clogging the filter,French Press works better. I was so excited to use this for cold brew since I love so many OXO products  but this was a disappointment. I’ve been making cold brew in a French press until now  and I have been pleased with the results  but since it requires hands on filtering  I thought this OXO system would simplify the filtering and allow the machine to do most of the work. Wrong. With a French Press  once the coffee has brewed  I can press the coffee and separate most of the grounds from the cold brew. Then I slowly pour it out into a mesh filter lined with a paper filter and wait for it to slowly seep through. I have to change the paper filter half way through before pouring the second half. With this OXO system  you are supposed to be able to flip the switch and the cold brew will drip down in to the glass carafe below. But the grounds kept clogging the filter and then absolutely no liquid could get through. (I will also note that I have a quality conical burr grinder  so the grind should not be an issue.) I had to stand over it for about 15 min scraping the grounds to the side or scooping spoonfuls of grounds out of the brewing container. After 15 minutes of this  we were left with roughly 2/3 of the volume of cold brew we would have gotten from the same recipe in a French press. The reduced volume was partially due to me scooping grounds out of the way and throwing them in the sink  and partially because there was no way to effectively press the liquid out of the grounds. Also the taste was inferior. Again probably because the most concentrated cold brew couldn’t be pressed out of the grounds. Overall the taste was nowhere as good and the process was more cumbersome than a French press. I wish I loved this machine  but on the plus side  it’s one less thing to sit on my counter and take up more space in the fridge.,0

lightweight grilling projects,"Convenient. These disposable grills are awesome for a quick  easy bbq.  They are perfect for ""precooked"" like hotdogs/brats.  If you want to grill something raw  chicken/beef  I find a piece of foil over the top of cooking food is helpful to focus the heat.  I love that the ""charcoal"" is all natural and no lighter fluid is necessary. I use the smaller size when it's just me. The larger size cooked 8 hotdogs and 4 brats easily (space).  I also like the sanitary aspect of using these... no grill to clean or grilling on a surface that might not be cleaned well. NOTE:  Beware of using the wire brushes on your grill - the metal brissles can be ingested and puncture your intestines - which is life threatening not to mention painful!  When using a regular grill  once the grates have cooled you can soak the grill grates in garbage sack with a little detergent. Next day  hose them off. Yeah  it's a little more of a hassle  but NO metal brissles to ingest. All in all  these disposable grills are really meant for ""lightweight"" grilling projects. I just like the additional positive aspects of using them  like the cleanliness aspect. Hope this info helps!",1

comfortable,Comfortable. Great quality set. Perfect for working out or lounging. Love the color and thickness of the material. I normally wear a small or medium and the medium fit perfectly. Love the tie waist and ribbed texture.,1
lightweight moisturizer,Lightweight moisturizer absorbs rapidly leaves skin moderately hydrated smells lemony. Even though this is baby lotion  I got this for me. This moisturizer is lightweight  slightly creamy  absorbs rapidly  and leaves my skin moderately hydrated. Since it is lightweight  it is a perfect summer lotion. To my senses  it has a mild lemony fragrance even though that is not listed in the ingredients. This is made of all plant-based ingredients (see photo). The current price of $16 is competitive but pricey for this 6.7 ounce tube.,1
cushion my heel,Superb socks with extra cushioning stays in place while walking are also warm. I first bought a pair of these socks at REI for $27 and loved them. I wanted another color of the same sock so I purchased these. These socks are wonderful. They are slightly thick  sturdy  snug but not too tight  and feel fabulous on. They cushion my heel and bottom of foot and they do not move around like other socks  which helps prevent blisters. I walk a lot and these socks stay put even on a two-hour walk. I LOVE THEM.  One caveat  however. These socks must be an older model of the same sock that I purchased at REI. The reason I say that is because compared to the original sock I purchased  they are about two inches shorter. I then did some research and found a comparison chart for two of the same mountaineering socks by the same name. The only difference between the two models is that there's a slightly different fabric combination and it is not listed as quick drying.  To me both socks feel the same. I also ordered three more pairs. I now own five pairs of these socks and they are WONDERFUL! In fact  I love them so much that I ordered this [[ASIN:B01F47N7XK men's pair]] for my boyfriend. My boyfriend loves them as well. He wears them to bed.,1
composers,Good Addition to Repertory. A wide variety of classical music and composers.  Mostly intermediate level.,1
romance and hijinks with the high-spirited German expat Auntie Poldi,I greatly enjoyed Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions. As a huge fan of the inspector Montalbano series and other international detective stories  I greatly enjoyed Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions.  The pacing keeps you on the edge of your seat  and  although some elements require you to seriously suspend credibility  overall this is a highly entertaining romp.  Beautiful Sicily is the real star here   and you’ll find plenty of romance and hijinks with the high-spirited German expat Auntie Poldi  who has a few tricks up her fashionable sleeve  and who has set her sights on hunky police detective Vito Montana  and the tension between the two simmers and sizzles for much of the book.  The daughter of a German police detective  Poldi possesses great instincts and a knack for sleuththing that has her trying to find a killer involved with the mafia.  I can’t wait to read more of her adventures in the second book Fruits of the Lord.,1

the adjunct to my selections of books to read,"Ahhhh ... my favorite magazine. I'm not an archaeologist. If I was born redundantly wealthy I think that I might have been one.  Archaeology is my ""stop everything and read it on the day it arrives"" magazine. I've been a subscriber for years. I read EVERY article. As a reader of archaeology and paleontology tomes  this magazine is the adjunct to my selections of books to read. My wife and I have planned vacations around Archaeology's articles.  I've detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites.  During a cross country moving event 7 years ago  I let the subscription expire for lack of new address. Someone from Archaeology  not a telemarketer for sure  called me and said that I had been such a long term customer that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew ... was it something about the magazine quality? The voice on the other end was just so dang disappointed as she pleaded for feedback that it was stunning enough for me to remember 7 years later. The magazine must be read by a small but dedicated subscriber base and I think the magazine staff themselves makes the calls.  My only complaint is that it only prints every 2 months. If archaeology is among your interests  you would entertain your fancies with a subscription.",1
ONE PIECE,You get ONE PIECE. Important to realize. Well  I am not sure why someone would want this particular hair piece. It is ok  and the hair feels very slick. But you only get ONE piece  so it would not be enough for most hairstyles.  I misplaced my photos  but will add them when I find them. It is just super important to realize you do not get a whole hairpiece  but just one small clip's worth of hair. To look like the vendor photo  you would need to buy 10-12 of these.,0
R&B,Britain does it again!. What started out as a uniquely American genre  that of blues  soul  and gospel  has somehow managed to become the creative property of Britain ... ever since the decline of classic Motown  Britain has been churning out an amazingly talented bunch of blue-eyed soul singers and blues musicians. One of the more recent additions is James Hunter  who first burst onto the scene under the stage name Howlin' Wilf in the 1980s ([[ASIN:B000HOJNI4 Cry Wilf!]]). His several solo recordings are strongly influenced by R&B  early rock and roll  and soul. His 1994 debut Believe What I Say includes guest performances by Van Morrison (Hunter also appeared on several of Van's albums during the '90s and was part of Morrison's Rhythm & Blues Revue).  Believe What I Say opens with the jivin' Two Can Play  with its sassy staccato sax riffs punctuating this tale of infidelity. Hunter's smooth  sensual update of torch song The Very Thought Of You comes off as more late-night smoky jazz  with a delivery that Ray Charles would be proud of. Turn On Your Love Light features a smokin' duet with Van Morrison.  One of the few covers is Ray Charles' Hallelujah I Love Her So. Compared to Charles' original  which leaned towards Big Band brassy  Hunter's backing saxes sound the same on every track  and I felt the instrumentals lacking punch in the first half  but the bridge (with guitar) redeems the song and gospel feeling creeps in toward the finale.  Out of Sight is a tight soul ditty that pays homage to James Brown with its knockout brass/drum punches. Hear Me Calling has some hand-waving gospel vibes going  complete with call-and-response chorus.  The majority of the songs sound like they could have come off the radio from the mid-'50s to late '60s. They're pleasant enough  but the sameness of the backing detracts from the potential to differentiate between tracks. Hunter's writing chops create songs that feel authentically retro. His singing voice combines elements of Ray Charles and Sam Cooke  and his guitar shows heavy influence from Chuck Berry and legendary blues guitarists such as B.B. King.  Hunter has continued to polish his sound on his subsequent solo releases [[ASIN:B0000259AM Kick It Around]] and [[ASIN:B000E1NX1S People Gonna Talk]]  but it's enjoyable to hear his first solo work after his turn with Howlin' Wilf and the Vee-Jays. He's one of the most authentic of the current crop of blue-eyed soul artists  and really inhabits that long-lost R&B/soul/blues era as if it were only yesterday instead of decades ago.,1
brightness,surge protector with usb ports. Usually surge protectors have 6 plugins... this one has five... I missed the extra space was taken with usb charger ports.  It is bright white.  The dimensions and cord length were accurate.  I would personally would have preferred the six regular plugs... but I can't knock stars for me missing the details.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful  nor do I shy away from answering comments/questions.  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.  My purchases are VERIFIED  FULL price and 100% independent.  As are my reviews!  They are fully my opinion  which could differ from yours - and that's ok.  Happy shopping!,0

price is awesome,Presto great laundry detergent (use so much less) Essential oils too. I was at first sight kind of disappointed I for some reason thought it was going to be larger bottles. I then realized how concentrated Presto was. I was surprised to find out just how small of amount you needed to use. Presto does awesome cleaning getting the stains out. The fact it use essential oils is even better. The smell is great but I'm more of a fresh linen person. I do recommend it price is awesome because you don't use as much.,1
box looked like it had previous shipping labels peeled off,"Mixed blessing  but so far  so good. I looked at probably 20 portable ice makers before choosing this one. Price was a factor  but so was customer input from reviews. It seemed like many of the other models were the exact same machine with a different company label stuck on them  and their reviews were so varied  it seemed like you either got a lemon or a good one.  Also  all the others opened at the top and vented on the side. For some reason  I thought this one would work better in our area  with the drawer pulling out at the front  and I THOUGHT the vent would be at the side like all the other machines.  My purpose in buying this is not for a bar or camper  like many people. I am partially disabled  and can't get downstairs to the kitchen on any sort of regular basis. I really wanted to be able to have ice when I wanted some  especially with the heat of summer rolling in very  very soon. I don't like room temperature drinks  esp water or tea  so I'd found myself drinking Pepsi almost exclusively  the only thing I could stand at room temp. That needed to stop!  So  I ended up buying this one  but the experience was not a pleasant one. I love my Amazon prime dearly  but they really botched this one. The shipping dates got moved around even after I paid extra for one-day shipping  and ended up with this being delivered on a totally different day  when I was the only one home and could not come to the door. (Note that Amazon did end up giving me a small credit on my acct to try to make up for the shipping problem  even though it did not solve my problem.) I always chat with the UPS guys through the upstairs window  so they left it for me anyway. I knew my son would be home very shortly after  and he was. He brought the box up  and I have to say that I am almost positive I got a customer return. The box looked like it had previous shipping labels peeled off of it. The box was beat up  torn  and had a crushed in spot on the side. Our UPS guys are really great  so I think it was shipped out from Day One looking like that - who in the warehouses think customers really want something that looks that bad?! (And yes  I know this is a product review section  and I can file shipping problems elsewhere  and I will. Just giving folks a heads-up of how it is shipped and what I received.) This is shipped in its original mfg box with tie cords on it  there is no other packaging other than what the mfg sends it out with - no Amazon packaging whatsoever. Strike One.  I opened the box  not sure of what I would find. It only has two big strips of styrofoam on the sides to hold it. Ours indeed had a dent in the side  and one of the back exhaust fans had cracked plastic. Not a crisis  but at this price  I really do expect a brand new item in great condition! Strike Two.  SMELLS/TASTE: I read a lot of reviews that talk about the plastic smell and/or taste in the cubes  and how it didn't seem to want to fire up well. IF someone reads the directions (not everyone likes to do that!)  you'd see it says to make sure the machine sits for at least an hour to allow the coolant to properly settle back into place after you unpack it. This particular model also says to run a bleach solution through it to help clean it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT!! The machine indeed smells heavily of plastic. Anyone who has had a relay switch burn out on an item knows what smell I am talking about - sort of like melting plastic. Ugh. However  having read plenty about portable ice makers before buying one  I knew that either vinegar or lemon juice would also work just fine. I chose to go with one that was ingestible  rather than bleach!! We did the lemon juice  and ran an entire cycle of cubes through it with the lemon/water. (Toss the ice please!) I then ran two loads (all the cubes a full water tank would make) through it of plain water. AFTER those cycles  I wiped it out again and ran regular water through it to try making cubes we'd use. We had no problems at all with any funny tastes in our ice this way. If you have a bad quality of tap water though  I'd suggest using either bottled  filtered or distilled water. It is only natural that your cubes will not taste better than your tap water. Ours is okay  so we're good that way. I would have bought a water filter (like a Brita) if that had not been the case. No lemony taste  no plastic taste  no gross tastes or odors at all. (Remember  I really do NOT recommend using bleach like the mfg suggests. While I understand the germ-killing properties of the bleach  I really don't want to ingest any of it. I would also think it would be much more caustic to the plastic parts and hoses of the machine  wearing them out sooner. Stick with lemon juice.) It did smell like plastic out the exhaust fan for quite a while  but it is fading away.  NOISE: Of course it is going to make noise. This has a compressor  and it will be making some noise. However  I've found that at its noisiest part of the cycle  it is no different than a microwave oven running  sometimes a little quieter.The ice cubes dumping make me jump a little bit  at least at first  but then again I am easily startled. Made the cats jump too! LOL! However  they are pretty much used to it now  even if they eyeball it suspiciously while it is running.  I have to say that I haven't stopped to time an actual cycle to make the ice. I've tried the small  medium and large cubes though. They are all gumdrop-shaped (or like the Dots candy at the movies)  with a hole in the middle of the bottom. It didn't seem to take very long though. The small ones were a little too small for my uses  but would be good for smaller drink glasses. I use a [[ASIN:B003X46LHG Bubba Brands Keg 52 Oz Mug Slate Gray]] to hold the ice at the moment  and love it. If you use the medium size  you can get the first batch in around 10 minutes  but the other batches do seem to take longer for some reason. It has also seemed to get ""stuck"" where it runs and runs  with nothing going on. I turn it off  let it sit a minute and push start again  and off it goes. I am not sure if it is just my machine with the dents from rough handling  or if all of this model is like that.  I was disappointed that this unit does not exhaust on the side  reason being where I planned to locate it  on a table behind my bed! It would vent towards my pillow  which is just not gonna happen. So  I have it turned sideways so it will vent towards the doorway. It makes opening the ice drawer more awkward  and makes me wish I'd tried one of the top-opening models now. There wasn't anything in the photos and such to suggest that this unit would be different than most of the other portable ice makers. It is. I'll post photos at a later date.  This model's book also suggests plugging the machine in to a GFI outlet  or grounded plug that will shut off if it senses dampness. I don't have one in the bedroom  and currently am using a heavy-duty  three-prong extension cord and plugging it in in the bathroom  where we do have a GFI plug. Not ideal  but better than trying to get a special outlet installed in a rented bedroom.  The scoop is VERY tiny. It works best to scoop towards you  so you don't send ice cubes back into the machine. The measuring cup works well for pouring  because you have a small reservoir to fill  and you have to go over a small clear rubber ""wall"" that helps to hold the drawer in place and hold temperatures.  Any unused ice does indeed melt back into the reservoir and is recycled back into cubes. Once I have enough ice for anyone who wants it  I turn it off rather than let it continually cycle. I also unplug it in the evenings when I go to bed for the night  since I'm the only one who can't go downstairs for ice if they want it. I hope that saves on the ""vampire electricity"" of the unit. Note that this is not a refrigerated ice maker  and the unused ice WILL melt. Many people complained about ice cubes stuck together - I've only experienced that when getting ice that has been done for an hour or so (it keeps the ice for at least an hour after the last cycle at this point) - otherwise  the cubes are all loose and easy to use. If you try to take the ice drawer all the way out after leaving the ice sit for a while  it WILL leak water on you - the water is simply the ice melting back and going through the drain holes that let it run back into the reservoir. (Nope - I didn't even think about the drainage holes when I pulled the drawer out the first time  and had water on the table and the floor. That was my fault though.)  For now  I am mostly happy with it. I cannot tell you how nice it is to have ice when I want it  instead of waiting for someone to get home in the evening and get me some! It was an expensive luxury though  and one I really thought long and hard about getting since I can no longer work. I'm thinking I really want to keep it. The cosmetic issues were VERY annoying  since I paid for a new machine  not a used one  but in this case  I blame Amazon for sending this out with a crushed box from the get-go. I would not have accepted it  had I been able to get to the door and saw it. Again - for some reason  this was the most problematic purchase I've ever had in all my time on Amazon.  This machine has not reached Strike Three yet  but you can be sure I'll come back and update my review should that happen. For now  I'll keep running it  and see how it seems to work  dents  cracked exhaust grid and all. (The dents are even more annoying  because it has a stainless steel appearance. It shows readily. It was more of a hassle to return it than to just keep it  as long as it continues to work.)  UPDATE June 29  2012: Well  I've had this machine for a little over a month now. Is it perfect? Nope. Does it make ice? Yep. Does it make a little noise?  Yep  but not unbearable. So far  the broken parts do not seem to be affecting the basic function of the machine. While I still have not literally timed the cube cycle (I have good intentions  but seems like there's always something better to do than watch the clock for ice cubes to drop! Ha!)  I have found the medium cubes to be the most useful. In fact  I often use an empty Sobe Lifewater bottle to make quick tea (loving the new tea from Lipton with the honey in it)  and the medium cubes fit in this bottle perfectly. So  that might give folks a better idea about the size of the medium cube. The difference in the sizes are basically more (or less) layers of ice on the cubes. The small ones are still too big for a basic 16.9 oz water bottle  and melt too fast when I shake up my tea. The first batch of the day takes around 10 minutes  but for some reason  they are skinnier than the normal mediums. The machine makes additional batches inbetween 10-15 minutes. Around 2 or 2-1/2 of the water cup it comes with to fill the reservoir to maximum. That will fill the ice bin to the top with medium cubes.  At this point  I increased my stars by one  because of the function of the machine  and it being willing to do what I ""hired"" it to do - keep me in cold drinks. Strike three has not yet happened  and I hope it doesn't! Enjoy!",1
thicker/wider band,Excellent Celtic Knot Band. I purchased another ring from this seller and was very pleased with it and was looking for something else in the Celtic design.

amazing customer service,Amazing customer service and cats are obsessed.. I recommend the “without treats” subscription as you get an extra toy. So far my cats are obsessed with at least one toy from each box we’ve received. The others are still appreciated. They're always based around a cool theme and there is one wand toy included each month. At least a couple are manufactured in the US (maybe handmade?). They seem pretty high-quality overall. I’ve gotten two boxes so far and love that meowbox offers a bimonthly subscription through the website. Meowbox also has amazing customer service.,1

They are all gumdrop-shaped (or like the Dots candy at the movies)  with a hole in the middle of the bottom. It didn't seem to take very long though. The small ones were a little too small for my uses  but would be good for smaller drink glasses. I use a [[ASIN:B003X46LHG Bubba Brands Keg 52 Oz Mug Slate Gray]] to hold the ice at the moment  and love it. If you use the medium size  you can get the first batch in around 10 minutes  but the other batches do seem to take longer for some reason. It has also seemed to get ""stuck"" where it runs and runs  with nothing going on. I turn it off  let it sit a minute and push start again  and off it goes. I am not sure if it is just my machine with the dents from rough handling  or if all of this model is like that.  I was disappointed that this unit does not exhaust on the side  reason being where I planned to locate it  on a table behind my bed! It would vent towards my pillow  which is just not gonna happen. So  I have it turned sideways so it will vent towards the doorway. It makes opening the ice drawer more awkward  and makes me wish I'd tried one of the top-opening models now. There wasn't anything in the photos and such to suggest that this unit would be different than most of the other portable ice makers. It is. I'll post photos at a later date.  This model's book also suggests plugging the machine in to a GFI outlet  or grounded plug that will shut off if it senses dampness. I don't have one in the bedroom  and currently am using a heavy-duty  three-prong extension cord and plugging it in in the bathroom  where we do have a GFI plug. Not ideal  but better than trying to get a special outlet installed in a rented bedroom.  The scoop is VERY tiny. It works best to scoop towards you  so you don't send ice cubes back into the machine. The measuring cup works well for pouring  because you have a small reservoir to fill  and you have to go over a small clear rubber ""wall"" that helps to hold the drawer in place and hold temperatures.  Any unused ice does indeed melt back into the reservoir and is recycled back into cubes. Once I have enough ice for anyone who wants it  I turn it off rather than let it continually cycle. I also unplug it in the evenings when I go to bed for the night  since I'm the only one who can't go downstairs for ice if they want it. I hope that saves on the ""vampire electricity"" of the unit. Note that this is not a refrigerated ice maker  and the unused ice WILL melt. Many people complained about ice cubes stuck together - I've only experienced that when getting ice that has been done for an hour or so (it keeps the ice for at least an hour after the last cycle at this point) - otherwise  the cubes are all loose and easy to use. If you try to take the ice drawer all the way out after leaving the ice sit for a while  it WILL leak water on you - the water is simply the ice melting back and going through the drain holes that let it run back into the reservoir. (Nope - I didn't even think about the drainage holes when I pulled the drawer out the first time  and had water on the table and the floor. That was my fault though.)  For now  I am mostly happy with it. I cannot tell you how nice it is to have ice when I want it  instead of waiting for someone to get home in the evening and get me some! It was an expensive luxury though  and one I really thought long and hard about getting since I can no longer work. I'm thinking I really want to keep it. The cosmetic issues were VERY annoying  since I paid for a new machine  not a used one  but in this case  I blame Amazon for sending this out with a crushed box from the get-go. I would not have accepted it  had I been able to get to the door and saw it. Again - for some reason  this was the most problematic purchase I've ever had in all my time on Amazon.  This machine has not reached Strike Three yet  but you can be sure I'll come back and update my review should that happen. For now  I'll keep running it  and see how it seems to work  dents  cracked exhaust grid and all. (The dents are even more annoying  because it has a stainless steel appearance. It shows readily. It was more of a hassle to return it than to just keep it  as long as it continues to work.)  UPDATE June 29  2012: Well  I've had this machine for a little over a month now. Is it perfect? Nope. Does it make ice? Yep. Does it make a little noise?  Yep  but not unbearable. So far  the broken parts do not seem to be affecting the basic function of the machine. While I still have not literally timed the cube cycle (I have good intentions  but seems like there's always something better to do than watch the clock for ice cubes to drop! Ha!)  I have found the medium cubes to be the most useful. In fact  I often use an empty Sobe Lifewater bottle to make quick tea (loving the new tea from Lipton with the honey in it)  and the medium cubes fit in this bottle perfectly. So  that might give folks a better idea about the size of the medium cube. The difference in the sizes are basically more (or less) layers of ice on the cubes. The small ones are still too big for a basic 16.9 oz water bottle  and melt too fast when I shake up my tea. The first batch of the day takes around 10 minutes  but for some reason  they are skinnier than the normal mediums. The machine makes additional batches inbetween 10-15 minutes. Around 2 or 2-1/2 of the water cup it comes with to fill the reservoir to maximum. That will fill the ice bin to the top with medium cubes.  At this point  I increased my stars by one  because of the function of the machine  and it being willing to do what I ""hired"" it to do - keep me in cold drinks. Strike three has not yet happened  and I hope it doesn't! Enjoy!",0
difficult for the dog to remove,These work just great. Snug fit and difficult for the dog to .... I dogwatch my son's male dog every few months  and he has marked the whole house. The new rule is  male visitors must wear belly bands. These work just great. Snug fit and difficult for the dog to remove.,1
gate is very sturdy,Rusted poles and not an easy assembly but sturdy. The gate serves its purpose and it's very sturdy once it's up but the assembly wasn't easy. Getting the white poles to in place while was a pain. Also my poles arrived rusted. Not cool. It's an aight product.,1
hands protect,Great set of dish washing gloves!. This gloves are perfect for dish washing or other household cleaning duties. They keep your hands protect nicely during all these duties we love so dearly  not. They are a good quality product that should stand up the test of time quite nicely  only time will tell. These gloves come with a cotton flocking that makes wearing them nice and comfortable and absorbs your sweat to some degree. Getting a pair of these for $10 is very good so I can recommend purchasing these for sure!,1
felt amazing,Nice heel cushions  just be sure you are not too active with your feet.. I have been looking for heel cushions for a while now. I walk every morning (upwards of 5 miles) and my heels typically are sore almost every day. I will say that upon inserting these in my sneakers and then putting them on  my feet felt amazing. I immediately could tell the difference in my gait. I had to deduct one star though because after wearing them and walking for upwards of an hour I felt the cushions had shifted. It became uncomfortable for the remainder of my walk. I was wondering if this was just a lark and used them as well the second day  this time using some packing tape rolled to assist in securing them in place in my sneakers. Although this did seem to solve the movement  I didn't feel I should have to adjust this myself to make them work properly. This are probably great if you don't do heavy duty exercise walking/running in them (think every day work  going to dinner or light shopping). But  doesn't seem to work well if you are very active on your feet.,1
good read,"Might better be called  ""love  hate  and treasure"". But this book is a treasure.  Readers interested in WWII and the aftermath will especially appreciate it's somewhat different take on the period immediately following the war.  Aside from the fact that it's simply a very good read  it gives a slightly less black and white picture of the times  especially the attitude toward Jews of not only the Nazis  but many of the Allies as well.  Going back and forth in time and featuring different characters  each layer adds to the picture  until the mystery is unraveled.  But don't expect a happy ending with all the knots unraveled.",1
new info seem useful,plastic construction equipment. These are about half or a third the size of the original metal tonka trucks. I purchased the dump truck and a scraper/loader. Both came with hard hats and a separate claw digger. They are pretty stout and the hard hats are surprisingly stout as well.  My 6 year old grandson loves to play in my lower yard which is sand.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
flowed really well,My review of Bigger than the sky. Beautiful  contemporary love story. Well-written  edited  all the characters were likeable  believable plot and it just flowed really well. Amelia and Kade reconnect in the small town they grew up in five years after she left him at the altar. She has to learn to trust him again  learn to say sorry and practice forgiveness. We watch her struggle with all three but succeed in the end  of course. Kade is the typical alpha male and what can I say but ... yes. There are a lot of very good but descriptive intimate scenes. A lot. Not complaining though because they were written in very well. What I also truly enjoyed was the humor. Being inside Amelia's head was wonderful  she is a good mess. Overall  a very good book and because I loved the other characters I would definitely continue with the series.,1
Pirates of the Caribbean,Dead man's Chest. My 8 year old grandson is VERY into pirate movies and is just now getting to see the pirates of the caribbean stories.  He loves them all.  I don't buy DVD's anymore - so much easier to stream from anywhere and I don't have to store the DVD.  In any case  in my opinion it is worth owning the whole list of the Pirates of the Caribbean!,1
find lighter options,Does the trick. This is a nice dry bag  with attachment points to connect a line and make a nice bear bag. The price is right  but you can find lighter options that do the trick just as well. Still  it does what it needs to do  and it s relatively cheap.,0
no sharp edges or parts that can fall off,"Excellent infant teether with gum massaging nubs drop resistant. There is one BPA-free silicone teether in this package. The silicone is super soft. I consider this cute and engaging. This is easy for the baby to grab and hold onto. It has no sharp edges or parts that can fall off. This is perfect as a teether and is one solid piece. I also love that the ears have nubs which act as a gum massaging / tooth cleaning ""tool."" As is typical  always supervise when the baby is using this. This is rated for 0 to 12 months.  This is made in China. The current price of $6.29 ($6.99 minus 10%) is competitively priced for this. Overall  I consider this a great teether that is drop resistant and small enough for newborns. I had given one like this to my neighbor's infant and he absolutely loved it.",1
themed self care gift,great self care set  fine quality  no issues  gift worthy items. Gift worthy set-comes with long back length silicone scrubber  a hand scrubber poof  a shower cap  and a set of hooks. All packed into a small box. Would make for a great stocking stuffer or as part of a themed self care gift.  I may pick up another set for this reason.  Everything is of good quality. I am extra impressed with the hand scrubber loofah/poof. It is rather robust. The longer silicone scrubber takes some getting used to. I have really come around to silicone scrubbers  as they just seem more hygienic to me. And even if you dont use bath wash on it (I often soap up my body  then run this over it)  it is lovely on the skin. Gentle  but effective. The shower cap is a nice addition. Use it in or out of shower.  No problems with this set. I think it is a great bundle of shower items. If I experience anything else  I will be back to update .,1
older ( 7+ years),cat string on stick toy. I get more joy out of these than my daughter's cat does.... sigh.... she doesn't seem too interested... she is hard to engage in anything though and she's older ( 7+ years).... I am thinking if you had a kitten it would be the bomb.. and maybe with a little catnip??,0
safe,Another quality fun product from Fisher-Price!. My grandson absolutely flipped out over this set. He loves the colors and the music and the elephant (he even takes it into bed with him  lol). I love Fisher-Price  and I buy their products almost exclusively for my grandkids. Educational  safe  and so much fun. I love the fact that the legs on the elephant move so my three year old grandbaby can move it across the floor like it was alive! No complaints at all about this product and I  too  have purchased other items in the Little People series and this one set is just as good  if not better  than others I have bought. This would make a wonderful Christmas or Holiday present for the little one in your life.,1
appreciated,Five Stars. Love westlife  hard to find cd's so this is appreciated. Thank you,1

blue hearts are very attractive,"Medium compression socks in a fun “normal sock” style blue hearts are attractive socks run large. This is my fifth pair of Lollop compression socks. However  two of the pairs are a small/medium size and three are medium large. This is a medium/large and runs a bit big.  I take a size 9 to 9.5 in a woman's shoe and 7.5 to 8 in a man's boot. I ordered these in a medium / large size which is supposed to be for that size foot. However  they are way too big in the foot area as the heel comes halfway up my ankle. They do fit around the calves nicely  however.  I love that they offer medium compression (15-20 mmHg) around my calves and some compression on the soles of the feet and arches. I felt comfortable in them all day without feeling like the life was being squeezed out of my legs. I also like the ""normal sock"" look of these knee-highs and they wash well in the washer but I lay them flat to dry. The blue hearts are very attractive even though the off-white is a bit dingy looking. I consider these socks very stylish. The material is 45% cotton  40% nylon  and 15% spandex.  If the sizing was specified correctly  this would have gotten 5 stars. ",1
easy to maneuver,Wonderful way to exercise from home!. This is a fantastic jump rope. I love the way it feels in my hands (soft yet firm with memory foam). Super lightweight  easy to maneuver  I am able to get a great workout with minimal effort. I am writing this during the pandemic of 2020 and it has been great to be able to get exercise without having to go to the gym. If you are looking for a way to get a great cardio workout at a minimal cost  this jump rope is the way to do it.,1
not hesitate to purchase Kursheuel gloves,Beautiful well made elegant gloves. These soft dress leather (not suede) gloves are true to size  have a warm wool lining  length is slightly longer than wrist length (as pictured)  and the leather bow trim is very nicely done.  These were a great value for the price.  I would not hesitate to purchase Kursheuel gloves again.,1
contact information,"Wine Reviews  News  and More. Wine Spectator is a good wine magazine that seeks to keep the reader informed about new wine products  wine facts and education  and wine events. This magazine is published 17 times per year  so it is available often enough that most wine lovers will have more than their fill of reading material.  Most of the material in Wine Spectator deals with buying wine  and you can expect to find several rating lists in every issue. The editors of the magazine supply the majority of the wine ratings  so when you read that one wine earned 95 points and another only 80  you need to keep in mind that these ratings are from the perspective of people who have sampled hundreds or even thousands of different wines. And with each rating or analysis  there is often contact information  such as the name of the winery or web page  so that you can learn more and/or inquire on making a purchase.  To help shoppers find the wines in each issue  Wine Spectator includes a detachable card that includes the names of the different featured wines. This is a handy addition  because it eliminates the need to copy down names of wine on paper or attempt to memorize the titles. All you do is check off the wines you like on the card and take it with you to your favorite beverage store for easy reference.  Wine Spectator seems to have an obsession with lists and with outlandish proclamations. It is common to find lists like ""World's 100 Greatest Pinot"" or ""The 50 Finest California Reds"". Consumers are attracted to listings  and that is probably why the magazine gave in and made lists a regular part of most issues. And it is common to find extreme statements like ""This is the best Cabernet Sauvignon on the Planet"" or ""Greatest German White Wine Ever"". The publication does this to attract attention and sell more issues  but it could get annoying to some readers.  In spite of these few annoyances  Wine Spectator is still a good magazine. The writers at Wine Spectator are very good  very convincing  and very persuasive. They really know wine  and it comes through in their articles and recommendations. The editors articulate themselves very well and they know just the right way to describe the different brands and styles. It all adds up to a very informative magazine publication on the world of wine.",1
mustard caper chicken,“There is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”. Susie Fishbein’s bestselling series “Kosher By Design” goes out with a bang with the final ninth volume “Kosher By Design Brings It Home.” Inspired by Susie’s travels to France  Italy  Mexico  Israel  and North America  you’ll find kosher versions of favorites such as Korean short ribs  lasagna bolognaise  and shoyu tamago ramen (which normally has a pork-based broth here in Japan).  I have several kosher cookbooks that I cook from regularly (Including The Joy of Kosher and “The New Kosher”)  but this was my first experience with the “Kosher By Design” series.  The menu leans most heavily towards Israeli and Italian dishes  including staples like arancini (fried stuffed risotto)   ravioli  Tuscan bean and farro soup  veal scallopini  brachiole  (fried) pizza Napolitana  ragu Napolitano  and lasagna  but you’ll also find Asian-inspired dishes (short ribs  spicy kim chee hangar steaks   ramen  chicken adobo) and Latin flair in the form of chicken flautas  ceviche  and pulled beef tacos.  The salads and dairy / fish sections were particular favorites of mine. I love light  refreshing salads for nearly every meal  and the Israeli-inspired salads here are perfect for hot  hazy days when you don’t feel like spending hours at the stove. I loved the Provencal wheatberry salad  Lumina market salad  Carmel Spa pomegranate almond salad (I use pomegranate molasses as a salad dressing and was happy to see it in a recipe!)  kale squash Caesar salad  root vegetable apple salad  and Chedva’s warm French potato salad was a revelation: baby potatoes  haricots verts  and a tangy white wine-herb dressing made this memorable (to make it dairy  you can add crumbled feta while warm).  Poultry includes rosemary lavender chicken  Amalfi sage chicken  and mustard caper chicken  and the meat dishes include various roasts  grills  and stews: pumpkin braised short ribs are perfect for fall  while the lamb cholent “cassoulet” reminded me of my trip to France’s Perigord in 2012. Dairy dishes include decadent bread pudding  farroto  pasta frittata  and risotto  while the fish dishes really shone: I loved the silan-glazed salmon (see photo) and the showstopping citrus-glazed salmon  layered with rows of perfectly symmetrical cucumber slices atop a citrus mayo. I also enjoyed trying my hand at the khachapuri shakshuka having taught many students from Georgia  I’d long heard of the magic of khachapuri but had never tried making it before. Susie’s clear instructions (and the easy shakshuka topping save the extra for omelettes and scrambled eggs!) make this a winner for breakfast or brunch.  Vegetarians have many options in the sides chapter  including a beautiful (and deceptively simple) eggplant and tomato tart (see photo)  tershi and couscous (I’m a fan of all things pumpkin and had not heard / tried this amazing Libyan Jewish dish before)  sweet potato wontons with teriyaki dipping sauce  chestnut tomato quinoa  and freekeh pilaf. Desserts are sure to tempt with a delightfully sweet/tart lemon tiramisu  Beresheet Spa Kanafe  banana  date  and pecan cake  almond bobka ring  halvah baklava  and fudgy New Fishbein Brownies punched up with espresso powder. Recipes are clearly labeled as meat  dairy or pareve (with some having multiple options depending on dairy-free substitutions) using color-coded icons. Note that some spellings use the Hebrew / Ashkenazi variations (chummos for hummus  seviche for ceviche  bobka for babka  etc.). I love that the font is a little larger and easily readable from several feet away as I tend to cook using a cookbook holder (and the ingredients are handily in bold). Each recipe comes with a full-page photo by John Uher showcasing each dish. The recipes (main dishes in particular) tend to be more elegant / upscale than some of my other kosher cookbooks (dishes like dried fruit and quinoa stuffed capons  turkey breast with hoisin tangerine glaze  and pumpkin braised short ribs would all make wonderful holiday centerpieces)  but there are also plenty of recipes that come together quickly for weeknight meals (the eggplant and tomato tart  fish dishes  and veggie sides).  Overall  “Kosher by Design Brings It Home” is a wonderful finale to Susie’s best-selling series (with nearly 500 000 books sold) and a great way to taste the world from the comfort of your (kosher) kitchen Susie’s headnotes introduce the reader to places and people she’s encountered on her fifteen-year culinary journey spanning several continents and multiple food traditions  from Italian nonnas to Yemenite family recipes passed down across generations. But at the end of the day  in Susie’s words  “there is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”  (Thank you to the Trina Kaye Organization for the review copy!),1
empty stomach,Great to be taking during this pandemic!. I had been reading that for optimal immunity I should be taking 2000 mg a day. So  I have been taking these capsules one in the morning and one at bedtime. I often take these on an empty stomach and have had no adverse side effects. I also like that these vitamins also have Rose Hips  something that my other Vitamin C pills have not have. These are made and produced in the United States  which really sealed the deal for me. Highly recommend!,1
stories,Too religious. I wanted to enjoy literary essays  stories  and articles  but it seems like every issue I received this last year is packed full of a religious agenda of one variety or another.  To be sure  the themes seem to be an eclectic variety of spiritual and cultural mysticism  but the magazine never just leaves it out.  It's always a tome espousing some collection of beliefs  cultural systems  and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence using religious narratives  symbols  and sacred histories or allusions from one or another.  Everytime I read it  I feel like I'm being proselytized.,0
wanted to like the case,It does hold the S pen. If the case was just to hold the S pen this case would get 5 stars but in protection for the phone forget that. No shock walls the case is way too flimsy. And make sure you buy the right S pen. You need the pen made the S21 ultra. I wanted to like the case. The case I have used most is the Speck Presidio 2 Grip.,1
cats love these,Bit pricey   but my cats love them.. My cats love these. Dont order in summer or when too hot as they will melt. A bit pricey  but my fur babies are worth the treat.,1
ok,Cleaning. Just ok,0
versatile,Perfect for many uses!!!. Great bags and great for multiple purposes. Not only are they great for refrigerated foods (cheese  fruits  vegetables) but I find them great for freezing food as well (works best if you squeeze all the air out before sealing the bag). Needless to say  they also work well for lunch bag use (although they may be a little large unless you are storing more than one sandwich). However  most of all I also love these for storing small items around the house. I have bags of nails and picture hangers in these out in the garage  spools of threads and pins in my laundry room  I use them in the bathroom for small cosmetic items and hair pins and the smaller children use them for crayons and picture puzzle pieces. I honestly can't say enough about the versatility and the great variety of things you can do with these Ziploc slider bags. Every house should have at least one box of them available at all times. Can be used for so many purposes.,1

firm once it’s easily installed with the suction cup,Works very well. The shower head holder doesn’t rotate as much as I’d like  but it is firm once it’s easily installed with the suction cup.  It’s a vast improvement over my old one.,1
compression is strong,Socks come over knee the strong compression makes them uncomfortable on me for all day wear. I love the color of these compression socks. I ordered the small/medium size even though I should have ordered a large because I take a size 9 to 9.5 shoe. Nevertheless  these fit me perfectly and the large would have been too big. The compression is strong  so I do find these difficult to wear all day.  The only thing I do not like about these socks is that they come up to my lower thighs which requires me to fold them over to get them below my knees.,0
rugged,apple watch band. Husband has an apple watch and had one these  this is actually a replacement after he torched his first one by accident!  He quickly reordered this after market band for his apple watch.  Loves it.  We do project management  job sites and so it has to take some abuse and this band is rugged.Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
hard hats are surprisingly stout,plastic construction equipment. These are about half or a third the size of the original metal tonka trucks. I purchased the dump truck and a scraper/loader. Both came with hard hats and a separate claw digger. They are pretty stout and the hard hats are surprisingly stout as well.  My 6 year old grandson loves to play in my lower yard which is sand.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
covered with a cotton sleeve,Made of bamboo... The interior is made of bamboo foam - and covered with a cotton sleeve.  Very comfortable roller - firm for a good massage.  My granddaughter swears by it  and is able to handle it easily  for a gentle or very firm massage.  She prefers it to other rollers.,1
feeding your skin richly with Dead Sea minerals,Wonderful product! Highly recommend!. I need to begin by saying I absolutely love Ahava products. I found Ahava on a pilgrimage I did to Israel in 2008 and a visit to the site of Masada at the Dead Sea. I picked up a gift package of a few of their products and I was immediately hooked. Every day I use their Mud exfoliator  at night I use their night cream and at least once a week I use one of their Mud Pack facial products. I am 61 years old and am often told I look to be in my low 50s. I was thrilled when I saw this new Ahava Osmoter product. I have been using this daily now for about a week and I will say my skin feels and looks like it is glowing. It goes on like silk  has a nice subtle fragrnace and my skin feels amazing throughout the day (even after I put on makeup and/or sun screen). I know this is pricy and you might be able to do better purchasing elsewhere (if you find it cheaper). You won't find a product line that is better for you than Ahava  feeding your skin richly with Dead Sea minerals and keeping you looking young and vibrant.,1
useful resources,A great magazine for teachers and little kids. Ladybug is full of useful resources for early childhood teachers and the material is useful even if the magazines are out of date. The ideas in the magazines can be modified for use in the classroom. I teach children from kindergarten to year three  so I need a wide range of suitable materials. Since I am also a parent  I really enjoyed borrowing the magazines for my daughter when she was small. She loved the magazines and when she grew out of them  she graduated to 'Cricket' which is the magazine that follows on from 'Ladybug'.Since 'Ladybug' contains lots of activities  stories and songs  it doesn't take long to build up a useful library of resources. What's more! The activities are age appropriate and they all work.,1
looks great,Wonderful upcycle. Perfect for my “steampunk” light bathroom. Looks great with the perfect amount of novelty to it. Thanks for the extra tlc,1
love this color,Great stockpot  perfect for everyone!. This is a great stockpot for the money. First  it is super attractive  well made and lightweight. I love this color  too  it blends with all my kitchen decor. I love Rachel Ray products as they always provide good products at reasonable prices. This 6 quart size is great for making pasta and soups. This would make an excellent bridal shower or housewarming present for anyone. Highly recommend!,1
paranormal activity,"Great story with good writing!. What an intense storyline. Layla is a strong but determine woman. She used to believe in love. After she is left to fend for herself and her 2 daughters  she feels the responsibility that comes with raising them and moving on with her life. She ends up moving into the Manor..the same one that has to be finished with the restoration and has its own ghosts....and this is where Laylas story begins. This story is so well written that as you read it you can actually ""feel"" what the characters are going through. There is plenty of paranormal activity that will have you believing and wondering if it's really possible. I highly recommend this q/series to everyone. Can also be read as a stand alone  but why would you want to miss the beginning of the story with so many secrets and shocking surprises?",1
freeze become part of the problem,faucet covers. These are basically nylon  padded material.  I am hoping they will repel the water enough that when it freezes it doesn't then become part of the problem.  Draw string pull  black in color.  Time will tell and I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,0
bright work space,Helpful!. I used to live in the midwest. In the winter  it was dark when I went to work and dark when I came home. I was never diagnosed with SAD  but I believe I suffered from it. I live in the south now and it has been better. Though this winter  we've had a lot of grey days. On those days  it's easy to feel lethargic. This light has been helpful! It provides outdoor light  indoors! It's easy to use. The buttons are on the lower front. This comes with the power brick which was nice. A lot of electronic items I've gotten recently don't come with one any more. I have this light set up in my home office. Not only does it help boost my overall mood  but it gives me a bright work space which I like. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the little stand on the back of it. It feels like it's going to break easily. So far it's doing okay  but when you move it to get it positioned  it seems questionable. Other than that  I am enjoying this lamp.,1
buttons,Not bad!. So I got this with the intent to play Super Mario Odyssey. I received this and the official Pro Controller around the same time and  while I much prefer playing with the Pro Controller because of many reasons  I still use this one for other games besides Odyssey.  The feel of this one is a bit on the light side. It's hollow  though I suspect that's for any lack of vibration. The buttons are nice and clicky  more so than the ones on the Pro Controller  and I actually prefer the buttons on this one. However  because of the slightly wider (larger?) size  the shoulder buttons may be slightly more difficult to reach than the Pro Controller. The thumbsticks are longer  which I do not like for platformers and racing games. They may be good for FPS games  but I find there are far more genres of games on the Switch than FPS.  The back buttons are a nice addition  though I hardly ever use them. I've programmed them to duplicate L and R and thought I'd use them more often  but I don't. They work well enough and are positioned so as not to be in the way of accidental presses  but are within reach if necessary.  The texture is a nice matte feel  so no sweaty palms.  Overall  a great controller if you're looking for one on the budget.,0
moved it to an even farther location,STINKS!!!!. OK so this product is amazing at catching flies however it stinks so bad! My whole backyard smells like a rotting fish market within like four days. We moved it to an even for their location away from the area where everyone hangs out in and it still stunk so bad. We had to throw it away. I would so totally buy this if you were not anywhere near it but if you plan to be socializing within 300 yards or so from it prepare for stink,0
shipped very quickly,Fantastic. This is a great record with 2 great songs on it  and it was shipped very quickly  two thumbs up!,1
fits her perfectly,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
story was often heartbreaking,Rich but sad story. The writing was wonderful. The story was often heartbreaking and then a turn for the better would help me to the next chapter. I'm glad I read it  but wished I hadn't stopped and started with it so much.,1
comfortable roller,Made of bamboo... The interior is made of bamboo foam - and covered with a cotton sleeve.  Very comfortable roller - firm for a good massage.  My granddaughter swears by it  and is able to handle it easily  for a gentle or very firm massage.  She prefers it to other rollers.,1
skin feels amazingly soft and clean,Irish Spring is the best!. I have loved Irish Spring since I was a kid. Typically using bar soap  Irish Spring has been a staple in my bathroom for years. Now that I  and my kids  are older  we find ourselves switching from bar soap to liquid body wash. I was anxious to try this Irish Spring body wash and I am so glad I did. Same great fragrance as the bar soap  but in a handy pump bottle. This seems to last a long time as we have been using it for almost two weeks now and the bottle is only about 1/4 depleted. My bathroom smells great from the fragrance  our skin feels amazingly soft and clean. Absolutely love this and highly recommend!,1
comparisons to Jimmy Buffet,Transports You Away to a Caribbean Island. This is my first Bertie Higgins album  so I can't compare it to his others.  Until this album I only knew him from his mega-hit Key Largo.  It's a great song  but played so much on the radio that I almost got sick of it.  Unfortunately not many of his other songs got as much radio play and that's a shame.  Bertie has a rich clear voice and lot of great songs that transport you away to the islands or to south Florida.  Comparisons to Jimmy Buffet are probably inevitable  since they both seem to sing about layed-back liesure or island living.  Jimmy's fans are known as parrotheads and Bertie's are boneheads.  You might think he copied Buffet and just changed a few things.  Perhaps he did to some extent (Buffet was one of his inspirations)  but I think that Higgins is a much better singer than Buffet  as much as I like Jimmy Buffet.  Sure  the pirate theme seems something contrived and gimmicky and perhaps gets a little silly at times  but it doesn't detract from the fine quality of the songs.  There are a lot of songs here it's a good collection of Bertie's best  I think.  One of the traps that a themed based singer can fall into is having all his songs sound alike.  Each of Bertie's songs sound different.  He also doesn't have one those voices where every song sounds the same  which you find more so with Buffet and various other singers.  There is enough variety in his delivery and the sound of his voice to make this interesting and enjoyable not the same song over and over again.  The themes of most of the songs may be the same  but the variety is still there and that's quite a difficult thing to achieve.,1
typical alpha male,My review of Bigger than the sky. Beautiful  contemporary love story. Well-written  edited  all the characters were likeable  believable plot and it just flowed really well. Amelia and Kade reconnect in the small town they grew up in five years after she left him at the altar. She has to learn to trust him again  learn to say sorry and practice forgiveness. We watch her struggle with all three but succeed in the end  of course. Kade is the typical alpha male and what can I say but ... yes. There are a lot of very good but descriptive intimate scenes. A lot. Not complaining though because they were written in very well. What I also truly enjoyed was the humor. Being inside Amelia's head was wonderful  she is a good mess. Overall  a very good book and because I loved the other characters I would definitely continue with the series.,1
alternative to down,Love these pillows….I recommend.. Not too high or low comfortable.  Nice alternative to downe.,1
well made of excellent materials,Great Suede Pub Cap. Bought this as a gift for my son  who is very picky about what he likes.  He absolutely loves the Wigens Ante Suede Denim Pub Cap and says it is his favorite!  Fits true to size  is well made of excellent materials  was shipped quickly and well.  Don't hesitate to purchase this for your discriminating cap wearer!,1

history,"The Best (No Further Title Required). As a poet  there are a few places I'd love to be published. There's the New Yorker  the Atlantic  and Poetry Magazine. There are other places I want to see my work  but these three are  to me  huge. They vet the best poems  and publish them.  Only Poetry focuses on poetry. A review of their history would tell you they have tenure. Great poets are published here. Ones we all know  and ones we all should know. Unlike the New Yorker and the Atlantic  Poetry is especially open to unknowns. If you are good enough  you are in  whether you are famous or not.  Like most literary magazines  the design is clean  almost simple. Here  considering everything from paper color to typography  poems are more than printed: they are framed. No  no  no fancy design. Rather  they clear the way so that the poems are highlighted. Nothing but.  An essay and a few reviews finish each issue  followed by a couple pages of ads. All black and white.  If you are looking to buy a true literary magazine  as much curated as it is edited  pick this one. Don't do it to ""support the arts "" but because each issue is worth the time and money.  I fully recommend Poetry.  Anthony Trendl americanspeechwriter.com",1
helpful to focus the heat,"Convenient. These disposable grills are awesome for a quick  easy bbq.  They are perfect for ""precooked"" like hotdogs/brats.  If you want to grill something raw  chicken/beef  I find a piece of foil over the top of cooking food is helpful to focus the heat.  I love that the ""charcoal"" is all natural and no lighter fluid is necessary. I use the smaller size when it's just me. The larger size cooked 8 hotdogs and 4 brats easily (space).  I also like the sanitary aspect of using these... no grill to clean or grilling on a surface that might not be cleaned well. NOTE:  Beware of using the wire brushes on your grill - the metal brissles can be ingested and puncture your intestines - which is life threatening not to mention painful!  When using a regular grill  once the grates have cooled you can soak the grill grates in garbage sack with a little detergent. Next day  hose them off. Yeah  it's a little more of a hassle  but NO metal brissles to ingest. All in all  these disposable grills are really meant for ""lightweight"" grilling projects. I just like the additional positive aspects of using them  like the cleanliness aspect. Hope this info helps!",1
not a bad track to be found here,The 1966 / 1968 foundations of two more 'lost' Elvis LPs. Just who was sleeping at the wheel at RCA back in the mid- to late-sixties?  At least in the case of Elvis Presley's recording career  I think they were just sick and tired and worn-out from dealing with his manager  Colonel Tom Parker.  Movies ruled in Parker's world  so Elvis' recording career was on the back burner.  Or was it?  Elvis continued to do non-film recording sessions at RCA's Studio B in Nashville  often with thrilling results.  Instead of issuing cohesive LPs from the sessions  however  Parker scattered the tracks over singles A- and B-sides  soundtrack album 'bonus ' songs  and budget LP filler.  Where the heck was RCA's A&R advisors?  For diehard Elvis fans like yours truly  this was an ongoing bone of contention for years.  Years when LPs had become much more prominent and important in the post-Beatles sixties.  This 18-track compilation presents  in essence  a double-dip of what might have been: Superior material that would have been the basis of two more solid Elvis albums in 1966 and 1968.  The Grammy winning How Great Thou Art was the non-soundtrack studio LP of 1967.  Love Letters  Down in the Alley  I'll Remember You  Guitar Man  Big Boss Man  You Don't Know Me  and the magnificent Dylan cover title song are among the highlights but  in truth  there's not a bad track to be found here.  Oh  what might have been ... Happily  we can all enjoy it now the way it should have been all those years ago.  Five brightly shining stars and very highly recommended.,1
good size for creating shoulder pads,Nice Quality. These interlocking exercise foam mats are a good quality. They do fit together nicely and would offer a decent and comfortable flooring if that was your intended purpose. Mine is not. My son likes to create cosplay costumes. He uses foam pieces like this to create elaborate costumes. He heats them up and while they're warm and pliable  he puts them up against curved surfaces such as large buckets and as they cool down  they retain the shape. These are smaller than the last ones he got from the store  but they are a good size for creating shoulder pads or smaller needed costume parts. These have been working well for his latest creation.,1
thick velvet yarn,Quality thick velvet yarn. Easy to work with and maintain even sides.  Did not need a border to have neat edges.  This is my favorite weight velvet yarn.,1

Christmas card,Christmas gift. Bought this for my 4 year old granddaughter and she made us a Christmas card out of the box. It was really cute.,1
gentle moisturizing product,Moisturizing. I've been using this cream primarily around my eyes. It's a thin consistency and is more like a lotion than a cream. It has a light pleasant scent. Most importantly  it doesn't irritate or sting my eyes. I've had several eye creams that when my eyes tear or if I sweat  it runs into my eyes causing some stinging or burning. This does not  so that is quite good. It's a gentle  moisturizing product.,1
white noise machine,Great way to combine both your alarm and your white noise machine!. I love this JKZ combination white noise and alarm machine. I had been using a standard white noise machine for years now (it's the only way I can get a decent nights sleep). I had been looking for one to replace my existing one that would have a clock display on it (so I can see the hours and get rid of my separate clock which takes up too much space on my end table). I love the way this looks (attractive and modern)   the variety of sounds is great and the display is large and clear. Highly recommend!,1
sizing is off,Nice collar but I feel like sizing is off. It’s a lovely collar but I think the sizing is off because it was far too small for my pups than the other collars I’ve gotten them even tho it’s the “same” measurements 🤷🏼‍♀️ Can’t speak for durability or anything as I returned the item once I opened it and saw it was too small,0
maneuver from the front to back of my head easily,Great hair dryer gets the job done quickly!. This Jinri hair dryer is among one of the best I have ever owned. Strong and powerful  my hair dries super quick. It has varying speeds and heat levels which allows me to dry and style my hair at the same time. It also fits well in my hand  is relatively light weight  and I can maneuver from the front to back of my head easily. I love this red color as well and it matches my decor perfectly. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a new  quality hair dryer at a reasonable price.,1
love it,Use for notes. Love it and easy to used,1
gray,santa hair and beard. The picture shows such a lovely bright white beard and hair piece... however.. the one I received is really gray.  NOT bright white at all. Disappointed.  It comes netted  so I removed a bit of the netting to see it was just the netting that was gray... sadly not.  The netting does keep the faux hairs neat until you want to use them.  However  I am going to be looking for a more true white set. UPDATE:  11/22... Ok... The wig is a mess.  We discarded it.  And again... the beard is GRAY.... NOT WHITE.  However  I will report that it is very full.,0
super easy to put together,Good quality  reasonably priced desk/table. This Decoholic computer desk is surprisingly nice for the money. Nicely made  good quality and super easy to put together (took me about 10 minutes and I am usually technically challenged when it comes to this stuff). Super functional  nice size  it can be used as a desk or even as just a place to showcase items in your home. I already had a desk in my home (one with drawers) and I am using this as a place to put my printer. Highly recommend!,1
cute AF,Totally worth the money and cute AF. Totally adorable and will be a gift for my 11yr old  she will love it!,1
lots of cats,Animal Crossing Vibe. This cat island puzzle has an Animal Crossing vibe to it. The image is fun and colorful  plus it has lots of cats! The pieces are a good size and cut well. I didn't notice any puzzle dust. I did not care for the company logo being on the back of every piece. That actually made it a little more difficult to sort because you had to look at both sides to make sure you were putting the right side up. It doesn't come with a poster of the image either. I really appreciate that addition to puzzles. It's a pain to have to hold the box in your hand just so you can see where things go. The full image is on the bottom of the box. The lid has a blown up picture that doesn't show everything. Plus  the brand logo is on both of the images. They really are pushing their logo on us!! They do include a business card size picture of the puzzle but that's really impossible to use because it's so small.,1
Nice!,Very Nice!. I love these! I also Appreciated the additional notes written on the envelope so the postal system didn't screw them up. Thanks for the added care!,1
legs on the elephant move,Another quality fun product from Fisher-Price!. My grandson absolutely flipped out over this set. He loves the colors and the music and the elephant (he even takes it into bed with him  lol). I love Fisher-Price  and I buy their products almost exclusively for my grandkids. Educational  safe  and so much fun. I love the fact that the legs on the elephant move so my three year old grandbaby can move it across the floor like it was alive! No complaints at all about this product and I  too  have purchased other items in the Little People series and this one set is just as good  if not better  than others I have bought. This would make a wonderful Christmas or Holiday present for the little one in your life.,1
summer read,A great summer read with lots of themes. A great summer read with lots of themes. Perfect for a book club discussion,1
color variety,Simple headbands that loosely grip my headwish there were more color variety. There are 12 headbands in this set and practically all of them look a similar shade of pastel pink  purple  and yellow. Only one headband is bold with an emerald green. I would have liked a red  black  and brown in this set. However  this appears to be designed for young girls or ballerinas who would love these colors.  I tried these on and the headbands are comfortable and do not squeeze my head. They also stay put. I have a small head so these would probably feed a youngster just fine.  The current price of $15.99 comes to a reasonable $1.33 per headband.,1
might work for some,nasal dilator. These nasal dilators do not work for me - but maybe for some one?  They are silicone tiny tubes.  Comes with various sizes - you pinch them and put them up your nose.  But I found them uncomfortable and actually plugged my nose.. maybe my nasal passages are too small - which is the only reason I didn't rate them a 1 star.  Might work for some?   Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes. Bottom line  I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,1
Linda Castillo books,AWESOME !!!!!!. I love Linda Castillo books and this was part of her Kate Burkholder series  .. I cant WAIT for the next book to come out which I believe is due in June or July  ... Love her writings !!!,1
dieing slowly,It wasn't worth it !!. Well it was worth a shot ! But I gotta pass cause as you can see from beginning to end the last photo its not looking good   my plant arrived in bad shape and the driver left the box upside down ( no way to tell which end was up ) after getting it planted I was hoping it would make it 😬but its dieing 😭slowly its going the process of shipping was just to hard for it so I wont be continuing my Subscription 😞 2 leafs left barely hanging on !! I really think the care given to the plant during shipping was crap ! Maybe a brighter box like orange or red with a warning or fragile ! For shippers to take notice idk but the box was just thrown around like all the rest ! The box was dented   you could see it was not handled well ! So try the service if you want but thats my story 🙏🌿🌱🌵🍀🙏,0

green light lets me know when the headset is fully charged,Works well. The Lampelc Headset Charging Dock was easy to put together. Plastic seems a little flimsy but it's doing a good job holding the headset and controllers. I have two Oculus Quest 2 sets so I had headsets  controllers and charging cables all over the place. This stand keeps everything together and it looks nice. I love how the green light lets me know when the headset is fully charged.,1

Will Friedwald,A pairing made in heaven.... Long before she became known as a sultry sex kitten with 1950's smash hit Fever  Peggy Lee had practiced her sexier side with Benny Goodman on hits such as Why Don't You Do Right. Lee received her big break in 1941 when Benny Goodman heard her sing his vocalist Helen Forrest was about to leave his band  and he was looking for a replacement. A few days later  Lee recorded Elmer's Tune  the first track on The Complete Recordings 1941-1947. That same year  several more of Lee/Goodman's arrangements went on to be hits  including I Got It Bad and Winter Weather.  The Complete Recordings gathers 38 tracks by Lee and Goodman  despite the fact that Lee married Goodman's guitarist Dave Barbour and took a year off  returning to work on her solo career with Barbour (in 1945  she signed a solo contract with Capitol). 32 of the tracks were recorded between 1941 and 1942 and displayed Peggy Lee's widening range to perfection  from blues (Blues in the Night)  ballads (How Deep is the Ocean?  How Long Has This Been Going On?  When the Roses Bloom Again  Where or When  The Way You Look Tonight)  holiday tunes (Winter Weather)  uptempo numbers (Let's Do It  The Freedom Train)  and everything in between. It's amazing to hear how she matures from that first jittery performance on Elmer's Tune to the confident vocalist she'd become.  The remastering has produced a crisp  clear sound  and the discs are printed to look like the old vinyl labels that Columbia's used with Frank Sinatra reissues. The excellent liner notes are by the incomparable Will Friedwald  who writes for all the Sinatra Columbia / Capitol reissues and releases  and include rare photos and a complete list of original catalog numbers  recording dates  and studio personnel. This is a fabulous investment for fans of Big Band (Goodman in particular) and Peggy Lee  but any fan of the Great American Songbook and music of the 1940s will find much to enjoy here.,1
Crosswords Plus does nearly all of the same things,"Decent  But Expensive Not Fully Functional on New Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" Tablet. CROSSWORDS by Standalone is a decent crossword puzzle app  but inflexible and expensive.  On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet  the working display shows about two-thirds of a weekday NY Times puzzle grid  and I can't find any way to resize the grid to show the whole puzzle at once. (You must swipe down or hit an arrow button to reveal the lower one-third of the grid.)  The Across and Down clues appear alongside the grid in a readable typeface  but the clues are cut off at the right.  (Perhaps this is an 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD issue that the developer will correct fortunately  clicking on a cut-off clue will display the full clue below the grid.)  The puzzle hints--found under the list icon beside the app icon  at the left--don't always work as expected.  For example  ""reveal entire puzzle"" only filled in one word (for the 1-down clue) when I started from the ""hints for 1-down"" screen.  In contrast  ""reveal entire puzzle"" filled in the entire puzzle when I started from a ""press-and-hold-on-clue"" popup.  Worse  the general settings for navigation (e.g.  ""skip filled squares""  ""show mistakes"") don't seem to function at all.  (Perhaps this is another Kindle Fire HD issue for the developer to fix.)  The app allows you to enter multiple letters in a single square  and to look up puzzle info (must-haves for NY Times crossword solvers).  If you are a NY Times crosswords subscriber  the app will automatically download the daily puzzles for you.  The app comes with an assortment of puzzles already installed  and allows you to browse for and download many more puzzles from the Internet.  It also allows you to establish an account and compare your times with other solvers.  However  the FREE [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] app does nearly all of the same things.  (Crosswords Plus does not download your NY Times subscription puzzles automatically  although it makes it easy to download them daily it doesn't come with puzzles loaded  although it points you to free Internet sources and it doesn't have a feature for comparing scores with other solvers.)  In addition  [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] allows you to resize the grid  offers an alternate clues-only view  includes the usual hints options  and has navigational settings (skipping boxes  etc.) that are fully functional on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet.  Even if this CROSSWORDS app worked perfectly  I would still prefer [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]].  For this reason  and because of the high price and current Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet issues  I rate CROSSWORDS at 3 stars.",1
Great deal,Five Stars. Great deal  sounds terrific. Fast shipping,1
absorbs sweat,Great set of dish washing gloves!. This gloves are perfect for dish washing or other household cleaning duties. They keep your hands protect nicely during all these duties we love so dearly  not. They are a good quality product that should stand up the test of time quite nicely  only time will tell. These gloves come with a cotton flocking that makes wearing them nice and comfortable and absorbs your sweat to some degree. Getting a pair of these for $10 is very good so I can recommend purchasing these for sure!,1
large variety of products,"Was great...not so much now.. UPDATE November  2019: I think it's time to put my money into a different subscription. Each month  there are fewer and fewer full and ""deluxe sample"" size products. Those that are full size aren't worth much money. There's no point of me putting my money into so many samples.  OVERVIEW: I just received my first Cocotique box. I was a little nervous  as I'm new to subscription boxes  but I'm actually quite satisfied with the products. Most of them are full-size  and others are large enough to get quite a few uses out of. The month's box (the actual cardboard box the products are in) is absolutely beautiful! Included is a card with extensive information about all of the products  including prices and where to find them should you decide to purchase them. I absolutely love that they included this because I can easily find the products if I want to order them  and I can see the value of the products versus the cost of the box ($25/month).  PRODUCTS: With that being said  the value of the products in the box is well worth the cost of the subscription (in this box  at least). The price of the products come up to about double the cost of the box (approximately $47). So  I'm happy with the value. You get more than 2 or 3 items  and they're pretty large.  CUSTOMER SERVICE CONTACT: One item (eyeshadow) was broken (still sealed). I emailed them on a Saturday and they responded within 2 or 3 hours to apologize and let me know that a replacement was on the way. I greatly appreciate the quick and polite customer service.  SHIPPING: Shipping was EXTRA fast  but...things are not safely secured in the box. I'm not sure if this is how the eyeshadow box was broken or not  but the products definitely need to be better secured. The products are packaged with pretty crinkled paper  but not enough to hold the products in place. Some products are heavier than others  which may cause some issues in some boxes. This is reason for the 4-star review. All of the products were strewn throughout the box in an unorganized way. Unfortunately  mail carriers don't (and sometimes can't) always take the time to ensure that things aren't thrown around during shipping  so more secure packaging may make things a little better.  BILLING: I have to be honest and say that the way they do their billing is a bit...odd to me. They bill on your anniversary date  even if the box isn't due to be shipped for weeks. I signed up in early to mid-March  and I just received my first box  the April box. This  of course  depends when you sign up  but when you initially sign up determines if you receive your first box for the CURRENT month or the month after. I was just now charged for next month's box  even though I just received this month's (April) box today. Again  I'm fairly new to subscription boxes and the other ones that I'm subscribed to charge on your anniversary and send your box when you're charged. YES  this is stated in multiple places on Cocotique's website and other places  so I was aware of it  but again  it's just a bit odd to me because it seems like you're waiting for a very long time for something you've paid for. But  that's the way they work and I'll more than happily deal with it to see what they have in store.  BOTTOM LINE: I will be continuing my subscription. I'm fairly new to the makeup world  so being able to try a wide variety of products (again  these products are large  so you can do a lot more than ""try"" them) without having to buy all of them one-by-one comes in handy. It saves both money and time. I've definitely told my friends about this subscription box  and I'm excited to see what will be in future boxes. I think I'll be ordering some of the past boxes  also.  As time goes by and I receive more boxes  I'll update my review.",1
movies follow each other well,Good movies.. I was rather pleased with the movies. A lot of people criticized them  making fun of them...... The 1st movie does have a lot of leading names in it.  But the movies follow each other well.... I didn't want to shut it off. Loved Viggo as Satan.... And I also liked John Light as Satan.... He was a bit more subdued  but now I'm looking for other things he's been in.,1

color is great,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
relief of being able to have some things macroed to a single mouse button,A Lot of Mouse. I have never used a gaming mouse before. Actually I've looked down on people who did for the same reason I don't like some players being on steroids in major league sports. But now that I'm getting older  my reactions are slower  my fingers are not as quick on the keys and...Oh...I guess I like it for exactly the same reasons athletes love steroids...  But on a serious note.  Mousing and key gnashing do take a toll. I don't know that this mouse is a complete solution to it. But I have had relief of being able to have some things macroed to a single mouse button.  If nothing else  it has created a different movement.  I like the quality of the mouse.  The tracking is very good  the feel is okay  the looks are richly industrial.  I'm not huge on the extending base to the mouse.  I just wish it had been a little bigger to fit my hand  but it fits fine without extending. Personally  a little heavier would feel a little better as well.  All in all I'm very impressed  and wished I had given into &#34juicing&#34 my game a long time ago.,1
Deep sections that hold a lot of food,Kids love them. Great silicone plates for kids. Deep sections that hold a lot of food. Kids love them and enjoy an assortment of food with each meal. They appear well made and are easy to clean.,1
not enough for most hairstyles,You get ONE PIECE. Important to realize. Well  I am not sure why someone would want this particular hair piece. It is ok  and the hair feels very slick. But you only get ONE piece  so it would not be enough for most hairstyles.  I misplaced my photos  but will add them when I find them. It is just super important to realize you do not get a whole hairpiece  but just one small clip's worth of hair. To look like the vendor photo  you would need to buy 10-12 of these.,0
ties inside,100% cotton! Yay!!!!!. This duvet set is a serious bubble gum girly pink.  After raising 5 kids and 25 years of marriage I am single and have seriously declared independence in my bedroom that is going seriously pastel! LOL.  The only problem with that is 2 small dogs who like to run in my muddy garden  but the cotton washes great and gets softer with every washing which is the thing I love most about cotton.  I love that this duvet has a zipper too!  The only drawback I’ve found and that will be super easy for me to fix since I sew is that the ties inside are made of a very cheap fabric in my opinion. They came a bit frayed  but next time I am at the local Joann’s Fabric store I will pick up some twill tape or other material to replace the ties. The big irony is that I currently have a mint colored comforter inside of the duvet as I recently moved and have not unpacked my duvet insert yet.  I also like the little girly ruffle that is on 3 sides of the comforter.  Yes  I am a 52 year old woman with a bubble gum pink duvet cover and I’m loving it!,0
never had a problem with the non-stick cookware peeling or pitting or scratching,Can't buy a better set of cookware anywhere!. Let me begin by saying I love Circulon cookware. My kitchen is a walking advertisement for it. It is designed for the cook  from the detailed handles that fit correctly in the palm of your hand to the way the pots clean up beautifully. I have never had a problem with the non-stick cookware peeling or pitting or scratching in anyway (unlike the Calphalon I have had in the past). Now specific to this set: This is the perfect housewarming or shower present for the bride to be. This set will last for years and will make even the most novice chef appear to be a professional on the first try out. There is every size in the set (perhaps with the exception of a really large stock pot) which a chef could ever need. Last weekend  I actually used almost the whole set simultaneously cooking an Italian dinner for my extended family  and I can assure you the set was well used  scraped and stirred for several courses. After the set was washed   it looked like I just took it out of the box. Circulon may be a little more pricey than some lower cost manufacturers. But it's the old adage  you get what you pay for. Circulon is simply the best!,1
unique gift,Great way to scrub and exfoliate!. I have been using scrubs in the shower for the past few years. I have really dry  crepey skin and scrubs really help. I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw these cubes  couldn't figure out if I would be able to control it in the shower (trying to get it onto my legs and arms). I was pleasantly surprised  however  to see how easy it was.  As I begin to use it the cube stays in the palm of my hand and begins to 'melt' slowly as I moved it up and down my arms and legs. There was plenty to go around and it was super easy to use. My skin felt amazing after just one use. I really did like the fragrance  too. I will be buying a few more of these for myself and also as stocking stuffers for my two daughter-in-laws (a unique gift). Highly recommend!,1
work on my windows 10,Doesn't work on my windows 10. Doesnt work with the joystick   very disappointed and I downloaded the game and can't use a mouse either?,0
easy to install,For the cost it's nice  but not enough for me. Bought for my 2021 Silverado Z71. It was easy to install and worked well enough. It looks like a $150 cover though. I just couldn't put it on such a nice truck and feel okay about it. I ended up with something much higher quality. If you want an easy cheap cover though  this is a good choice.,1
combat imbalanced,Good concept  but implementation falls flat. I bought this game based solely on the description on the box. I expected a game that had a trailing camera with good graphics  interesting combat  and an engaging storyline. I came away disappointed.  The most disappointing aspect of the game is the combat engine. Instead of a realtime hand-to-hand combat system  combat is turn-based. This in itself is not a problem. However  when engaged in combat  the participants run forward  take a swing  and run back. They take turns doing this until someone drops. The whole scenario comes across almost like a game of turn-based bumper cars.  Another issue with combat is the unexpected encounters that occur. In the opening stages of the game  the character must wander about in the woods  and very frequently the travel is interrupted by a message to prepare for combat. Often  that there are enemies nearby is a surprise as they do not show until the battle is joined. This kind of encounter occurs throughout the game.  Combat is often imbalanced as well. It is too easy to die.  The dialog options are somewhat uninspired as well  and the main character frequently talks to herself when trying to interact with inanimate objects. This is disconcerting  if nothing else.  There are good and bad aspects to the graphics. The graphics engine itself is good  and the rendered graphical images are very pretty and inspiring. There is plenty of eye candy in this game for those that like pretty graphics and lots of detail. However  one aspect of the graphics that is frustrating is the changing camera perspective. It switches automatically from a side view to a top-down view depending on area transitions  and in the top-down view it is difficult to tell where the player is going and what is in the surrounding area.  The storyline itself is engaging  and the developer did a nice job with it. Some of the side quests leave much to be desired  though  so it is a mixed bag in terms of gameplay.  If I had to compare it to other games in the same general genre  I would describe it as a hybrid mix between Dungeon Siege and Arcanum. Unfortunately it borrows a little too heavily from Arcanum's pitfalls.  I came away disappointed with this title. It has some good ideas and concepts that have been incorporated into it  but the implementation of those ideas make it less than ideal. Some players may find this game to be a refreshing change from 1st-person style gaming  but I found it to be clunky and awkward. I would recommend this title only to those who want to explore the storyline and are not too concerned about the implementation.,0
biased towards the west coast,Still not very good. I had a subscription to this magazine a few years ago. I let my sub run out because the magazine was not that good. I decided to give it another try and see if this magazine had improved. Nope  still the same old magazine. The gear reviews always seem to review the high end gear that only a small percentage of people can afford.   The articles are usually about hiking trails that are the top tier trails. PCT  AT  CDT  etc. How about some trails that are in different states that do not take MONTHS to finish! Some nice weekend trails would be awesome!! Seems like this magazine has always been biased towards the west coast. You know  there are many  many other trails in the US  across all 50 States!! Not just CA!  So  looks like this sub will be just like the first time I subbed. Going to let it expire. I can find better content on youtube anyways!,0
fabric is very lightweight,"Fun Top. This is a cute top for spring or summer. The fabric is very lightweight. The sleeves have a slight flutter that is flattering on the arm. There are functional buttons at the top. If you are a larger cup size  there may be gaps between these buttons. You can easily fix it with either a safety pin or a few stitches. I found the fit to be a bit on the small side. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the large.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
top 50 reviewer,touch and hold smooth dual door closer system. Husband purchased these to replace some others that had given up the ghost.  We live on the oceanfront and the salt takes a toll.  These are nice because you can do it with your foot (when install at the base of the door) just tap it and it stays open  tap again and it releases.  Easy Peasy.  He prefers these and says they are easy to install.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes.

Replacement would be nice,Grumbles. And here we have another product that I am still not thrilled with your hair and your hair is close to yourself and what happens when the plastic cap comes off the end and the metal snap and now you have a big chunk of metal poking you in the head yeah I'm not happy at all I have not even contacted the vendor because I don't want sound mean to them how upset I am with the quality that is not here. Replacement would be nice,0
stems,Nice range in colors  but flimsy shafts.. The package was nicely divided and orderly  and the array of colors/textures (flavors) is very delightful  says my cat. However  as I was affixing clasps to the feather spine shafts to make toys for my cat  they keep breaking with very little pressure applied by myself.  While I realize these are craft feathers  the stems should not be so fragile and hollow that they have very little support to last for whatever project they are being used for (you can crush them between two fingers very easily). That's the ONLY reason why I subtracted stars.,0
modern classic,modern classic. This movie is the first movie my family votes to watch every single holiday season.  My 75 year old Mother LOVES this movie and it's HER first pick too.  A silly story  but funny.  If you collect holiday movies  this will have to be one of them.,1
older version,This planner is an older version  be aware that it is for 2019. This is a nice planner  but it is older and will expire at the end of the year.  It is not a good value even if it was for this year and next.  It's basically a notebook with a calendar pages.  I would value it at no more than $12.,0
picture vs the contents,Disappointed. Was disappointed the picture vs the contents will try one more month too see. The Good thing though is who the the company is Thank you for protecting and keeping our country safe and for your service . Unbreakable,0
6 000 reviews,The dept of sensitive crimes. Purchased this for my 83 year old Mom  she loves the author.  This is a series in case you're interested in checking into it.

lightweight,Great  tetherless heating!. Recently I've been having extreme pain in my neck & was diagnosed with DDD. So  I began using an old school neck heating pad...you know the ones with the long cord. I wanted something that wasn't so stiff & conformed to my neck better...then I found this.  Not only does this conform nicely around my neck  but I can move around freely  while still providing the needed heat.  The design is great  lightweight & the power bank charges quickly.  I highly recommend this & will definitely be purchasing another for travel.,1
don't like it at all,Bad plastic nut. Doesn't fix.. Don't like it at all. Do not recommend.,0
fit runs a bit small,Runs a Bit Small. These are good leggings for all types of workouts. The fabric is very soft and stretchy. There's good tummy control. The waistband may roll down a bit while doing some exercises. The fit runs a bit small. I sized up for comfort.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,0
absorbent,Pampers are great diapers!. These diapers are great.  They are absorbent and lightly scented.  I've had no problems with leaking.,1
no flickering,pantry LED light. Very bright... easy for husband to install - but he does have a higher level electrical ability... We installed in a small walk in pantry about 4'x4' and it lights up the enter area nicely.  The light is white... not yellow looking.  No flickering.  Should last for many years. Measurements provided are accurate.  I will update my review though  should new info seem useful.,1
too small for any real purpose,Don't Waste Your Time Or Money. It's rinky dink  as in too small for any real purpose. I'd gotten this thinking it would keep the headphones attached to me  and that's not happening. It doesn't grip the cable securely at all (rather flimsy). And therefore it is of no use to me  and I plan on sending it back and getting a refund.,0
trying to find fun things to do safely at home,detector wand. Additional purchase to add to the kid detectors I purchased for my 6 and 9 year old grandsons.  Works exactly as it should.  In this time of the virus when we are trying to find fun things to do safely at home - this wand and the detectors have been just the thing - along with pirate booty that my husband buried before the boys arrived.  It's been great.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
single project that I wanted to jump up and do,Redundant glad I bout at a discounted price. I didn’t find this to live up to its name. Nothing really new or inspiring. Didn’t find a single project that I wanted to jump up and do and found the issues repetitive. Havind said all that  I will note that if your cash flow is better than mine you may find it more to your liking but I’m definitely a design on a dime type who loves repurposing salvage and the likes. To each their own! Just not my bag.,0
superior,An excellent personal monitor for vocalists - compares favorably to the Mackie SRM150. I purchased this to augment our guitarist/vocalist's vocals as both an enhancer and as a personal monitor. I am going to directly compare this to a [[ASIN:B003552MFI Mackie SRM150 5.25-Inch Compact Active PA System]] and a [[ASIN:B008O0RKVA TC Helicon Mic Mechanic]]  both of which I also own.  The Mackie is close to the same form factor as this  but lacks the vocal and effects features that this incorporates. Since it's in the same price range it's an apples-to-apples comparison. In fact  I want to disagree with reviews that bemoan that this is cheaply made because for the price it has about the same build quality as the Mackie (and the almost identical Behringer personal monitor). The connectors  buttons and switches are about equal among them all.  This is louder than the Mackie  and with the effects and vocal enhancements is  in my opinion  superior. However  if you already own a Mackie (or the Behringer)  I strongly recommend getting the Mic Mechanic instead because the range of tweaking that device allows is vastly superior to the controls on this VoiceSolo.  Instead of me boring you with opinions and details  I recommend that you check out the VoiceSolo FX150 Video Manual that TC Helicon has posted on YouTube. That  more than the reviews here  is what convinced me to takea chance on this as both a personal monitor and vocal enhancer  and I am glad I did because this is worth every penny in my opinion.,1
okay,Two Stars. It gets boring after a while.. But it's okay..,1
FULL POTENCY,LOTS OF ALLERGIES AND BEST Essential Oils I Ever Bought.. I bought this set last June and just opened it now. The fact that the oils are SO fresh upon opening nine months later says a lot.  A few things you have to understand:  The negative review about allergy upon skin contact is only ONE case. As someone with a ton of skin sensitivities and contact dermatitis  I also got a tiny bit itchy with mixing the orange  lemongrass and rosemary onto my skin but THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. These are 100% essential oil  NOT mixed with any kind of carrier. If you go to Whole Foods and buy one of the AuraCacia oils  many are mixed with jojoba oil so that they are easier on skin. Yes  they also have a line of 100% essential oils but these are a much better value. These are FULL POTENCY and VOLATILE which means yes  they *can* burn skin and SHOULD NOT be used on or around pets (do research as I know some oils are poisonous to cats). Any full potency oil can be extremely toxic to children if ingested. If you are making a batch of homemade lotion  DIY sanitizers or whatever else  you add like 4-5 drops for every CUP of product. More than that is going to be way too much. That said  this is actually a REALLY great value for this entire set. And non-GMO  Organic?!!! AMAZING.,0
apply 3 times a day,Less sweat  dried feet. I am on the fence about this product.  It states to apply 3 times a day at first.  Who has time for that?  I did apply at least twice a day.  For the first few days  it did nothing.  After repeated use  it started to help decrease the sweating of my feed.  It does state this in the directions.  It dries the feet out  which I guess is the point  but aesthetically speaking  it doesn’t look great.  I want nice looking feet   not over dried looking.  The bottle is pretty small .  It lasted about a month.  I did buy another bottle  so I could really decide whether I liked it or not.  I am still deciding whether to buy another or not.  Don’t like how my feet look when using it  but I like having less sweaty feet.  I am wondering how it would work if just used during exercise  when the sweating is worse.,0
stick collapses,Don’t waste your money.. Every time I go to use it the stick collapses and will not hold the extension length. This product is very frustrating. This is a simple solution that I was hoping the product would resolve but it doesn’t.,0
Pumpkin Spice Latte smells pretty good,Smells Awful  Not Worth the Money. The only reason this even gets two stars is that the Pumpkin Spice Latte actually smells pretty good. Other than that  this set is horrible. The pumpkin cupcake scent isn't good. It doesn't smell anything even close to a cupcake or pumpkin spice. It's more of the artificial cinnamon smell and even that's not good. Also  I don't get why it's a light pink when it's supposed to be pumpkin cupcake but that's not even the issue. This scent was awful and gave me a huge headache. Do not like it at all. I do really like the Pumpkin Latte though as it has a very nice pumpkin spice smell with a hint of vanilla that levels it out. It isn't highly scented but my warmer is in a small room and the smell is nice and I can smell it nicely in that room. I can't however smell it anywhere else throughout the house  which is a shame. I use many different waxes from all types of companies and usually  I can smell the scent  even faintly  throughout the house  not with this one though. I still really like the scent though  and it wouldn't hurt for it to be tripled scented than what it is now. The pumpkin spice scent is okay. It isn't horrible but it isn't that great either. It doesn't have a lot of fragrance and doesn't last but only a few hours if that. Overall these were some of the worst wax cubes that I have bought and I DO NOT recommend these at all. If they changed the scents and added more scents to these  then maybe that would make these better but as they are right now  I will NEVER buy these again. I would much rather spend the money and get Scenty wax melts.,1
pricey,Fair. First time I purchased this brand. A little too pricey to buy again,0
introduction by founding patron,"Recipes from the world's best-loved Jewish chefs  proceeds go to charity = win-win!. It is no secret that food plays an enormous part in Jewish identity and celebration. Gefiltefest is a British Jewish food charity whose mission is to bring people together to explore the relationship between Judaism and food  educating and enthusing them about all aspects of Jewish food including food heritage  ethics  culture and traditions. The charity is proud to be at the forefront of Britain's Jewish food movement and stages a hugely popular annual festival.  To coincide with the 2014 festival  Gefiltefest has produced its first-ever Jewish cookbook. This engaging book includes contributions from well-known Ashkenazi and Sephardi chefs and food writers from around the globe. Over a three-year period  more than 65 chefs donated recipes  including Poopa Dweck ([[ASIN:0060888180 Aromas of Aleppo: The Legendary Cuisine of Syrian Jews]])  Jamie Geller ([[ASIN:0062207822 Joy of Kosher: Fast  Fresh Family Recipes]])  Joyce Goldstein ([[ASIN:0811819698 Cucina Ebraica: Flavors of the Italian Jewish Kitchen]])  Deborah Madison  Joan Nathan ([[ASIN:0375402764 Jewish Cooking in America: Expanded Edition (Knopf Cooks American)]])  Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi ([[ASIN:1607743949 Jerusalem: A Cookbook]])  Claudia Roden ([[ASIN:0394532589 The Book of Jewish Food: An Odyssey from Samarkand to New York]])  Gil Marks ([[ASIN:0684835592 The WORLD OF JEWISH COOKING: More Than 500 Traditional Recipes from Alsace to Yemen]])  Tina Wasserman ([[ASIN:0807411108 Entree to Judaism: A Culinary Exploration of the Jewish Diaspora]])  Paula Wolfert ([[ASIN:0061957550 The Food of Morocco]]) and Orly Ziv ([[ASIN:9659207107 Cook in Israel: Home Cooking Inspiration]]). This unique cookbook features their favorite recipes  encouraging the use of seasonal produce. The proceeds from the compilation will be donated to Gefiltefest  the only British charity that has Jewish culinary tradition as its primary focus and believes in proudly enjoying Jewish heritage and keeping culinary traditions alive.  The book begins with an introduction by founding patron Claudia Roden and a foreword on ""Being refined  heimische and hygienic: Early Jewish cookery books"" by Maureen Kendler. Beginning with starters  soups  salads  light dishes and dips  you'll find familiar elements like borscht on the rocks (dairy or parve) and chicken soup with handmade egg noodles alongside Sephardic and Middle Eastern dishes like smoky eggplant salad with garlic and parsley  Moroccan orange and olive salad  tabouleh-couscous vegetable salad and Paula Wolfert's Tunisian couscous with fennel  red peppers and garlic. There are many delicious ""upscale"" salads that have made it into frequent rotation in my kitchen  particularly Tina Wasserman's arugula salad with dates and chevre and Evelyn Rose's chicory and frisee salad with blue cheese  croutons and pecans.  Mains offer a variety of stellar chicken dishes like Simi Goldberg's roasted paprika chicken  white rice with nut and raisin topping and the Italian Jewish chicken with tomatoes  olives  herbs and red wine  while lamb dishes also get ample coverage (sumac rack of lamb with fattoush salad  Greek lamb stew with romaine lettuce and dill  spring lamb casserole). As I am pescetarian  I particularly loved the fish offerings  particularly the salmon with noodles and leeks  oodles of spring onions with cod in a ginger and soy sauce  deconstructed sushi salad platter  and dill salmon. Fellow vegetarians will also find much to enjoy  such as the pumpkin  spinach and feta frittata with piperade  caprese latkes  springtime risotto  veggie bakes  and the amazing egg-stuffed crispy brik pastry with feta  caramelized shallots and spinach served with date syrup and a herb salad. (Note that veggie dishes are listed under ""mains"" and there is not a separate veggie section.)  Desserts offer a festive assortment of Eastern European favorites like strudel  compote  babka  kugel  lekach  rugelach  and cheesecake alongside Middle Eastern sweets like cornes de gazelle filled with marzipan  orange and anise glazed sweet potato sfinge  stewed black grapes and Greek yoghurt  and Syrian apricot compote in rosewater syrup.  Each recipe is labeled dairy  meaty  or parve  and ingredients are given in metric and volume. There is a brief introduction by each author to the origin of a given recipe  sometimes including bits of family history as well. The recipes are delicious  unfussy  and include a wide range of culinary influences from the Jewish diaspora  and it is wonderful to hear from so many well-known Jewish chefs in a single place (I own many of their individual cookbooks). There are the occasional full-color photos  but not for every recipe. I appreciated the fact that the book is printed on high-quality matte pages  so glare is not an issue. I also liked the page layout being broken up by blocks of color (green horizontal bars for the recipe title  the contributing author's name in a red vertical bar on the page edge).  Overall  the Gefiltefest Cookbook is a wonderful addition to your cookbook collection  not only for the recipes but for the fact that proceeds go to charity. More info on Gefiltefest can be found at www.gefiltefest.org.  (Thank you to Gefiltefest and Grub Street for the review copy!)",1
size smaller than expected,Beautiful Quality Pearl  But A Little Smaller Than Same Size Class From Same Company. I have always wanted to have a pearl necklace.  Although it is not my usual style  I thought I would try one out.  The problem is that I did not have any earrings appropriate to wear with it.  That is where these came in.  HOW THESE ARE PACKAGED This is a beautiful set very appropriate for gift giving.  It comes in a cardboard sheath.  Inside there is a very beautiful blue box with a nice expensive looking finish on it.  Inside the box there is a plastic bag with a pair of earrings  silicone backs on them  extra backs  a white velvet bag  and a cleaning cloth.  QUALITY The earring pearls are beautiful in tone and quality.  They are shiny as you can see from the photo.  The camera reflection is showing on the pearl.  The tone of the pearl is what I call a rose taupe tint to it.  It is very slight  but it is warm and beautiful.  SIZE The size of these is not quite as big as I hoped it would be.  My necklace is from the same company and the color matches perfectly   but the size although listed as the same is bigger on the necklace.  Nevertheless  it looks good together and I am happy with it.  THE BOTTOM LINE This set of earrings is really nice.  It is good quality  well packaged  and a decent price.  MY RATING FIVE STARS.  Although I wish they were just a tiny bit larger  I still like them very much and the color is stunning.,0
cannot pronounce the name of the company,Cheap cheap cheap cheap material. This does not look as full and vibrant as the picture! This is poorly constructed and entirely not flattering to anybody type! The material is so thin that you can see right through it and the feel of it just makes you break out in a rash just by looking at it before you even put it on. This is grotesque and if you cannot pronounce the name of the company you should not buy!,0
heavy chewers,Made in USA. My dogs love treats and toys but are heavy chewers. It’s difficult to find long lasting treat and chews. They seemed to enjoy the chews but we’re short lived. No foul odor or less. Made in USA and worth a try.,1
wonderful little pen,Great little pen. Wonderful little pen   it’s making my penmanship better and you can actually read my writing now. I love theses and never want to run out on them.,1
too pricey,Three Stars. I cancelled the subscription as is too pricey.,0
no full refund on returns,Don't bother. Bypass this option for an American company version. It was very disappointing  inaccurately described  and no full refund on returns.,0
easy to go about your day,Refreshing!. I like wearing eye masks such as these. They are refreshing and energizing. I store them in my small beauty refrigerator which makes them even more enjoyable. After wearing them  I felt ready to take on the world! It comes with a little spatula so you can take them out of the jar without touching them. It felt like they were slipping as I wore them  but when I went to the bathroom to remove them  they were still in place where I left them. One thing I like about this type of eye mask is that it's easy to go about your day while wearing them. I didn't have any issues with sensitivity thankfully. My eyes are super sensitive.,1
clasp is solid,Perfect for crafts. I can't tell you how perfect this box is for crafts! The handle is sturdy  the clasp is solid and doesn't feel like it's going to come undone and spill everything  and the compartments are nice and big. I do beadwork  and while I love to see all the beads I have  it's more craft-efficient to choose which ones to use and set them aside to use. I put the project's beads in this container to use  and it's a much better use of space. I have only the ones I want out for me to use  rather than all my (hundreds? thousands?) beads in the way. HIGHLY recommended!,1
Amalfi sage chicken,“There is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”. Susie Fishbein’s bestselling series “Kosher By Design” goes out with a bang with the final ninth volume “Kosher By Design Brings It Home.” Inspired by Susie’s travels to France  Italy  Mexico  Israel  and North America  you’ll find kosher versions of favorites such as Korean short ribs  lasagna bolognaise  and shoyu tamago ramen (which normally has a pork-based broth here in Japan).  I have several kosher cookbooks that I cook from regularly (Including The Joy of Kosher and “The New Kosher”)  but this was my first experience with the “Kosher By Design” series.  The menu leans most heavily towards Israeli and Italian dishes  including staples like arancini (fried stuffed risotto)   ravioli  Tuscan bean and farro soup  veal scallopini  brachiole  (fried) pizza Napolitana  ragu Napolitano  and lasagna  but you’ll also find Asian-inspired dishes (short ribs  spicy kim chee hangar steaks   ramen  chicken adobo) and Latin flair in the form of chicken flautas  ceviche  and pulled beef tacos.  The salads and dairy / fish sections were particular favorites of mine. I love light  refreshing salads for nearly every meal  and the Israeli-inspired salads here are perfect for hot  hazy days when you don’t feel like spending hours at the stove. I loved the Provencal wheatberry salad  Lumina market salad  Carmel Spa pomegranate almond salad (I use pomegranate molasses as a salad dressing and was happy to see it in a recipe!)  kale squash Caesar salad  root vegetable apple salad  and Chedva’s warm French potato salad was a revelation: baby potatoes  haricots verts  and a tangy white wine-herb dressing made this memorable (to make it dairy  you can add crumbled feta while warm).  Poultry includes rosemary lavender chicken  Amalfi sage chicken  and mustard caper chicken  and the meat dishes include various roasts  grills  and stews: pumpkin braised short ribs are perfect for fall  while the lamb cholent “cassoulet” reminded me of my trip to France’s Perigord in 2012. Dairy dishes include decadent bread pudding  farroto  pasta frittata  and risotto  while the fish dishes really shone: I loved the silan-glazed salmon (see photo) and the showstopping citrus-glazed salmon  layered with rows of perfectly symmetrical cucumber slices atop a citrus mayo. I also enjoyed trying my hand at the khachapuri shakshuka having taught many students from Georgia  I’d long heard of the magic of khachapuri but had never tried making it before. Susie’s clear instructions (and the easy shakshuka topping save the extra for omelettes and scrambled eggs!) make this a winner for breakfast or brunch.  Vegetarians have many options in the sides chapter  including a beautiful (and deceptively simple) eggplant and tomato tart (see photo)  tershi and couscous (I’m a fan of all things pumpkin and had not heard / tried this amazing Libyan Jewish dish before)  sweet potato wontons with teriyaki dipping sauce  chestnut tomato quinoa  and freekeh pilaf. Desserts are sure to tempt with a delightfully sweet/tart lemon tiramisu  Beresheet Spa Kanafe  banana  date  and pecan cake  almond bobka ring  halvah baklava  and fudgy New Fishbein Brownies punched up with espresso powder. Recipes are clearly labeled as meat  dairy or pareve (with some having multiple options depending on dairy-free substitutions) using color-coded icons. Note that some spellings use the Hebrew / Ashkenazi variations (chummos for hummus  seviche for ceviche  bobka for babka  etc.). I love that the font is a little larger and easily readable from several feet away as I tend to cook using a cookbook holder (and the ingredients are handily in bold). Each recipe comes with a full-page photo by John Uher showcasing each dish. The recipes (main dishes in particular) tend to be more elegant / upscale than some of my other kosher cookbooks (dishes like dried fruit and quinoa stuffed capons  turkey breast with hoisin tangerine glaze  and pumpkin braised short ribs would all make wonderful holiday centerpieces)  but there are also plenty of recipes that come together quickly for weeknight meals (the eggplant and tomato tart  fish dishes  and veggie sides).  Overall  “Kosher by Design Brings It Home” is a wonderful finale to Susie’s best-selling series (with nearly 500 000 books sold) and a great way to taste the world from the comfort of your (kosher) kitchen Susie’s headnotes introduce the reader to places and people she’s encountered on her fifteen-year culinary journey spanning several continents and multiple food traditions  from Italian nonnas to Yemenite family recipes passed down across generations. But at the end of the day  in Susie’s words  “there is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”  (Thank you to the Trina Kaye Organization for the review copy!),1
does the job,Good basketball pump. Good pump and got it at a great price. It does the job and pumps up balls.  The needle conveniently stores in the handle which is great. It also comes with an attachment to blow balloons up too!,1
outstanding debut novel,Outstanding debut novel!. I absolutely LOVED this book!  I was looking to fill a gap after finishing eight books of the Outlander series and when I saw this one on NetGalley I knew I had to ask for an ARC. I cannot thank NetGalley and the publishers enough for giving me a copy as I loved every minute of this book.  The author moves seamlessly between two time periods (1917 and 2017) without ever losing the pace of the story or confusing the reader. At the heart of the book is a love story but what I also appreciated about the book is the historical aspect of it all. Catherine Taylor has obviously done her research! I don’t want to give anything away with regards to the plot as I don’t want to spoil it for potential readers so all I can say is if you are a fan of Diana Gabaldon  Kristin Hannah  Kate Morton  Ken Follett et al  then this is a book for your to-read list!  I cannot wait to read more of Catherine Taylor's work as if this outstanding debut is anything to go by  she is an author to watch!,1
WWII,"Might better be called  ""love  hate  and treasure"". But this book is a treasure.  Readers interested in WWII and the aftermath will especially appreciate it's somewhat different take on the period immediately following the war.  Aside from the fact that it's simply a very good read  it gives a slightly less black and white picture of the times  especially the attitude toward Jews of not only the Nazis  but many of the Allies as well.  Going back and forth in time and featuring different characters  each layer adds to the picture  until the mystery is unraveled.  But don't expect a happy ending with all the knots unraveled.",1
great quality set,Comfortable. Great quality set. Perfect for working out or lounging. Love the color and thickness of the material. I normally wear a small or medium and the medium fit perfectly. Love the tie waist and ribbed texture.,1
side stitching poor,Comfortable  “barely there” bandeau perfect for light post-surgery compression stitching poor. I tried this in a large to extra  extra  extra large and all the sizes in-between and these bras fit me perfectly in any of those sizes without much difference in feel or tightness. I got these to help reduce swelling after surgery and this is working perfectly for me. I also love the lilac color. Unfortunately  this one arrived with very poor side stitching. It looks like someone sewed the sides by hand as can be seen from the photo. Other than this  they are the same as every other one I ordered.  Note that they wash well in a lingerie bag but I lay them flat to dry.,0
gum massaging nubs,"Excellent infant teether with gum massaging nubs drop resistant. There is one BPA-free silicone teether in this package. The silicone is super soft. I consider this cute and engaging. This is easy for the baby to grab and hold onto. It has no sharp edges or parts that can fall off. This is perfect as a teether and is one solid piece. I also love that the ears have nubs which act as a gum massaging / tooth cleaning ""tool."" As is typical  always supervise when the baby is using this. This is rated for 0 to 12 months.  This is made in China. The current price of $6.29 ($6.99 minus 10%) is competitively priced for this. Overall  I consider this a great teether that is drop resistant and small enough for newborns. I had given one like this to my neighbor's infant and he absolutely loved it.",1
liked it,Ok. The bristles do exfoliate my skin  and there is a noticeable difference of softness afterwards  but the bristles also break/cut my sensitive skin. I have attached a photo. I received a few of these marks at different places on my body after using the product. This is my first time using this type of product. I liked it but think I need something else.,1
hard,Very small.. I was looking forward to receiving these brackets.  But  they are too small to use.  I do not have a broad face  big nose  chin  or big head.  These do not cover my nose and chin at the same time.  They are more for a child’s face.  It’s too much of a bother to send them back so I’ll be giving them to my son for the grandchildren. I have 3 different cloth masks and they don’t work with any of them.  They move around  possibly because they’re so small.  Also  being silicon  I expected them to be at least a bit softer but they are hard.  Very disappointed.,0
lightly spiced,Good beef jerky  excellent lightly spiced  perfect for snacking. Great not-overly-spicy beef jerky. Perfect size for packing in my lunch bag for a mid afternoon snack. This is definitely one of my favorites. I did deduct a star because even though the flavor was great  I did find this pack a little on the dry side. I am going to order another package before month end and if I find the next package to be better  I will be adding to this review and changing it to a 5 star. My brother and nephew really love this jerky  too  and have been eating it for years  so I know it's got to be good!,1
exceeded my expectations by 200%,This cart will absolutely exceed your expectations!. This cart exceeded my expectations by 200% even at the $169 price tag.  It is designed to work hard and not break.  It’s built like a tank  I have no doubt about the 400 lb load rating. The larger wheels easily go up/down stairs and curbs.  I expect this cart to last a very long time.  One cool feature is that when the cart is closed and the wheels are folded up  if you hold it vertically  the wheels are slightly below the platform and roll.  This comes in handy if you don’t have any cargo and you’re have limited access  you can close the cart and roll it instead of carrying it.  You won’t be disappointed with this cart!,1
"""earth"" scent","Great non alcoholic nose burn when you smell it!. I love how different this smells on everyone. It shows a male jumping up on the box but I honestly think it could be for everyone. It is not a ""perfume "" scent.. It is an ""earth"" scent. On me  a female  it smells like a woodsy outdoorsy scent..one my 18 yr old grson he described it as an ""earthy orange"" scent!  The bottle is a clear blue that reminds you of the ocean..which is great because the name is ""sea""  I really love this unusual scent!",1
not very strong,Good brightness levels  battery life is really good. clip a bit weak.. After trying/owning other portable  battery-operated lights & lamps  have to say this is my favorite for its reliable output of light and its sturdiness. Its battery life is pretty good too. The only thing I wish were better is the 'clip'. Depending on the surface its attached to  it does not always hold well. It (clip) is small but also rather bulky and not very strong to give good support to the bulkiness of the light.,0
"""love and desire""","Interesting twists on dance/electronic. I first heard of Parisian DJ David Guetta (a fixture in Ibiza and Paris) on the ""Pioneer: The Album Vol. 3"" while living in Spain (Ibiza CDs are EVERYWHERE) with his fabulous single ""Love Don't Let Me Go."" After a long wait  ""Just A Little More Love"" is being released in North America---it's ABOUT TIME!!!. His album is a pleasing blend of styles and moods  all of it intensely danceable. The main highlight for me was not only Guetta's fantastic mixing  but the soulful  searing vocals by gospel phenom Chris Willis (backing vocalist for Amy Grant  CeCe Winans  Twilla Paris  Garth Brooks  and Dolly Parton among others) that made the album come alive. ""Just A Little More Love"" sounds like a throwback to the heyday of the `80s  with elements of funk and disco scattered throughout the driving beats. The album spawned a number of singles  including Ibiza megahit ""Love Don't Let Me Go."" This North American release features an altered tracklist from the European debut  adding the Just For One Day (Heroes) remix from Guetta's new album F*** Me I'm Famous (named after an Ibiza tradition)  cuts several others (Chris Willis' You  Atomic Food)  and substitutes edits for several (Just a Little More Love Elektro edit  Distortion vocal edit  Just a Little More Love Wally Lopez remix edit). The majority of the thirteen songs are vocal-driven  with the exception of 133 and Lately  both instrumentals. Themes range from the noble: social reform (Can't U Feel The Change)  self-empowerment (It's Alright)  love and desire (the campy Sexy 17  People Come  People Go  Give Me Something  the riveting Love Don't Let Me Go  You Are The Music) and just plain fun (Distortion). This North American release is much more geared for club play with the addition of Just For One Day and the edits/remixes. A danceable feast for the ears and refreshingly original. Remember to check out Guetta's new album F*** Me I'm Famous as well.",1
individually wrapped disposable cloths,Surprisingly this works well to remove my cream eye make-up. I tried many different make-up remover products and have always been disappointed because they never remove what they say it will remove and I have to use a ton of solution or wipes. However  these surprisingly work. I used this to remove cream eyeshadow and it did a wonderful job. In addition  my lids felt moisturized. Note each cloth is infused with Vitamin E and Aloe.  There are 10 (I received 11) individually wrapped disposable cloths in each package. They come loosely packaged in an envelope  so I have to put them in a zip lock bag to store.  At the current price of 9.50 ($10 minus 5%)  it comes to $.95 cents per remover cloth. I certainly would not make a steady diet of these since they are expensive  but they are perfect for that once-in-awhile situation where one needs to remove their make-up without soap and water. ,1
happy,great. very  nice  bags   elegant  look  and  excellent  packing in  its  own  wrapped  box.  I  have  purchased  again  and  you  will  be  happy,1
washes great,100% cotton! Yay!!!!!. This duvet set is a serious bubble gum girly pink.  After raising 5 kids and 25 years of marriage I am single and have seriously declared independence in my bedroom that is going seriously pastel! LOL.  The only problem with that is 2 small dogs who like to run in my muddy garden  but the cotton washes great and gets softer with every washing which is the thing I love most about cotton.  I love that this duvet has a zipper too!  The only drawback I’ve found and that will be super easy for me to fix since I sew is that the ties inside are made of a very cheap fabric in my opinion. They came a bit frayed  but next time I am at the local Joann’s Fabric store I will pick up some twill tape or other material to replace the ties. The big irony is that I currently have a mint colored comforter inside of the duvet as I recently moved and have not unpacked my duvet insert yet.  I also like the little girly ruffle that is on 3 sides of the comforter.  Yes  I am a 52 year old woman with a bubble gum pink duvet cover and I’m loving it!,1
supports very well,This is very supportive. I do find it is a little snug  but it's supports very well.  I can't say if the copper does anything extra or not  but it is definitely snug and compresses.,1
There's not a thing bad about it.,Bowie Pulls Out All the Stops. Space Oddity is a MUST HAVE in just about any audiophile's library.  David Bowie pulls out all the stops in this album.  There's not a thing bad about it.,1
cotton,Nice cotton and fit. Husband loves it,1
love the way this case feels,great case. LOVE this case!! I love the way this case feels and it’s very durable but flexible!,1
chewier,Not bad  prefer Tums. I rated this as 3 stars. Taste was good  not crazy about the consistency. Maybe I am just used to the consistency (chalky) of Tums. These seemed a little chewier  These are also way over priced for what I consider almost a no-name brand. I would prefer to get the generic at CVS for a lot less.,0
contacted the manufacturer,Contains a poisonous toxic chemical formaldehyde. I am highly allergic to formaldehyde   it cause me to be dizzy. Have headaches   watering eyes. Sore throat. I had all these things after using this hair condition one time. I read the remarks  and another person asked Amazon if there was formaldehyde in it  and they referred this person to the manufacturer. Located in Hong Kong   they gave the person the run around on the answer. And never did admit it. It is illegal to put it into anything here in the US. I was exposed to it through 2 different sets of sheets and one face cream. And now this hair conditioner. Ive contacted the manufacturer   but I doubt I'll hear from them!!,0
whirlpool dryers usually have more than this wrong with it,Quality Blower wheel. Same  blower wheel that you pay a lot more for elsewhere.  Great product at a great price.  But these whirlpool dryers usually have more than this wrong with it so be prepared to need more stuff  at least this helps with the cost of fixing these dryers with reasonable prices.,0
toss it around at the window,Great car toy. I got this for my toddler to play with in the car and she's really loving it. If she decides to toss it around  at the window or her big sister  it's not going to hurt anything. Cheap entertainment that doesn't involve a screen,0
"""pulled my hair""",Chums original. Work exactly as they should.  I put them on a pair of Oakly's that had rubber temples and pulled my hair ALLLLL the time.  Sliding these on clipping off the ends of the chums  (I know.. not exactly the right application - but what the heck).  NO more hair pulling.  Love it.,0
not a plumber,worked great. I am not a plumber  so the chance of me botching this was about 100%. I didn't I would like to thank the academy  and mostly EasyDrain  for helping me renovate my girlfriends 1930's plumbing in her bathroom like a champ.,0
full viewing capability,Really nice full face snorkel mask!. I have never tried a full face snorkel mask before (used to only covering my eyes with a foggy mask and have pipe which goes in my mouth). This was a little awkward to get used to but now I really like it. It fits well  no leaks  not overly constrictive on my face and I can snorkel for hours. I love the full viewing capability I get with this full face mask and I also love that it is GoPro compatible (I am planning to buy a GoPro camera in September when I go to the Caribbean). I will update this review to speak to the GoPro matching capability after I return. But  for a snorkel mask  this is really a great one!,1
Beautiful,Five Stars. Beautiful  just what I wanted.,1
twice as thick,portable charger. I bought this to replace a thin  credit card battery bank.  This one is twice as thick about the same overall size - but it has more battery power.  So it's a trade off.  I like it right now.  It's still small enough to fit in my very small purse or travel backpack.  Having said all of that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
price is right,It IS Perfect!!. I'm 62 and love this primer. That's why I'm here searching for more. If the price is right I may pick up a couple more for stocking stuffers.,1
screen cracked,NOT A GOOD CASE TO PROTECT MY NEW S20+ ULTRA. Not a good case!  My phone fell 2x and both times my screen cracked.  I just bought a new case and screen protectors to cover the cracks.,0
includes cica solution,Very nice makeup removal pads. These are nice makeup removal pads. You get a jar with 70 of these pads that are soaked with the removal solution. And of course when you are done there is some of that solution on the bottom that you can use with regular cotton pads. These makeup pads are very nice and work well. The removal solution is very gentle  probably because it includes cica solution in it as well as some vitamins and other good ingredients.  They smell very good and I found are gentle enough to use around the eyes. I had no issues removing foundation  lipsticks are eye makeup. All in all I am very happy with these. The price is rather reasonable too at $12 for 70 of these pads. I think these should be good for sensitive people except may the fragrance that is fairly strong but pleasant. But since these are gentle enough to use around the eyes they should be good for sensitive skin.,1
reviews,The dept of sensitive crimes. Purchased this for my 83 year old Mom  she loves the author.  This is a series in case you're interested in checking into it.  I think it is actually #1 of 3 (?).  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - nearly 6 000 reviews posted  viewed over 50 000 times  and over 24 000 likes.,1
brush is hefty and is one solid piece,Good  hefty brush but short handle massaging side not useful to me. I tried several brushes over the last several months and love the KOZIS Wooden Bath Brush (Amazon item # B08HR2GBHC) the best. However  this one is very good too.  The brush head side is ample for good coverage. The bristles are of medium softness. The massaging side is not useful to me because I have no desire to use that. In fact  I do not even understand why anyone would use that.   The brush is hefty and is one solid piece  which is fabulous as the head cannot fall off the handle like some other brushes I tried previously. It also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower. In addition  a self-stick hook is supplied if needed but I did not use it.  Besides the massaging brush head that I find useless  the only negative to me is that the brush handle is about two inches shorter than I would like. Many brushes have a longer handle and a longer handle is best when trying to reach my back. Nevertheless  this is still very functional and it is very well made.  Overall  I like this brush even though it comes in second to the KOZIS I love. The current price of $11.99 is about right for a two-sided wooden brush.,1
Chemical scent,Chemical scent. Didn't care for the scent. Almost bitter,0
not happy at all,Grumbles. And here we have another product that I am still not thrilled with your hair and your hair is close to yourself and what happens when the plastic cap comes off the end and the metal snap and now you have a big chunk of metal poking you in the head yeah I'm not happy at all I have not even contacted the vendor because I don't want sound mean to them how upset I am with the quality that is not here. Replacement would be nice,0
durable,Great medium flex guitar pics. I was playing PRS mediums and they kept breaking. These .73 Dunlap picks are more durable. I played a festival gig today   like 30 songs and they retained their flex and didn't break. Bravo.,1
does nothing like stated,Another bad design.. Forget it! It does nothing like stated. Just gets in the way!,0
flashlight,Dewalt Max Lithium-Ion 4 tool set. My husband is a project manager.  Uses Dewalt tools every day and for many  many years.  While this kit is NOT the most powerful tools Dewalt offers  he says that they are perfectly fine for home use.  Further he believes that the tool bag is worth it's weight in gold.  It keeps tools readily available and is handy to use in carrying the tools to your project area.  I have to admit most of the men I've seen looking over the tools are ooing and ahing over the actual tool bag.  We purchased this on &#34Prime Sale Day&#34 and my husband believes that we paid a fair sale price.  While it wasn't a &#34steal&#34 it was well worth the money spent.  Everything listed was included... and interestingly the piece that my husband thought he would not use much has turned out to be the most used at this time - the flashlight!  The tools are fairly heavy pieces so I am not sure I will be used them as a girl (ha) but they are certainly doable.  I always update my reviews if new info would be helpful.  Finally  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.,1
circulation-cuttingly tight,Nice product  sizing off!. Product is well made  but sizing seems way off for women. I purchased the XS for women's size 6  and they are so tight that my toes are bent under and the ankle opening is unbearably  circulation-cuttingly tight. They looked like doll's socks  for real. Sent them back for a size small instead. My husband's XL fit perfectly for his size 10.5 shoes! Snug  but not uncomfortably so.,0
on and off switch would be preferable,battery sleeping kitty. [[VIDEOID:c33aceda60ff5d241b2b5fd1408c94f]] UPDATED REVIEW BELOW...I have to say this little kitten is just simply adorable.  She is silent until you get your ear directly over her... then it sounds like really purring.  She is delightful.  Even my husband thought she was adorable.  I have serious pet allergies and this seemed like a little comfort without the allergic reaction. I am surprised at how realistic it looks and feels.  Now  you won't really want to &#34cuddle&#34 her.... she is a bit stiff  particularly on the bottom.  But you could hold her in your lap and pat her.  She comes with a lovely pet bed  a wooden backed brush and the cardboard box she comes in converts into a pet carrier if you'd like.  There is an adoption form to fill out if you'd like.  She takes 1 D cell battery... and yes  the battery box is screwed down. There is a slight chemically odor when you first open it.. but it dissipates quickly. Didn't notice within a few hours of opening.  I included a video so you can get a better feel for it.  I feel like it was worth every penny!  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful and I never shy away from responding to comments and/or questions. Further  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind.  My purchases are VERIFIED  100% full price  independent purchases.  You can trust that my reviews are 100% independent and are my opinion.  Which may differ from yours.  Happy shopping to all! UPDATE:  8/29/2016..... While I still like my little kitty  she has developed a &#34mechanical sound&#34 while &#34breathing&#34.... too bad.... wishing wishing wishing the quality was better.  When I get annoyed by the sound I have to take the battery out... as others have said  an on and off switch would be preferable than screw down battery case. Just a little disappointed. UPDATE: 10/30/2016.... I have had this little kitty for a couple of months and she is still going - no battery changes yet.  The &#34mechanical sound&#34 sort of comes and goes... My 5 year old grandson is really enamored of her.  He brushes her and coos to her that she is &#34sooo cute.&#34  So.  That's worth it  right?  It is oddly soothing to have it just sitting there... &#34breathing.&#34  I do wish there was an on and off switch and the quality would allow quiet  non mechanical sounds...and maybe softer so you could actually snuggle it.,0
springform pan,Make showstopping desserts on your countertop with minimal effort!. I’m a fairly recent convert to the slow cooker bandwagon I only purchased my first slow cooker a couple of years ago and started out by baking my way through all the desserts in Michele Scicolone’s excellent “The Mediterranean Slow Cooker ” which introduced me to the joys of making flan  cheesecake  and fruit compote in the slow cooker.  Fast forward several years later and I was looking to expand my slow cooker desserts repertoire  so imagine my delight when I got an e-mail from Lisa Ekus that highlighted “Slow Cooker Desserts” by Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore! Roxanne and Kathy are cookbook authors  food consultants  cooking teachers and food bloggers who have written seven cookbooks and a popular blog  www.pluggedintocooking.com.  As soon as my copy of “Slow Cooker Desserts” arrived  I couldn’t wait to dig in to the many inviting recipes covering not only cakes and cheesecakes  but also bread puddings  fruits  and candy and fondues. The book opens with a good compact guide to slow cookers  bakeware  and ingredients. The layout is uncluttered and straightforward  and each recipe is followed by helpful tips  making it perfect for novice bakers. The gorgeous photography by Jennifer Davick deserves a special mention as well.  The first recipe I tried was the Praline-Pumpkin Cheesecake. I decided to substitute a gingersnap crust for the graham crackers  and it added the perfect touch of spice to complement the spices in the cheesecake filling. Note that you do need to blind bake the gingersnap crust prior to baking in the slow cooker  but this only adds a few minutes to the prep time. Also  perhaps it was the brand of gingersnaps I used  but I would recommend adding a little extra melted butter until the crust comes together – the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter for ½ cup crumbs. One thing I would suggest is to also liberally spray the sides of your springform pan as well – mine is supposedly nonstick  but I followed the recipe (which only specifies to spray the bottom of the pan) and a large portion of my cheesecake edges stuck and broke. I normally do spray the entire pan with Baker’s Joy  but I follow the recipes as written when I am testing for reviews.  The finished cheesecake texture is very fluffy and a bit crumbly  so I did have difficulty cutting it neatly I’m not sure if I may have beat TOO much air into my filling and will beat for less next time. The praline topping (made in the microwave in under three minutes) is destined to become my new secret weapon in the kitchen! This homemade caramel was delicious and deceptively easy and would also make a great addition to ice cream or cakes. All combined (gingersnap crust  spiced pumpkin filling  praline topping)  this is a great fall dessert with minimal effort and also frees up your oven for other baking tasks.  The second recipe I tried was the candied cranberry and crystallized ginger chutney this one called my name because I am a certified fiend when it comes to candied ginger. I had a bag of organic cranberries in the freezer that I was looking to use up  so it worked out perfectly that I already had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry (even the ginger liqueur!). My bag of organic cranberries was slightly smaller than the 16-oz. bag called for in the recipe  so I scaled back on the sugar quite a bit as I was using candied ginger (I used ¾ cup sugar in place of the 1 ¼ in the recipe  and it was plenty sweet for me). It also had the bonus of making my kitchen smell amazing as it cooked! I cooked mine down for a little longer the recipe says that it should be thin  but I like my chutney on the very thick side more like a compote. The recipe calls for between 5 to 7 hours on low and I ended up cooking mine for 3 hours on high due to time. This would be fantastic stirred into yogurt  as an accompaniment to Indian food  or even as a side dish in place of jellied cranberries or cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.  The third recipe was the chocolate cashew clusters. I’d seen slow cooker candy (including nut clusters) pop up in my Facebook feed  but I’d never tried making it before. The recipe uses salted cashews  semisweet and milk chocolate chips  a dark chocolate candy bar  and candy coating to create decadent nut clusters that look like they came from a candy shop. These take about 1 ½ hours on low plus cooling / set time (3 to 5 hours).  Other recipes on my to-make list from “Slow Cooker Desserts” include the cinnamon-calvados applesauce  rice pudding with cherries  and many of the cheesecakes (brownie chunk  German chocolate  ginger-peach  coconut cream) and cakes (cider-glazed apple-walnut cake  Southern sweet potato cake  pineapple butter cake). There is enough variety and possible variations (I need to find a way to make a cookie butter cheesecake!) to keep you happily baking for months to come.  (Thank you to Lisa Ekus for the review copy!),1
looks very realistic and unique,I love this my new sword letter opener! &lt3. Arrived ultra fast and looks exactly like the picture I have not yet opened it/taken it out because it's for a gift but it looks like it works fine &#603 I loved it the moment I saw it looks very realistic and unique &#603,1
work well for an upcoming concert,Cute!. This is a cute clear purse. It's definitely a better alternative to the sporty looking clear bags out there. I did have some difficulties attaching the strap to the bag. The clasp was hard to get into the grommet and I ended up getting my finger caught at one point. Other than that  it's a nice bag and will work well for an upcoming concert I am attending.,1
portable flosser,Great portable flosser. This portable flosser works considerably well. I took it with me on a trip to visit my grandkids recently. It packs easily and does the job of getting loose food particles between my teeth. To be honest  I also have a Sonicare flosser that has a much stronger water flow which I do prefer  but this is a lesser expensive way to get the job done and it is a handy size for traveling. So  I will be using this one when I am on the go as a way to maintain my oral health.,1
could not get it together,HORRIBLE PRODUCT. This arch is a very bad product. Horrible product! It started out ok  but the holes do not match  once you start to connect the seating part.  I could not get it together. So  now I am stuck with a piece of junk that cannot be put together! I called amazon and told them the problem. I was told to take the unit down and repackage it for return the next day. I am 72 years old with heart problems and I had a hard enough time putting the top part together! Told them to pick it up like it was because I could not take the parts down  they refused! Now  I am stuck with junk  and I paid a lot of money for this junk  on a retirement salary. Please read some of the reviews  I wish I had before making the purchase. The holes do not match and I do not know how to make new holes and I should not have to do that! Beware before you buy this product.!,0
you won’t be disappointed with this cart,This cart will absolutely exceed your expectations!. This cart exceeded my expectations by 200% even at the $169 price tag.  It is designed to work hard and not break.  It’s built like a tank  I have no doubt about the 400 lb load rating. The larger wheels easily go up/down stairs and curbs.  I expect this cart to last a very long time.  One cool feature is that when the cart is closed and the wheels are folded up  if you hold it vertically  the wheels are slightly below the platform and roll.  This comes in handy if you don’t have any cargo and you’re have limited access  you can close the cart and roll it instead of carrying it.  You won’t be disappointed with this cart!,1
Sturdy,Sturdy. I always loved the game of monopoly I knew I would like this Puzzle. For me it was a bit of a challenge... But I did finish it. It was fun . The pc are easy to hold and the puzzle stays together well.,1
favorite paintings,Missing one piece!. I bought this because my daughter loves to put puzzles together and this is one of her favorite paintings.  She spent weeks working on getting it together  only to find it's missing one single piece to complete it!,1
storyline flowed smoothly,"""Haunted Carousel"" an entertaning ride.. In ""The Haunted Carousel "" teenage sleuth Nancy Drew is on her eighth case: investigating amusement park ""hauntings"" in Captains Cove  NJ. One of the park's famed carousel horses has been stolen  and the carousel has been mysteriously starting and stopping on its own. Also  the park's roller coaster stopped suddenly  causing a rider to injure his neck. With the park shut down  Nancy must interview the employees and explore the park to find clues. ""Haunted Carousel"" has some nice improvements over past games: the addition of the ""to do"" list  journal  and cell phone (no more endless running back and forth to Nancy's hotel to call). If Nancy gets stuck  she can call her friends Bess and George and the Hardy Boys. The game has two levels  Junior and Senior Detective  and there are plenty of built-in tips and hints  including a park operating manual with an overview of most puzzle components. ""Haunted Carousel"" seemed to be one of the easier ND games. ""Haunted Carousel"" really draws the player into the park's atmosphere  complete with hotel room service  arcade games  a ride on the carousel (and chance to grab the brass ring)  and more. The storyline flowed smoothly  the puzzles were organic (programming an arcade game  switching roller coaster tracks  repairing the carousel's band organ  reading invisible ink)  the voice work was above average and the characters had distinct personalities. Music was pronounced  including carnival music for the carousel and ominous creepy tunes for the haunted house. Nancy must watch her step as always  since someone wants to stop her from finding out the truth behind the hauntings. Along the way she helps someone come to terms with the past  sniffs out an insurance fraud  and digs up long-lost truths and secrets about the park and its employees. This is a lovely adventure with a unique atmosphere that will delight young sleuths.",1
chance of me botching this was about 100%,worked great. I am not a plumber  so the chance of me botching this was about 100%. I didn't I would like to thank the academy  and mostly EasyDrain  for helping me renovate my girlfriends 1930's plumbing in her bathroom like a champ.,0
cute,Cute and Comfortable!. First  the picture of this doesn't look like the actual bra. If you look at the other pictures in the description  it shows the real one. It's all one color of brown. The picture shown makes it look like it has two distinctly different colors. I would say it's true to size. While it is a full coverage bra  it's very thin so I can't wear it under just anything. The lace will show through lighter  form fitting fabrics. When wearing form fitting shirts  I really have to wear t-shirt bras or molded cups  for nipple coverage as well. It's a comfortable enough bra to wear all day long. It's cute  too!,1
hyperactive pup,Perfect for hyperactive pup. It’s great to have a toy my pup can play with herself.  Gives me a break.,1
fits some interesting mics,Excellent deal and fits some interesting mics. First: you do not need to soak them or do anything else other than spread them with your fingers and let them set overnight. They are like memory foam in that respect. I mention this because there are reviews here that recommend that you soak them. Not necessary.  Mine fit more than your typical SM58 form factor. I have one on a Shure 87A  one on a Sennheiser e945 and another on a very odd shaped mic  the Blue enCore 300.  The do what they are supposed to. I use them on mics in my studio to keep things sanitary.  Bottom line: do not freak out it you receive what appears to be black  foam pancakes. They will come to life very easily.,1
wash well in the washer,"Medium compression socks in a fun “normal sock” style blue hearts are attractive socks run large. This is my fifth pair of Lollop compression socks. However  two of the pairs are a small/medium size and three are medium large. This is a medium/large and runs a bit big.  I take a size 9 to 9.5 in a woman's shoe and 7.5 to 8 in a man's boot. I ordered these in a medium / large size which is supposed to be for that size foot. However  they are way too big in the foot area as the heel comes halfway up my ankle. They do fit around the calves nicely  however.  I love that they offer medium compression (15-20 mmHg) around my calves and some compression on the soles of the feet and arches. I felt comfortable in them all day without feeling like the life was being squeezed out of my legs. I also like the ""normal sock"" look of these knee-highs and they wash well in the washer but I lay them flat to dry. The blue hearts are very attractive even though the off-white is a bit dingy looking. I consider these socks very stylish. The material is 45% cotton  40% nylon  and 15% spandex.  If the sizing was specified correctly  this would have gotten 5 stars. ",1
doesn't slip,Fits well  no leaks. Love it!  This mask doesn't leak.  No water in my eyes  it fit comfortably.  It doesn't slip.  I recommend this mask.  We use it in the swimming pool,1
middle started to sag,Not for plus sized gals. I weighed about 250 when I got this saddle  now about 233.  The saddle was great.  I love flat saddles and this is one but then after a month of use  the middle started to sag  so it then felt like a saddle with a swoop.  This then gave me pressure sores.  I have actual notice this issue with the middle sinking down with most Terry saddles.  I think they are made for ladies who weigh less.  Even when not on the saddle now  you can just put your hands on the middle and it just sinks down  like it is just cloth on plastic.  So this saddle is great if you weigh less than I did.,0
Soap smells really good,"Aromatic bars of ""Soap Shields"" that gently scrub & cleanse. These small bars of soap smell really good and perform well in terms of cleansing and not leaving skin feeling stripped. I like that they are made in USA  handmade in Ohio. These are not fancy soaps. They are small  but they are not necessarily travel sized. They just have a good size and shape that fits perfectly into the hand. That stood out to me on first use. I really like how well it fits in my hand. The bars are tear dropped or pear shaped. More specifically  it is shaped to be a like a defense shield. Get it?  As this is meant to be a bit of an immune defense/support item.  The bars are thin  but not fragile. I can palm it and easily rub it all over without it falling out of my hand. I have been using one bar on and off for a couple of weeks now  and it isn't just disappearing. There are six loose bars in a resealable bag.  The soap has a slight intentional grit to it . This adds some scrubbing action. Creates a nice lather and rinses well. The scent is an intriguing mix of essential oils. Clove  Cinnamon  Oregano  Peppermint  Parsley  Eucalyptus and Rosemary essential oils Not overpowering. Really quite nice.  It has been an odd  but unexpectedly pleasant product to use. The price is budget friendly. I find nothing bad about them or my experience so far. I may consider them again when I run out. I really think they are worth the try.  ""CLEAN INGREDIENTS - Our formula just 8 simple ingredients. Free from harsh chemicals that damage your skin like Sulfates  phthalates  parabens  or synthetic fragrances. It’s Vegan and never tested on animals.""",1
good flavor,Good beef jerky  excellent lightly spiced  perfect for snacking. Great not-overly-spicy beef jerky. Perfect size for packing in my lunch bag for a mid afternoon snack. This is definitely one of my favorites. I did deduct a star because even though the flavor was great  I did find this pack a little on the dry side. I am going to order another package before month end and if I find the next package to be better  I will be adding to this review and changing it to a 5 star. My brother and nephew really love this jerky  too  and have been eating it for years  so I know it's got to be good!,1
fits well true to size,Women Golf Shirt. Quality and color first class. no ironing  works well for me in Florida heat when I golf. Fits well true to size  Love it,1
good for you,Great protein drink  satisfies and is good for you. This is my new favorite mid-afternoon protein drink. I take it with me to work and have a tasty  satisfying treat that is good for me and satisfies my hunger and sweet cravings. When I am not working  I take a bottle of this and pour it in my Ninja along with some fresh blueberries and strawberries and some ice to make the most amazing smoothie. I love that something that tastes so good and gives me the nutrients that my body needs. Highly recommend this for everyone.,1
works great,Best pet carrier in the market today!. I have always used hard-sided carriers for my cat which tend to be bulky and difficult to store. I really was interested in trying a soft-sided one and I am glad I did! This is light weight and foldable so if you need to store it you can easily. Quality made  it assembles easily and has zippers that move smoothly and do not snag. My cat is eleven pounds and I got the larger size to give her a little more room and it works great for her. I highly recommend this soft sided pet carrier.,1
shoulder straps,A lovely leather tote!. This tote by Pascado is nice. It is rugged and well made. There are shoulder straps (two sizes). The leather is an orangey-brown  which will match most outfits. The inside of the bag is lined. There are two front pockets (magnetic closures) and a rear zippered one. There are also two side pockets which are useful if you want to slip an umbrella inside. The size of the tote is decent and can hold a variety of items (essentials and a small electronic). *The electronics I would consider are a small iPad mini or Kindle. Either would fit fine. The front or side pockets can hold a small cell phone or keys. I have a OnePlus cell phone that fits fine. And finally  I love that this company always encloses a nice “thank you letter ” which is a great touch! I’d recommend this tote.,1
work with so many different kind of bottles,Awesome Product. What a great idea and they really work with so many different kind of bottles.,1
rated for 0 to 12 months,"Excellent infant teether with gum massaging nubs drop resistant. There is one BPA-free silicone teether in this package. The silicone is super soft. I consider this cute and engaging. This is easy for the baby to grab and hold onto. It has no sharp edges or parts that can fall off. This is perfect as a teether and is one solid piece. I also love that the ears have nubs which act as a gum massaging / tooth cleaning ""tool."" As is typical  always supervise when the baby is using this. This is rated for 0 to 12 months.  This is made in China. The current price of $6.29 ($6.99 minus 10%) is competitively priced for this. Overall  I consider this a great teether that is drop resistant and small enough for newborns. I had given one like this to my neighbor's infant and he absolutely loved it.",1
have to subscribe to something,Fun. My family has enjoyed Just Dance games over the years. This one is a little different because it requires the use of a cell phone. While I'm not crazy about that  it does seem to work well. The song list is pretty good  though as with most of the Just Dance games  I only knew about half of the songs. To access all of the songs  you do have to subscribe to something. Long gone are the days when the purchase of the game included access to all of the songs.,0
size and quantity,Great size and quantity!. With 3 girls  we go through a LOT of hair ties! These are wonderful and there are a ton of them!! They fit around my pointer finger… about 1”.,1
user interface has remained relatively unchanged,"Superb Chess Database and Preparation Software. I am a longtime user of Chess Assistant  having used it since version 6.0. Chess Assistant is at its heart a database program but it is a lot more than just a database manager with a lot of chess games stored in databases - it also is a tournament preparation partner  a playing partner and top-drawer analysis tool. Compared to other commercial chess database applications available  it is a phenomenal value.  There are three editions of Chess Assistant available. The base level package is the Starter package and it is a great place to start when working with this type of application. The Professional package is similar but has additional content and has a more powerful commercial chess-playing ""engine"" included. The Mega package is the top-of-the-line offering and has even more content included. I will focus on the Professional package.  Chess Assistant includes several databases of games. The most notable is the HugeBase which includes over 5 million games. There is a Guru database which includes games from the top chess players in the world. There is also a Correspondence database that includes games between notable correspondence players. All of these databases are searchable via a number of criteria  such as player name  opening system used  date  result and more. Using the search functions  it is very easy to isolate any desired categories of games  such as all games played by a specific player in a range of dates where said player used a specific opening system.  Not all of the databases are collections of games. One database in particular is the Openings database and it is used to study opening systems. This is a powerful and complete database for really getting into the meat of any opening. It ties in with the other databases as well so following a specific line in an opening can show the percentage of wins to losses using any given line.  Where this database system really shows its power is in the functions geared towards preparation for opponents. With a single menu item selection all of the games by a specific player can be pulled from a database with a breakdown of openings used and the success rate of those openings against the player being researched. Professional players will find this to be invaluable - in short order this functionality can quickly expose an opponent's soft spots.  Chess Assistant does a lot more than manage databases of chess games. It includes several chess playing engines that can be used for sparring. And  because of built-in support for WinBoard and UCI protocols  adding other engines is easy to so that almost all of the available chess engines for download on the Internet can be linked in and used for playing  either against a human opponent or against each other.  Engines that are linked in can be used for analyzing games as well.  Once a game is in one of the databases  there are functions for performing game analysis that provide a quick and complete automatic analysis of said game with minimal interaction from the user. Analysis can be based on the amount of time the engine is allowed to use or the depth to which the engine should search (depth being in ""ply""  or half-moves). Analyzed games are automatically annotated by the engine and additional annotations can be made by the user.  The Professional package includes Houdini 3 Pro  currently the strongest chess playing engine available in the world. (The Starter package includes Houdini 3  not Houdini 3 Pro). Houdini is powerful enough that it will cruch all opponents (including the world champion) with ease so it is not the best choice for a sparring partner unless you want to expose weaknesses in your game with clinical precision. Where Houdini shows its value is actually in game analysis  where it can find even the most subtle advantages and explain where errors occurred that other engines cannot see.  Another nice feature included in Chess Assistant is an interface to the Internet Chess Club (ICC)  where one can watch games  play and interact with other players. There is limited guest access  so be aware than not all functions are available to non-subscribers.  Chess Assistant's user interface has remained relatively unchanged over the several years I have been using it and its the one criticism I have of the application. Though many functions are grouped appropriately  there are a few cases where finding a specific setting requires a but of hunting through menu selections and dialog boxes. Also  I dislike some of the default settings as well  one example being that engines are given only a small amount of memory for hash tables which limits their strength. These are nitpicks and can be worked around but are worth mention.  Chess Assistant is a powerful and fairly complete chess application  combining database functionality with the ability to link in chess playing/analysis engines. It is the one chess application I use consistently and in my opinion is worth every penny. If you need a chess database application  Chess Assistant is probably the best value available.",1
organization container is a huge plus,Highly recommend. This is a great assortment and the organization container is a huge plus! Will buy again!,1
skin feels and looks like it is glowing,Wonderful product! Highly recommend!. I need to begin by saying I absolutely love Ahava products. I found Ahava on a pilgrimage I did to Israel in 2008 and a visit to the site of Masada at the Dead Sea. I picked up a gift package of a few of their products and I was immediately hooked. Every day I use their Mud exfoliator  at night I use their night cream and at least once a week I use one of their Mud Pack facial products. I am 61 years old and am often told I look to be in my low 50s. I was thrilled when I saw this new Ahava Osmoter product. I have been using this daily now for about a week and I will say my skin feels and looks like it is glowing. It goes on like silk  has a nice subtle fragrnace and my skin feels amazing throughout the day (even after I put on makeup and/or sun screen). I know this is pricy and you might be able to do better purchasing elsewhere (if you find it cheaper). You won't find a product line that is better for you than Ahava  feeding your skin richly with Dead Sea minerals and keeping you looking young and vibrant.,1
Visa pour les beaux jours,A good introduction to Céline's earlier works. Long before Beauty and the Beast and her first English-language albums  Céline was already a star in her native Québec. She has been recording albums since 1981  and until a few years ago her earliest albums were only  available on records. But 19 songs from 1981-1988 are now available on this  collection  including the rarest  Ce n'était qu'un rêve. Céline's mother  wrote the song for her twelve-year old daughter and it was this song that  joined Céline's destiny with that of her husband and manager René  Angélil.   Many of Céline's early hits are featured here  including  D'amour ou d'amitié and Ne partez pas sans moi. Also included are a number  of B-sides (the rare L'amour viendra  Visa pour les beaux jours  etc.) and  the complete lyrics to each song. Sorry  no translations are given in the  CD booklet.  This is an excellent CD for fans of Céline to become  aquainted with her earlier works en français. It is well worth the price.  Do yourself a favour and buy this CD today!,1
ordered another set,Love them. Love these lights  ordered another set,1
Macadamia and Rice Milk Body Polish,This is a great gift set!!!!. This gift set is a steal at under $25. It contains deep moisture body wash  deodorant dry spray  Intensive Repair Shampoo  Intensive Repair Conditioner  Macadamia and Rice Milk Body Polish and a loofah. If you were to purchase all of these separately you would run over $40. I love the way my skin feels after using these in the shower and part of my morning routine for the past month now. I particularly love the body polish. I highly recommend and can say with the boxing  this would make a fantastic present for the holidays. Highly recommend!,1
Worked well,Hair cover. Worked well,1
Great as always,Peace and Quiet!. Great as always.,1
need extras of,As advertised.. Husband bought for greenhouse and reports they work great and as expected.  They are one of those things you need extras of apparently and the local stores only carry them seasonally.  So Amazon to the rescue!,1
a little pricey,Help your eyelashes come back faster will let you know how it works after 8 weeks. I was going to return one but it takes 6 to 8 weeks to notice a difference and I do want to have Fuller eyelashes and eyebrows so I'm going to give it a chance even though it was a little pricey my eyelashes deserve it,0
disappointing,Don't bother. Bypass this option for an American company version. It was very disappointing  inaccurately described  and no full refund on returns.,0
extremely pricey,Nice supplement but on the pricey side. On the plus side  I rarely eat breakfast in the morning and I easily can take one of these with no adverse stomach or heartburn side effects. In reading the ingredients  these appear to be chock full of almost everything my 60 year old body needs to be healthy and feel energetic. I have been taking them now for two weeks and I honestly do not feel different  but I am sure it is too soon to tell. On the negative side (hence the deduction of one star)  this is almost $50 for a little over 3 week supply. I find this extremely pricey and not something that I will continue taking once I have completed the bottle (unless I have a miraculous awakening that I do not feel currently). Thinking that Centrum Silver or One a Day for Women can fill most of this for a far more reasonable price.,0
super light,Love. This kimono thing looks really awesome. I really enjoyed the look of it. Super light  so it is great for warmer weather. It does come a little past my calves  but not quite to my ankles.,1
It holds all my granddaughter bath toys,Five Stars. This is just what I was looking for! It holds all my granddaughter bath toys.,1
love these for storing small items around the house,Perfect for many uses!!!. Great bags and great for multiple purposes. Not only are they great for refrigerated foods (cheese  fruits  vegetables) but I find them great for freezing food as well (works best if you squeeze all the air out before sealing the bag). Needless to say  they also work well for lunch bag use (although they may be a little large unless you are storing more than one sandwich). However  most of all I also love these for storing small items around the house. I have bags of nails and picture hangers in these out in the garage  spools of threads and pins in my laundry room  I use them in the bathroom for small cosmetic items and hair pins and the smaller children use them for crayons and picture puzzle pieces. I honestly can't say enough about the versatility and the great variety of things you can do with these Ziploc slider bags. Every house should have at least one box of them available at all times. Can be used for so many purposes.,1
stay put,Superb socks with extra cushioning stays in place while walking are also warm. I first bought a pair of these socks at REI for $27 and loved them. I wanted another color of the same sock so I purchased these. These socks are wonderful. They are slightly thick  sturdy  snug but not too tight  and feel fabulous on. They cushion my heel and bottom of foot and they do not move around like other socks  which helps prevent blisters. I walk a lot and these socks stay put even on a two-hour walk. I LOVE THEM.  One caveat  however. These socks must be an older model of the same sock that I purchased at REI. The reason I say that is because compared to the original sock I purchased  they are about two inches shorter. I then did some research and found a comparison chart for two of the same mountaineering socks by the same name. The only difference between the two models is that there's a slightly different fabric combination and it is not listed as quick drying.  To me both socks feel the same. I also ordered three more pairs. I now own five pairs of these socks and they are WONDERFUL! In fact  I love them so much that I ordered this [[ASIN:B01F47N7XK men's pair]] for my boyfriend. My boyfriend loves them as well. He wears them to bed.,0

natural flavorings,fresh and soft. These are subtle licorice pieces. There are pieces that are predominately coconut. I like them.  My bag arrived with a distant &#34use by date&#34 and was soft and fresh. For me  I am so happy to read the ingredient list.  No red dye #40 or yellow #5 or 6.  Here is the ingredient list on the bag: Sugar  cane molasses  wheat flour  glucose syrup (contains sulphites)  desiccated coconut  palm oil  beef gelatin  corn starch  glycerol  natural colors (plain caramel  beetroot red  curcumin  paprika). fat reduced cocoa  licorice exctract  natural flavorings (aniseed  lemon  raspberry  vanilla  orange) glazing agent (beeswax) fruit and vegetable juices for coloring. Allergy alert: equipment shared with products that include peanuts  tree nuts  milk  egg  soy and wheat. NOT a health food.  But a delightful treat without harmful dyes still legal in the USA.,1
leaves skin feeling moisturized,Nice Exfoliation. My daughter is a huge fan of I Dew Care products. I ordered this for her  but I gave it a try first as I am a huge fan of body scrubs! This scrub has a waxy-like consistency. I found it best to rub it between my hands for a moment before applying it to my body. In doing so  it lathers a little bit and changes the consistency to something that won't glob onto your body. There is a good amount of grit to it  but it's not rough or scratchy. It actually does a nice job of exfoliating. I was hoping for a delicious coconut smell  but it's not. I can't pinpoint the actual scent  but it's very nice and pleasant. The scrub rinses well. Because of the waxy base of the scrub  it doesn't leave your skin feeling dry or stripped. There's no waxy build up either. I think my daughter will enjoy it. I was especially pleased with how it worked on my hands and elbows.,1
dinosaur designed on the outside,Great multivitamin  everything my grandson needs in a terrifc tasting gummy!. My 6 year old grandson loves taking his vitamins this way! Not only are they dinosaur designed on the outside  but the gummies are as well. I love that they contain most of the vitamins and supplements that he needs for his growing body in an easy to take gummy. Of course  with any gummies like this you need to keep them out of the little one's reach as I know mine would eat more of them if I didn't control them. Outside of that  it's a great way to keep his health optimal and I don't need to wrestle with him to take it  lol. Great idea  great multivitamin!,1
comfortable to fall asleep,Bringing sweet dreams. The sleep headphones are an awesome product!! I have a pair of my own and this pair was for my pregnant daughter who's been having problems sleeping  with the sleep headphones she's been able to block out excessive noise and relax to her choice of music while falling asleep comfortably. We both recommend this product 5 stars,1
expensive,"Decent  But Expensive Not Fully Functional on New Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" Tablet. CROSSWORDS by Standalone is a decent crossword puzzle app  but inflexible and expensive.  On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet  the working display shows about two-thirds of a weekday NY Times puzzle grid  and I can't find any way to resize the grid to show the whole puzzle at once. (You must swipe down or hit an arrow button to reveal the lower one-third of the grid.)  The Across and Down clues appear alongside the grid in a readable typeface  but the clues are cut off at the right.  (Perhaps this is an 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD issue that the developer will correct fortunately  clicking on a cut-off clue will display the full clue below the grid.)  The puzzle hints--found under the list icon beside the app icon  at the left--don't always work as expected.  For example  ""reveal entire puzzle"" only filled in one word (for the 1-down clue) when I started from the ""hints for 1-down"" screen.  In contrast  ""reveal entire puzzle"" filled in the entire puzzle when I started from a ""press-and-hold-on-clue"" popup.  Worse  the general settings for navigation (e.g.  ""skip filled squares""  ""show mistakes"") don't seem to function at all.  (Perhaps this is another Kindle Fire HD issue for the developer to fix.)  The app allows you to enter multiple letters in a single square  and to look up puzzle info (must-haves for NY Times crossword solvers).  If you are a NY Times crosswords subscriber  the app will automatically download the daily puzzles for you.  The app comes with an assortment of puzzles already installed  and allows you to browse for and download many more puzzles from the Internet.  It also allows you to establish an account and compare your times with other solvers.  However  the FREE [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] app does nearly all of the same things.  (Crosswords Plus does not download your NY Times subscription puzzles automatically  although it makes it easy to download them daily it doesn't come with puzzles loaded  although it points you to free Internet sources and it doesn't have a feature for comparing scores with other solvers.)  In addition  [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] allows you to resize the grid  offers an alternate clues-only view  includes the usual hints options  and has navigational settings (skipping boxes  etc.) that are fully functional on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet.  Even if this CROSSWORDS app worked perfectly  I would still prefer [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]].  For this reason  and because of the high price and current Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet issues  I rate CROSSWORDS at 3 stars.",0
Puts off a pretty shine of light,Good price. Great. Looks beautiful on house. Didn’t come with bulbs. Puts off a pretty shine of light.,1
comfy,Big  loose and comfy. Not sure what I thought I was getting  but I wouldn't use these for outdoor (or even in the gym) use. They are super comfortable  baggy/loose and are great for sleeping or just lounging around the house. I don't like the waist band  found it keeps rolling down when I wear them (have to keep pulling them up). I think they are soft and comfy  but not for me for yoga or any other type of sport (unless I am going to use them in my home).,1
used for multiple uses,Great value and used for multiple uses.. Yep  we use it for oiling the paper shredder  and for brake pads on our spin bike!  Great value for the product  don't need a lot to do the job!,1

only keep you warm if you sat in a sauna,Yikes. What you see is definitely not what you get.. Terrible  Low Quality material. Would have returned it but I already washed it. Material is much thinner than it appears in photo and would probably only keep you warm if you sat in a sauna. The photo material looks like a thick polyester material you would HOPE is inner lined with fleece. Keep dreaming.  The outer material is actually a cheap cotton tee shirt-like material with an abrasive texture on inside that mimics sweats but not quite.  After two washings  the hood ties are already fraying apart at the knotted ends and have almost completely faded  even while using Cheer color guard. They definitely overpriced this product for the quality you receive. Don't bother.,0
glucose syrup,fresh and soft. These are subtle licorice pieces. There are pieces that are predominately coconut. I like them.  My bag arrived with a distant &#34use by date&#34 and was soft and fresh. For me  I am so happy to read the ingredient list.  No red dye #40 or yellow #5 or 6.  Here is the ingredient list on the bag: Sugar  cane molasses  wheat flour  glucose syrup (contains sulphites)  desiccated coconut  palm oil  beef gelatin  corn starch  glycerol  natural colors (plain caramel  beetroot red  curcumin  paprika). fat reduced cocoa  licorice exctract  natural flavorings (aniseed  lemon  raspberry  vanilla  orange) glazing agent (beeswax) fruit and vegetable juices for coloring. Allergy alert: equipment shared with products that include peanuts  tree nuts  milk  egg  soy and wheat. NOT a health food.  But a delightful treat without harmful dyes still legal in the USA.,1
interesting plot,Better Than Average. There are so many mediocre movies out there that just aren't that good.  I thought this was a cut above that.  Sure it's a bit predictable and it's not exactly non-stop action that takes your breath away  but it has an interesting plot and it moves along well.  The actors all do a good job and are convincing in their roles.  Eva Longoria seems a bit out of her league and her character doesn't develop into that much  but she sure is easy on the eyes.  She's okay  but they could have done a bit more with her character.  It's not a 5-star movie  but there was never a boring moment for me.  Do you want to own it? perhaps not.  Probably better as a one time rental  although it's entertaining enough to watch over again  once in a while.,1
gorgeous photos of street scenes,A gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!. When I think of Malaysian dishes  it’s the spicy  layered flavors of Norman Musa’s “Amazing Malaysian” that I think of. It opens with street food and snacks  and moves on to seafood  meat  vegetables  rice and noodles  pudding and drinks  and the Malaysian pantry. Gorgeous photos of street scenes in Malaysia pepper the pages  while the gold-embossed cover looks great sitting out on a table or countertop.  You'll find street snack favorites like chicken satay  net pancakes  roti canai  and fried spring rolls  along with Indian lentil patties  grilled fish paste in banana leaf  tofu stuffed with crunchy vegetables  and the gorgeous Kak Besah’s curry puffs. The seafood dishes reminded me of many preparations I had last year while working in Taiwan whole fish steamed with lemongrass  ginger and chilies  squid stir fry  and scrambled eggs with oysters. The meat dishes featured are mostly chicken and beef (no pork unlike Ping’s book)  with lamb curry  beef rendang  and numerous chicken dishes.  One of my new favorite recipes is the Nyonya Vermicelli Noodle Salad  which features rice noodles  tofu beansprouts  and ginger with plenty of lime juice and fresh herbs (if you are vegetarian  leave out the shrimp paste and prawns). I also loved the Malay Vegetable Dhal Curry  pumpkin in turmeric and coconut milk  and eggs in chili sambal (think shakshuka).  Rice and noodle dishes include tomato rice (nasi tomato)  wok-fried flat noodles  curry laksa  chicken rice  herbal rice  and several egg-fried rices in addition to fried noodles. Desserts range from the effortless (fresh mango  honey and coconut  tropical fruit salad) to the more elaborate (pandan custard and sticky rice layered sweet  sticky rice balls  soy panna cotta with passion fruit and crushed chocolate cookies. And you’ll find any number of refreshing drinks  from lemongrass and honey tea and rose syrup drink to pulled sweet tea and iced fresh lime juice.  At the end are several staple condiments  from the ubiquitous chili paste and ginger soy sauce  to sambals (chili  coconut)  sauces  and vegetable pickles.  Norman Musa’s recipes tend to be a bit more advanced but also result in more complex  nuanced flavors. This is a gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!,1
lots of fruit,Great for your plants.. I love this product and it is $2.00 cheaper than Lowes and $1.00 cheaper than Walmart. I will order 3 next time  since I am a flower person. All my plants do great from feeding them every week to 10 days. In Florida I use it on my flowering trees even my Avocado tree  who has lots of fruit. The tree is so beautiful with large leaves  even I do not like avocadoes.,1
pad underneath is really Cushiony,Very easy to fold up. About the pad that goes underneath it makes it really Cushiony,1
feel clean and fresh after every use,A great new addition to my skin care regime!. This is my new favorite body wash! I have been using Dove for years now  but this exfoliating body wash really has made a difference in my skin! After using it for almost a month now  my skin is radiant  softer and smoother than it has been in years. I typically use exfoliators for my face  but when it came to my body I never tried using them. I love the way my skin feels and looks  and the fragrance is light and lasts nicely. As far as the bodywash component  I feel clean and fresh after every use. No complaints  only praise for a great exfoliating body wash!,1
may need to size up,"Very Flowy. This top is very pretty and can easily be dressed up or down. The fabric is lightweight and has no stretch. If you're a larger cup size  you may need to size up. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. The X-Large would have been ideal.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",0
soft and comfortable,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
sturdy,A flawless mold. I love this thing. It's really well made and sturdy. Honestly  this is the best mold I've ever purchased. 10/10 worth it.,1
relatable,Fun. This song is just fun.  From the words to the music.  It is very lyrical as far as the singing goes.  It is just fun and relatable.,1
wash beautifully,Floral tank dress with pockets. Oh man.. these dresses are the cat's meow.  I bought 2 and came back to order 2 more.  I am 5'7&#34... 38DDD  usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  The XX fits me perfectly. I am a little busty so it's sort of empirish.. but doesn't look maternity.  And the best part?? POCKETS ladies!! Oh yes.  Lovely pockets that don't stick out. Just handy.  I wear them over my swimsuits... I dress them up with jewelry... and/or a jacket.  The prints are vibrant and clear.  The wash beautifully (I wash on delicate and tumble dry on &#34low&#34).  If you try one  you'll come back for more I bet.  This dress would fit a wide range of body types in my opinion. Further  as I travel a fair amount  they pack so nicely  without wrinkles!  Love love love. And I rarely get to say that about clothes of any kind. UPDATE:  10/3 ...  I've gone back to order 2 other prints.  They wash beautifully.  Wear so comfortably.  The pockets are the key. Would love if they would come up with a sleeved version!,1
Mrs. Henry collapses,Very Enjoyable Period Mystery about Female Botany Graduate Studen. In this delightful debut  A Botanist's Guide to Parties and Poisons introduces us to Saffron Everleigh  the only female working in the University College London Biology Department.  She is the assistant to Professor Maxwell  a botanist. He is an old family friend  who assigns Saffron substantive work and mentors her  an unusual experience for many assistants and exceptional for a woman in this position. Five years ago  Saffron's father  also a botanist  died in WWI. The novel opens in the roaring Twenties. The University has recently secured funding for an interdisciplinary South American expedition.  While Professor Maxwell was not included on the team  Saffron is assisting him in preparing the documentation necessary for a research project to be conducted on his behalf. The book opens with a party to celebrate the upcoming six-month expedition. Dr. Henry  a history professor who will lead the expedition and well-known philanderer is there with his long-suffering wife. Saffron chats up various people  with mixed success. She decides to take her leave  feeling rather invisible as the only female scientist at the party and serving on the lowest rung of professional staff. She happens upon Mr. Ashton  a young biologist as she is heading down a hallway to make her farewells. As they chat  the two inadvertently overhear Mrs. Henry having a highly personal conversation with their hostess. When she makes her way to the room where the party has gathered  Saffron finds celebratory speeches underway. She approaches her hosts to thank them just when another round of champagne is being poured.  Very near Saffron  Mrs. Henry takes one sip of champagne and collapses  to be carried away by ambulance in grave condition. Khavari does a lovely job establishing Saffron as a curious and competent investigator  working to point out poison related information to the police investigating Mrs. Henry's apparent poisoning checking out a decent array of suspects pulling in others to help with her dangerous enquiries giving us a nice feel for several years post-war London life and academia throwing in a possible romance and keeping it light enough to be a cozy and accurate enough to be a pleasing historical fiction piece. The clues are there  not too clear cut  the red herrings are decent and the setting is well wrought. This one is a win for me!  I will definitely look for the next Sapphron Everleigh installment  with pleasure.,1
Amazon gift card,Who doesn’t love a gift card?. An Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for anyone young to old  I dig how Amazon packages the card and mails it snail mail so that I do not have to! Electronic e-gift cards rule too  but more often than not  I prefer to have a physical card mailed to the recipient.,1
just ordered the mustard seed pendant,my favorite gift i bought for me. Craftsmanship superb and love the fact its handmade.  I have lots of jewelry.  It sets in special boxes and beautiful containers.  This i want to wear all the time.  I just ordered the mustard seed pendant.  I also make my own jewlery.  Wish i had made it!,1
Great fabric,A little small but great quality. Very cute  top fits a bit small and short are kinda a low rise fit... but I love it anyway! Great fabric  well made,1
way more affordable,Great Fit!. This replacement brush heads are a great fit on my Oral B Pro Limited toothbrush. They are way more affordable than the Oral B ones. They work well  too. I am very pleased with them. My only issue is that they're not labeled well in my opinion. They have a code on them which identifies what they are  but that doesn't help unless you know the codes. I want to be able to quickly know which one is the softer  sensitive one VS which on is the deep clean. I think I'm just going to have to look them up and write on the packaging.,1
gardening,"Essential for Decorating Tips!. If you are looking for ideas for that next decorating project  more than likely you can find at least one article each month to inspire you. With a focus on friends and family  gardening  interior design  building  family matters  flood  good health and shopping  you can't go wrong!  I like the ""Yours for the Asking"" section where you can send away a postcard for more information instead of contacting each company.  For mom's  the ""kids project"" section will be amusing and your kids will love the ideas.  The cartoons are also cute and I had to laugh at the one that said: ""Of course I love you. Didn't you get my fax?""  Something about the pictures in this magazine always remind me of a bright sunny day. The open kitchens and lush gardens are just a treat to see.  The recipe section really has a personality all of its own. The ""Petite Caramel Apple"" recipe they had in the September 2001 issue was so adorable!  I look forward to every issue!  ~The Rebecca Review",1
easy to put together,Five Stars. I like how easy this was to put together. I also love all the compartments it features.,1
VERY happy,I was negative about these originally because of the HUGE Shipping price  BUT.... now that the almost $20 shipping charge has been corrected from what showed on my Amazon screen to a very reasonable amount   I am VERY happy with them and my cats LOVE them.,1
quick drying,Superb socks with extra cushioning stays in place while walking are also warm. I first bought a pair of these socks at REI for $27 and loved them. I wanted another color of the same sock so I purchased these. These socks are wonderful. They are slightly thick  sturdy  snug but not too tight  and feel fabulous on. They cushion my heel and bottom of foot and they do not move around like other socks  which helps prevent blisters. I walk a lot and these socks stay put even on a two-hour walk. I LOVE THEM.  One caveat  however. These socks must be an older model of the same sock that I purchased at REI. The reason I say that is because compared to the original sock I purchased  they are about two inches shorter. I then did some research and found a comparison chart for two of the same mountaineering socks by the same name. The only difference between the two models is that there's a slightly different fabric combination and it is not listed as quick drying.  To me both socks feel the same. I also ordered three more pairs. I now own five pairs of these socks and they are WONDERFUL! In fact  I love them so much that I ordered this [[ASIN:B01F47N7XK men's pair]] for my boyfriend. My boyfriend loves them as well. He wears them to bed.,1
stocking stuffers,It IS Perfect!!. I'm 62 and love this primer. That's why I'm here searching for more. If the price is right I may pick up a couple more for stocking stuffers.,1
compresses,This is very supportive. I do find it is a little snug  but it's supports very well.  I can't say if the copper does anything extra or not  but it is definitely snug and compresses.,1
bright and colorful,Fits perfectly. Bright and colorful. Purchased as a gift and it fit recipient's A11 like a glove. Its not going to provide the protection that some of the more serious  higher priced cases do  but something is better than nothing.,1
nostalgia trip,A Book That Stirs Memories.... Occasionally I finish a book that leaves me not wanting begin another  at least for a little while  because it really stays with me .I did not want to ruin the stirring feelings I had upon completing Nine  Ten. (This is out of the ordinary for me  as I normally start on another book the minute I finish one.)  It took me back to Before...My boys were four and two...and I remembered how different America was when they were small on September 10th...before.   Nine  Ten reminded me of what it's like to read historical fiction  good historical fiction  about the Titanic. When an author does as wonderful a job writing about a major event as Baskin does  you do not want to stop reading  even though you know what's coming. Even the author notes and  the acknowledgements  were heart- rending.   I have already recommended Nine  Ten to several people. I think this book would be a wonderful way to teach others about 9-11.It will probably be a nostalgia trip for parents of today  most of whom will remember Before...and how it was so different.,1
CD had copied meta data,"Many  Many Issues and Possibly a Fake Reproduction.. 3 of the 14 discs in this collection did not play in multiple CD players and would either not play at all or skip entirely. CD cover art and programs full of misspelling and/or incorrect information on mulitple albums  Box set was torn and I ordered as new. One CD had copied meta data so even though I was playing ""Please Please Me"" Album all the songs titles and album art displayed were from the ""Rubber Sole"" Album.  I truly believe the is a fake reproduction of the box set because there are just so many errors throughout this Beatles Box Set.",0
not bulky but still offers adequate protection,Great OtterBox Phone Case!. This case lives up to the OtterBox name. It fits well without interfering with the operation of the phone. The two tone colors is attractive. The phone case is comfortable to hold and easy to grip. It's not bulky  but still offers adequate protection. The only criticism that I have is that I find the little flap that covers the charging port to be annoying.,1
still going strong,Great!  This water flosser works great!. This water flosser works great! It does a great job of cleaner between teeth without irritating gums.  It has been in use for several months now and is still going strong.  I recommend this dental flosser  especially if you have braces or implants,1
disappointing,Don't bother. Bypass this option for an American company version. It was very disappointing  inaccurately described  and no full refund on returns.,0
candied cherry tomatoes,Fantastic blend of complete menus  seasonality  and international flavors. My friend and James Beard Award-winning cookbook author Meike Peters recently released her latest cookbook “365: A Year of Everyday Cooking and Baking” and graciously sent a copy to me here in Japan  where I eagerly pored over the gorgeous food photography with its tantalizing  jewel-like salads.  Meike’s cooking is very much guided by the seasonal calendar  and in “365”  you’ll find a year’s worth of complete menus (including salads  soups  pasta  sandwiches  vegetables  seafood  meat and sweets) that make the most of seasonal produce  marrying them with a range of international influences including hearty German fare  Middle Eastern  and Mediterranean flavors and inspirations.  With the falling of the leaves and the arrivals of colder weather and flurries  the recipes featuring bright  sunny citrus are a welcome respite. Dishes like Winter Caprese with Blood Orange  Beet and Mozzarella di Bufala  Spaghetti with Ricotta  Orange and Crispy Sage Chocolate and Orange Pannetone  and Sicilian Orange Salad with Olive Oil  Marjoram  and Flaky Sea Salt are sure to stave off winter colds and chase the winter blahs away with the generous amount of vitamin C.  Others like Potato and apple-stuffed cabbage rolls with Walnut Butter and Gruyere  German beef  beet and potato stew  and Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Shallots and Apple  provide stick-to-your-ribs comfort.  The salads are a particular delight  including the rainbow potato salad with radishes  shallot vinaigrette and poached eggs  beet and apple carpaccio with pomegranate  raw asparagus and peach salad with orange blossom water and pecorino  and rainbow potato and cucumber salad with dill-pistachio pesto that will bring a splash of color (and flavor!) to overcast days.  Seasonal ingredients are given light-handed treatments that allow their individual textures and delicate flavors to shine  like fresh strawberries with saffron-vanilla sugar  watermelon caprese with mozzarella di bufala  basil and mint  and squash pasta with orange  maple and sage.  If you are someone who  like me  can never seem to come up with a complete menu  that’s one of the beauties of 365: You can also use the weekly menu planner to come up with a seasonal balanced meal by combining the various options for a given week.  I was absolutely intrigued by the idea of candied cherry tomatoes slow roasted and tossed with olive oil  confectioner’s sugar  and herbs  they dissolve into a silky confit that is the perfect complement for fresh pasta and tiny basil. Plus the leftover oil and tomatoes make a fantastic dipping oil!  Measurements and temperatures are provided in both US / Imperial and metric.  This has become one of my favorite cookbooks of the last several years highly recommended.,1
gift for my mother,greatest hits. Bought it as a gift for my mother for Christmas  it was a big hit. She loves it and plays it all the time,1
educational,Best Food Connection Magazine!!!. The magazine is very educational as well as great menus that are very easy to follow. Would highly recommend to anyone that enjoys food with prep that is easy and ending result is delicious!!!,1
sizing off,Nice product  sizing off!. Product is well made  but sizing seems way off for women. I purchased the XS for women's size 6  and they are so tight that my toes are bent under and the ankle opening is unbearably  circulation-cuttingly tight. They looked like doll's socks  for real. Sent them back for a size small instead. My husband's XL fit perfectly for his size 10.5 shoes! Snug  but not uncomfortably so.,0
good product,Five Stars. good product I was pleased.  buy some seeds to go with it,1
riding challenges,A great game that brought back a lot of fond summer memories. I used to take riding lessons as a kid  and even now I can still remember the excitement of caring for and riding such wonderful horses. &quotHorse Illustrated: Championship Season&quot is as close to the real thing as you'll get: you get to groom  feed  tack and ride four different horses depending on skill level. On top of caring for your horse  you also have the option to watch several videos on equine care  first aid  and riding techniques. As if that wasn't enough  the game has a scavenger hunt and a trivia game as well. There are three different types of riding challenges: dressage  cross country and show jumping. There are four skill levels based on accumulated points (earned by completing the scavenger hunt  correct trivia answers  caring for and riding your horse. The courses become more difficult as you progress. The scenery is varied for each course and the music is pleasant enough. The four horses each have different strengths and personalities and respond a bit differently to each jump. There's even a commentator for all three challenges. The controls were easy to master and the highest difficulty level still eludes me  so there is plenty of learning curve and opportunity for replaying &quotChampionship Season.&quot The barn area was very well conceived--I could practically smell the hay and horse manure in the summer heat. The lounge area had a fridge  microwave  VCR and cupboards full of things to explore. The tack room had several saddles  bridles  and books to read  and in the feed room you get to sort out the exact amount of the proper feed (hay  corn  alfalfa) for your horse. You also clean stalls and water the horses. There are five stalls  the last occupied by a goat. Each horse has its own colour (Barney=red  Blaze=blue etc.) as do the stalls and bridles. This is a great game for kids (or adults!) who love horses and teaches some basics about horse anatomy and care  grooming (including how to braid manes and tails)  and stresses regular feedings and stall cleanings. Perfect for the child that begs for a horse...this teaches some degree of responsibility about how much work is involved in caring for a horse.,1
gum massaging nubs,"Excellent infant teether with gum massaging nubs drop resistant. There is one BPA-free silicone teether in this package. The silicone is super soft. I consider this cute and engaging. This is easy for the baby to grab and hold onto. It has no sharp edges or parts that can fall off. This is perfect as a teether and is one solid piece. I also love that the opposite side has nubs which act as a gum massaging / tooth cleaning ""tool."" As is typical  always supervise when the baby is using this. This is rated for 0 to 6 months.  This is made in China. The current price of $7.99 is competitively priced for this. It also comes in a nice giftable box. Overall  I consider this a great teether that is drop resistant and small enough for newborns. I had given one like this to my neighbor's infant and he absolutely loved it.",1
extra embellishments,High quality paper and printing. Highly recommended! Graphic 45 never disappoints. With their delux kits you get extra embellishments,1
no leaks,Really nice full face snorkel mask!. I have never tried a full face snorkel mask before (used to only covering my eyes with a foggy mask and have pipe which goes in my mouth). This was a little awkward to get used to but now I really like it. It fits well  no leaks  not overly constrictive on my face and I can snorkel for hours. I love the full viewing capability I get with this full face mask and I also love that it is GoPro compatible (I am planning to buy a GoPro camera in September when I go to the Caribbean). I will update this review to speak to the GoPro matching capability after I return. But  for a snorkel mask  this is really a great one!,1
shaped to be a like a defense shield,"Aromatic bars of ""Soap Shields"" that gently scrub & cleanse. These small bars of soap smell really good and perform well in terms of cleansing and not leaving skin feeling stripped. I like that they are made in USA  handmade in Ohio. These are not fancy soaps. They are small  but they are not necessarily travel sized. They just have a good size and shape that fits perfectly into the hand. That stood out to me on first use. I really like how well it fits in my hand. The bars are tear dropped or pear shaped. More specifically  it is shaped to be a like a defense shield. Get it?  As this is meant to be a bit of an immune defense/support item.  The bars are thin  but not fragile. I can palm it and easily rub it all over without it falling out of my hand. I have been using one bar on and off for a couple of weeks now  and it isn't just disappearing. There are six loose bars in a resealable bag.  The soap has a slight intentional grit to it . This adds some scrubbing action. Creates a nice lather and rinses well. The scent is an intriguing mix of essential oils. Clove  Cinnamon  Oregano  Peppermint  Parsley  Eucalyptus and Rosemary essential oils Not overpowering. Really quite nice.  It has been an odd  but unexpectedly pleasant product to use. The price is budget friendly. I find nothing bad about them or my experience so far. I may consider them again when I run out. I really think they are worth the try.  ""CLEAN INGREDIENTS - Our formula just 8 simple ingredients. Free from harsh chemicals that damage your skin like Sulfates  phthalates  parabens  or synthetic fragrances. It’s Vegan and never tested on animals.""",1
handsome bear,Very handsome bear!. Good cuddle-bear!,1
one unique brush for cheek highlighting,PU case really smells brushes are okay two brush heads frayed. There are 14 brushes in this set. There are brushes for foundation  blush  eyeshadow  eye blending (fan brush)  etc. In fact  there are more brushes than I needed.   The one unique brush in this set (see photo) is the one that looks like a paint brush. This is perfect for cheek highlighting.  The bristles are relatively soft but not as soft as I expected. They feel pretty good against my skin but not great. Also  the heads have a slight odor. The PU brush case has a tremendous chemical odor and needs to be aired out a while.  This is a bargain basement travel set for someone who is starting their make-up journey. The current price of $11.19 comes to $.80 cents per brush. In this case one gets what they pay for it's a marginal price for a marginal quality set that is functional. ,1
emotional,Good read. New author to me. This is a great read..emotional and heartwarming.,1
update my reviews,Pro floor cleaner. I have new vinyl floors and thought I try this.  Hope it works because I just got 3 giant bottles of is.  Having said that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars,Sugar and spice and everything nice!. Samantha Seneviratne’s “The New Sugar and Spice” takes classic comfort bakes like cinnamon rolls  cookies  breads and cheesecake and reinvents them  using seductive hits of spice in creative and crowd-pleasing ways. In the introduction  the author points out that “the flood of sugar has diluted real flavor  muffled complexity  and concealed true richness ” so her goal was to create delicious  healthier desserts that use spices in a starring role in place of the overwhelming sweetness so prevalent in many desserts.  Chapters are divided by spices (sometimes with complementary pairings)  including peppercorn and chile  cinnamon  nutmeg  clove and cardamom  ginger  and savory herbs and spices. Along the way  Samantha includes stories about her family’s roots and how her Sri Lankan heritage influenced her culinary style  along with fascinating historical insights and storage tips on the various featured spices.  Cinnamon  hazelnut and date buns  ricotta cheesecake with bourbon-raisin jam  orange and honey baklava  orange-clove pull-apart bread  and saffron currant braid were all recipes that instantly called my name. Several years ago  I became hooked on Scandinavian baking and now tend to use cardamom liberally in yeast rolls and sweet breads (even in my morning coffee)  so naturally I was thrilled to see a whole chapter starring my favorite spice!  Measurements are given in both volume and weight (which I appreciate as I find weight measurements to be more reliable). Samantha’s guidance is spot-on there are helpful hints both for new bakers as well as experienced ones to guarantee the best results  particularly for recipes involving yeast. Gorgeous photography by Erin Kunkel highlights various ingredients and finished bakes for maximum (mouth-watering!) impact.  In addition to familiar treats  you’ll find updated versions of international classics such as profiteroles  clafoutis and tarte tatin  Scandinavian bakes like saffron currant braids and cardamom-laced shortbread  Thai banana fritters  Indonesian kue lapis  Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars that are perfect for fall  and other fragrant  delightful baked goods that spiced up my rather predictable baking repertoire. As an experienced home baker  I appreciated the challenge and loved the complexity that the various spices gave to my baked goods and will certainly be baking my way through “The New Sugar and Spice in the near future!  (I received my copy through Blogging for Books),1
soft and comfy,Soft and comfy. This pajama set is super comfortable  very soft and stretchy so I could use it for breastfeeding. The top was shorter than I thought so I couldn’t really use it as a postpartum pajama in the hospital but it fits perfectly now that all the seeking has gone away.,1
different yet so familiar,like a forgotten dream. Having the basic heinz ketchup forever  this is so different yet so familiar...  Don't skimp on your ketchup--give this one a try. And to make an even better all around snack  get a french fry cutter [[ASIN:B00BAU4JIS French Fry Cutter - Simple  Handheld  Quick  and Easy]] and make your own fries!,1
good quality insole made with recycled materials,Great insole for foot comfort and great for the environment!. Good quality insole made with recycled materials. I've always loved Dr. Scholl's products and this insole is no exception. Soft yet firm  makes it so much easier for me to go through the day on my feet. I love the fact that it is made with recycled materials and is better for the environment. I will be using these going forward since I like them so much. Highly recommend.,1
Aspergers rocky adolescence,"""You have Asperger's. Asperger's doesn't have you."" Can I get an amen?. Rudy Simone's ""Aspergirls: Empowering Females With Asperger Syndrome"" is a wonderful starting point for all Aspergirls  whether you're an Aspergirl yourself or you have an Apergirl in your life. This thoughtfully-written guide examines the oft-overlooked Aspergirl  who's been clinically ignored in favor of male Aspies (traditional figures put the boy-girl ratio at 4:1  but that is rapidly changing as 1 in 100 children are believed to be on the autism spectrum). Because Aspergirls may be better at socializing in small doses and tend to be a little more expressive than their male counterparts  they may be able to ""pass"" as neurotypical (NT) and not receive a proper AS diagnosis other than being ""shy"" or ""difficult.""  Simone has interviewed numerous Aspergirls regarding their experiences in all walks of life  from surviving schoolyard bullies  PTSD  and selective mutism to college  dating  motherhood and employment. She also discusses the Asperger's ""is it a gift or a disability?"" debate. Each chapter ends with ""Advice to Aspergirls"" and ""Advice to Parents "" a thoughtful touch that includes the whole family in the discussion. The book wraps up with advice from Aspergirls to Aspergirls (inspirational bullet points such as the title of this review) and the cleverly-titled ""Give Your Aspergirl some B.A.L.L.S.: Belief  Acceptance  Love  Like  and Support."" Appendix A also features a handy chart of female Asperger traits and main female / male differences in Asperger's. There is a small list of references and resources  and I was surprised not to see any of Tony Attwood's books listed (although he's mentioned by name several times). Simone frequently promotes her own books [[ASIN:1849058032 22 Things a Woman Must Know: If She Loves a Man With Asperger's Syndrome]] and [[ASIN:1935274090 Asperger's on the Job: Must-have Advice for People with Asperger's or High Functioning Autism  and their Employers  Educators  and Advocates]] in nearly every chapter.  Simone and the various interviewees put Aspie sensations into words that NTs can understand this is in itself a feat  since our first language isn't words  but images and sensations (see [[ASIN:0307739589 Thinking in Pictures (Expanded  Tie-in Edition): My Life with Autism (Vintage)]]). Simone discusses triggers (fluorescent lights  loud noises  scratchy fabrics) and meltdowns in detail  both internally and externally. In the chapter on stimming  she introduces the term ""soothing "" which has fewer negative connotations.  There are several chapters devoted to depression  medication  abuse and PTSD. I was particularly interested in Chapter 19  Stomach Issues and Autism. I've had digestive issues my whole life  and never previously connected AS with digestive disorders. At times  the book went into New Age-y territory  with suggestions on herbal supplements and discussions on psychic sensitivity  reiki  and chi  along with several popular AS diets  including gluten-free and casein-free (see: [[ASIN:184310055X A User Guide to the GF/CF Diet for Autism  Asperger Syndrome and AD/HD]] for more information).  When I was younger  Aspergers wasn't ever mentioned and hadn't gained the widespread recognition that it currently has. I sincerely wish that this book had been available throughout my rocky adolescence hopefully  ""Aspergirls"" will smooth the path for today's young Aspergirls. If you're the parent of an Aspergirl  some of the stories in this book are on the lower-functioning end of the Aspergers scale don't automatically assume that your daughter will exhibit *all* of these symptoms. Every Aspergirl is different. Just be proud of your smart  funny  and talented daughter. Or if you're an Aspergirl yourself...Aspergrrrrrl power!",0
brighter box like orange or red,It wasn't worth it !!. Well it was worth a shot ! But I gotta pass cause as you can see from beginning to end the last photo its not looking good   my plant arrived in bad shape and the driver left the box upside down ( no way to tell which end was up ) after getting it planted I was hoping it would make it 😬but its dieing 😭slowly its going the process of shipping was just to hard for it so I wont be continuing my Subscription 😞 2 leafs left barely hanging on !! I really think the care given to the plant during shipping was crap ! Maybe a brighter box like orange or red with a warning or fragile ! For shippers to take notice idk but the box was just thrown around like all the rest ! The box was dented   you could see it was not handled well ! So try the service if you want but thats my story 🙏🌿🌱🌵🍀🙏,0
Elmer's Tune,A pairing made in heaven.... Long before she became known as a sultry sex kitten with 1950's smash hit Fever  Peggy Lee had practiced her sexier side with Benny Goodman on hits such as Why Don't You Do Right. Lee received her big break in 1941 when Benny Goodman heard her sing his vocalist Helen Forrest was about to leave his band  and he was looking for a replacement. A few days later  Lee recorded Elmer's Tune  the first track on The Complete Recordings 1941-1947. That same year  several more of Lee/Goodman's arrangements went on to be hits  including I Got It Bad and Winter Weather.  The Complete Recordings gathers 38 tracks by Lee and Goodman  despite the fact that Lee married Goodman's guitarist Dave Barbour and took a year off  returning to work on her solo career with Barbour (in 1945  she signed a solo contract with Capitol). 32 of the tracks were recorded between 1941 and 1942 and displayed Peggy Lee's widening range to perfection  from blues (Blues in the Night)  ballads (How Deep is the Ocean?  How Long Has This Been Going On?  When the Roses Bloom Again  Where or When  The Way You Look Tonight)  holiday tunes (Winter Weather)  uptempo numbers (Let's Do It  The Freedom Train)  and everything in between. It's amazing to hear how she matures from that first jittery performance on Elmer's Tune to the confident vocalist she'd become.  The remastering has produced a crisp  clear sound  and the discs are printed to look like the old vinyl labels that Columbia's used with Frank Sinatra reissues. The excellent liner notes are by the incomparable Will Friedwald  who writes for all the Sinatra Columbia / Capitol reissues and releases  and include rare photos and a complete list of original catalog numbers  recording dates  and studio personnel. This is a fabulous investment for fans of Big Band (Goodman in particular) and Peggy Lee  but any fan of the Great American Songbook and music of the 1940s will find much to enjoy here.,1
Quality is as expected for price,Acceptable for price.. Bought 2 packs.  Adhesion could be better. Strap length could be longer.  Quality is as expected for price. Works reasonably for our needs.,1
made of all plant-based ingredients,Lightweight moisturizer absorbs rapidly leaves skin moderately hydrated smells lemony. Even though this is baby lotion  I got this for me. This moisturizer is lightweight  slightly creamy  absorbs rapidly  and leaves my skin moderately hydrated. Since it is lightweight  it is a perfect summer lotion. To my senses  it has a mild lemony fragrance even though that is not listed in the ingredients. This is made of all plant-based ingredients (see photo). The current price of $16 is competitive but pricey for this 6.7 ounce tube.,0
Ce n'était qu'un rêve,A good introduction to Céline's earlier works. Long before Beauty and the Beast and her first English-language albums  Céline was already a star in her native Québec. She has been recording albums since 1981  and until a few years ago her earliest albums were only  available on records. But 19 songs from 1981-1988 are now available on this  collection  including the rarest  Ce n'était qu'un rêve. Céline's mother  wrote the song for her twelve-year old daughter and it was this song that  joined Céline's destiny with that of her husband and manager René  Angélil.   Many of Céline's early hits are featured here  including  D'amour ou d'amitié and Ne partez pas sans moi. Also included are a number  of B-sides (the rare L'amour viendra  Visa pour les beaux jours  etc.) and  the complete lyrics to each song. Sorry  no translations are given in the  CD booklet.  This is an excellent CD for fans of Céline to become  aquainted with her earlier works en français. It is well worth the price.  Do yourself a favour and buy this CD today!,1
conflict wraps up perfectly,Sweet. Sweet  simple and clean historical romance. Young orphaned woman becomes a mail order bride for a jaded man who wants a stand in mother for his orphaned ward. A small amount of suspense  very little romance  no intimacy but it was okay. There is a happily ever after and as expected every conflict wraps up perfectly in the end.,1
most used,Dewalt Max Lithium-Ion 4 tool set. My husband is a project manager.  Uses Dewalt tools every day and for many  many years.  While this kit is NOT the most powerful tools Dewalt offers  he says that they are perfectly fine for home use.  Further he believes that the tool bag is worth it's weight in gold.  It keeps tools readily available and is handy to use in carrying the tools to your project area.  I have to admit most of the men I've seen looking over the tools are ooing and ahing over the actual tool bag.  We purchased this on &#34Prime Sale Day&#34 and my husband believes that we paid a fair sale price.  While it wasn't a &#34steal&#34 it was well worth the money spent.  Everything listed was included... and interestingly the piece that my husband thought he would not use much has turned out to be the most used at this time - the flashlight!  The tools are fairly heavy pieces so I am not sure I will be used them as a girl (ha) but they are certainly doable.  I always update my reviews if new info would be helpful.  Finally  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.,0
fit perfectly in the machine,Flexibility To Our Brewing !. These MaxRona reusable K cups are exactly what we needed for our Keurig brewer. They're simple to use  fit perfectly in the machine and allow us to brew whatever coffee/tea we want-we're not tied down to buying K cup pods only for our machine.  They do not  in any way  change the flavor of the beverage being brewed in the brewer.  Every cup we brew is delicious and perfect.  While the reusable K cups are dishwasher safe  our is broken so I hand wash them after each use. They clean well with no issues.  I love the flexibility of being able to brew anything we want that comes with these reusable K cups.  They're wonderful but if you're not satisfied  MaxRona offers a 100% money back or replacement guarantee!,1
spiced pumpkin filling,Make showstopping desserts on your countertop with minimal effort!. I’m a fairly recent convert to the slow cooker bandwagon I only purchased my first slow cooker a couple of years ago and started out by baking my way through all the desserts in Michele Scicolone’s excellent “The Mediterranean Slow Cooker ” which introduced me to the joys of making flan  cheesecake  and fruit compote in the slow cooker.  Fast forward several years later and I was looking to expand my slow cooker desserts repertoire  so imagine my delight when I got an e-mail from Lisa Ekus that highlighted “Slow Cooker Desserts” by Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore! Roxanne and Kathy are cookbook authors  food consultants  cooking teachers and food bloggers who have written seven cookbooks and a popular blog  www.pluggedintocooking.com.  As soon as my copy of “Slow Cooker Desserts” arrived  I couldn’t wait to dig in to the many inviting recipes covering not only cakes and cheesecakes  but also bread puddings  fruits  and candy and fondues. The book opens with a good compact guide to slow cookers  bakeware  and ingredients. The layout is uncluttered and straightforward  and each recipe is followed by helpful tips  making it perfect for novice bakers. The gorgeous photography by Jennifer Davick deserves a special mention as well.  The first recipe I tried was the Praline-Pumpkin Cheesecake. I decided to substitute a gingersnap crust for the graham crackers  and it added the perfect touch of spice to complement the spices in the cheesecake filling. Note that you do need to blind bake the gingersnap crust prior to baking in the slow cooker  but this only adds a few minutes to the prep time. Also  perhaps it was the brand of gingersnaps I used  but I would recommend adding a little extra melted butter until the crust comes together – the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter for ½ cup crumbs. One thing I would suggest is to also liberally spray the sides of your springform pan as well – mine is supposedly nonstick  but I followed the recipe (which only specifies to spray the bottom of the pan) and a large portion of my cheesecake edges stuck and broke. I normally do spray the entire pan with Baker’s Joy  but I follow the recipes as written when I am testing for reviews.  The finished cheesecake texture is very fluffy and a bit crumbly  so I did have difficulty cutting it neatly I’m not sure if I may have beat TOO much air into my filling and will beat for less next time. The praline topping (made in the microwave in under three minutes) is destined to become my new secret weapon in the kitchen! This homemade caramel was delicious and deceptively easy and would also make a great addition to ice cream or cakes. All combined (gingersnap crust  spiced pumpkin filling  praline topping)  this is a great fall dessert with minimal effort and also frees up your oven for other baking tasks.  The second recipe I tried was the candied cranberry and crystallized ginger chutney this one called my name because I am a certified fiend when it comes to candied ginger. I had a bag of organic cranberries in the freezer that I was looking to use up  so it worked out perfectly that I already had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry (even the ginger liqueur!). My bag of organic cranberries was slightly smaller than the 16-oz. bag called for in the recipe  so I scaled back on the sugar quite a bit as I was using candied ginger (I used ¾ cup sugar in place of the 1 ¼ in the recipe  and it was plenty sweet for me). It also had the bonus of making my kitchen smell amazing as it cooked! I cooked mine down for a little longer the recipe says that it should be thin  but I like my chutney on the very thick side more like a compote. The recipe calls for between 5 to 7 hours on low and I ended up cooking mine for 3 hours on high due to time. This would be fantastic stirred into yogurt  as an accompaniment to Indian food  or even as a side dish in place of jellied cranberries or cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.  The third recipe was the chocolate cashew clusters. I’d seen slow cooker candy (including nut clusters) pop up in my Facebook feed  but I’d never tried making it before. The recipe uses salted cashews  semisweet and milk chocolate chips  a dark chocolate candy bar  and candy coating to create decadent nut clusters that look like they came from a candy shop. These take about 1 ½ hours on low plus cooling / set time (3 to 5 hours).  Other recipes on my to-make list from “Slow Cooker Desserts” include the cinnamon-calvados applesauce  rice pudding with cherries  and many of the cheesecakes (brownie chunk  German chocolate  ginger-peach  coconut cream) and cakes (cider-glazed apple-walnut cake  Southern sweet potato cake  pineapple butter cake). There is enough variety and possible variations (I need to find a way to make a cookie butter cheesecake!) to keep you happily baking for months to come.  (Thank you to Lisa Ekus for the review copy!),1
doesn't fold like some of the more expensive Stagg Hercules stands,good stand. This has the largest top of any of my stands  and it is the one I use when traveling / gigs. The top doesn't fold like some of the more expensive Stagg  Hercules stands  so if you're using it for gigging  that may be something to consider. I have to lug an 88key weighted piano around  so don't mind lugging this.,0
great music,Grease. Good girl meets bad boy.... high school.... fast cars...great music you can sing along.  What's not to like??  I actually got this movie because my 5 year old grandson has recently &#34discovered&#34 musicals and I thought he would like this one with the car races.  I wasn't work.  We sing it AND dance it out.  Awesome fun. Worth owning.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful  nor do I shy away from answering comments/questions.  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.  My purchases are VERIFIED  FULL price and 100% independent.  As are my reviews!  They are fully my opinion  which could differ from yours - and that's ok.  Happy shopping!,1

put it together,Didn't realize how handy This would become. I have a lot of puzzle Boards  Caddies for the puzzle pieces and even Added a lazy Susan to my original puzzle board. I didn't realize how much I needed this box holder as well !!! Lol. With most puzzles you get a poster to help you And for that I use a recipe holder. Who the thought there'd be so many things for puzzles but you need them all. This 1 is very light wood and very well made. And since it's for puzzles you have to put it together. .... Pretty smart. I would advise every puzzle lover to get one of these. And maybe some extras for gifts..people will be so happy to get one and thank you when they realize how they need it.,1
look nice,Pretty bright colors. These are very cute hummingbirds. They are made out of a tin But they are sturdy. I hung mine outside and they look nice especially when the sun shines on them.,1

maneuverability is more important,Great light walker. I LOVE this walker  it squeezes into tight spots and its light enough for me to throw it in the back seat of the car.  Some people won't like it because you can't sit on it but so far I don't need to sit on it and the maneuverability is more important...,1
Peter Cetera,Chicago 18  the first post-Cetera album. Peter Cetera is gone  long gone  off to pursue his solo career.  Did he leave on his own  or was he pushed out the door?  It's never been clearly explained as far as I can tell  but it was obviously not a happy parting of the ways.  This was the band's first LP  post-exit  and the front cover design is that of a snake shedding its skin.  Anything to do with Cetera?  Anyway  things aren't pretty.  Jason Scheff seems lightweight and tentative as Peter's replacement  Robert Lamm appears to have retreated into the shadows  and Bill (Mr. BLOOZE) Champlin over-sings anything and everything that comes his way.  The record's first single  an inexplicable remake of 25 or 6 to 4  bombed and threatened to take the album with it.  Will You Still Love Me?  That one saved the day but pretty much locked the band into its seemingly permanent power ballad phase.  Producer David Foster plays down the group's vaunted horn section and utilizes a lot of outside-the-band songwriters for material.  Like I said  it ain't pretty.  Two-and-one-half horns.  Recommended to diehards and Chicago completists  like yours truly.  This review is centered on the Rhino Flashback reissue.,0
accurate,Easy to use and accurate. 5 stars easy to use and accurate. In these times it makes life easier to be worry free.,1
ears have nubs,"Excellent infant teether with gum massaging nubs drop resistant. There is one BPA-free silicone teether in this package. The silicone is super soft. I consider this cute and engaging. This is easy for the baby to grab and hold onto. It has no sharp edges or parts that can fall off. This is perfect as a teether and is one solid piece. I also love that the ears have nubs which act as a gum massaging / tooth cleaning ""tool."" As is typical  always supervise when the baby is using this. This is rated for 0 to 12 months.  This is made in China. The current price of $6.29 ($6.99 minus 10%) is competitively priced for this. Overall  I consider this a great teether that is drop resistant and small enough for newborns. I had given one like this to my neighbor's infant and he absolutely loved it.",1
Amazon packages the card and mails it snail mail,Who doesn’t love a gift card?. An Amazon gift card is the perfect gift for anyone young to old  I dig how Amazon packages the card and mails it snail mail so that I do not have to! Electronic e-gift cards rule too  but more often than not  I prefer to have a physical card mailed to the recipient.,1
bargain,Lightweight  but roomy (and a bargain for weekend warriors). This is gig-worthy for weekend warriors and folks who handle and manage their own set up and tear down. It is NOT roadworthy for the traveling musician. But for the price that is to be expected. For the weekend warriors this is an absolute bargain in my opinion.  I was inspired to pick this up based on how pleased I am with the first case from this company that I purchased: [[ASIN:B00F3E8F6E CNB PDC-410C Black Locking Aluminum Pedal Case]]. Like that case there are a few things I do not especially care for with this one. Specifically  the  hinge assemblies and the Velcro strip that is included. The hinge assemblies can get stuck removing or replacing the lid. The adhesive side of the Velcro strip does not always hold  and the hook side does not firmly catch the thin  felt like material in the lid. However  I know about those issues from the first model I purchased and can live with them.  This one is now housing a [[ASIN:B0035JI8J8 Boss ME25 Guitar Multi-Effects Pedal]]  a remarkably small [[ASIN:B00YTNY17W Hotone Mojo Diamond 5 Watt Mini Guitar Amplifier Head]]  a [[ASIN:B002TUTUIM TC-Helicon VoiceTone Harmony-G XT Vocal Effects Processor]]  and another pedal (a [[ASIN:B00X3IY3D6 Hotone TPSWOOD Wood Guitar Effects Pedal]]. All fit with room to spare. Incredibly  the little Hotone amp head easily fit with the lid closed.  It may not be built like a tank  but is more than sturdy enough for folks who carry their own gear and are careful to not sling it around or otherwise mistreat it. Plus  there are strap buttons (similar to a guitar's buttons) that allow you to add a carrying strap if needed. For the price you will be hard pressed to find a more functional case from a space perspective.,1
bit softer than the ones meant for older babies,They work.. These are the newborn pacifiers so they are a bit softer than the ones meant for older babies. I like to attach them to something because when they get dropped(or thrown) you'll be surprised and aggravated at the distance these things get when they roll-wow!!!! So many of them lost  maybe I should switch to the square ones lol,1
good for teaching musical concepts,Good for teaching musical concepts. I am using this with a pre-school class where I teach music once a week. This drum is good for teaching concepts of beat and rhythm  and it’s sturdy enough to be passed around the class. It also has a good  mellow sound.,1
tooth fell out,turned out AOK after all. my cats sniffed them but didnt chew them ....  i unfortunately cant eat them to give a good review  LOL  I guess they will play with them  or ill throw them outside maybe the possums will eat them  UPDATE one of my cats chews them but she's young the older cat  chewed on one and a tooth fell out  LOL i sent a pack to my friend who has a LOT of cats and they are happy,0
Lacrosse,SI for Kids. I've been buying this for a10 year old and very sports minded grandson for a couple of years. He plays football  basketball and Lacrosse........,1
light floral scent,Light Floral Scent. This fragrance has a light floral scent. I normally don't like floral scents  but this one is pleasant. The petals are a great way to try out scents. The towelettes are basically one time use. They're not wet and overly saturated  but they do transfer the fragrance to wherever you wipe them. These are perfect for traveling! I'm putting  a few of these in my 19 year old daughter's stocking this Christmas!,1
addition to puzzles,Animal Crossing Vibe. This cat island puzzle has an Animal Crossing vibe to it. The image is fun and colorful  plus it has lots of cats! The pieces are a good size and cut well. I didn't notice any puzzle dust. I did not care for the company logo being on the back of every piece. That actually made it a little more difficult to sort because you had to look at both sides to make sure you were putting the right side up. It doesn't come with a poster of the image either. I really appreciate that addition to puzzles. It's a pain to have to hold the box in your hand just so you can see where things go. The full image is on the bottom of the box. The lid has a blown up picture that doesn't show everything. Plus  the brand logo is on both of the images. They really are pushing their logo on us!! They do include a business card size picture of the puzzle but that's really impossible to use because it's so small.,0
work great so far,USB C cords. If you just purchased the latest gen of android cell phone (for me  the Samsung S10+) you will need a new type of charging cords... they do charge on the cord free units - but if you're away from those  you will need these cords.  There is also a micro usb to usb C adapter - will save you a few bucks - but eventually you'll want new cords. These work great so far - however  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
mid-'50s to late '60s,Britain does it again!. What started out as a uniquely American genre  that of blues  soul  and gospel  has somehow managed to become the creative property of Britain ... ever since the decline of classic Motown  Britain has been churning out an amazingly talented bunch of blue-eyed soul singers and blues musicians. One of the more recent additions is James Hunter  who first burst onto the scene under the stage name Howlin' Wilf in the 1980s ([[ASIN:B000HOJNI4 Cry Wilf!]]). His several solo recordings are strongly influenced by R&B  early rock and roll  and soul. His 1994 debut Believe What I Say includes guest performances by Van Morrison (Hunter also appeared on several of Van's albums during the '90s and was part of Morrison's Rhythm & Blues Revue).  Believe What I Say opens with the jivin' Two Can Play  with its sassy staccato sax riffs punctuating this tale of infidelity. Hunter's smooth  sensual update of torch song The Very Thought Of You comes off as more late-night smoky jazz  with a delivery that Ray Charles would be proud of. Turn On Your Love Light features a smokin' duet with Van Morrison.  One of the few covers is Ray Charles' Hallelujah I Love Her So. Compared to Charles' original  which leaned towards Big Band brassy  Hunter's backing saxes sound the same on every track  and I felt the instrumentals lacking punch in the first half  but the bridge (with guitar) redeems the song and gospel feeling creeps in toward the finale.  Out of Sight is a tight soul ditty that pays homage to James Brown with its knockout brass/drum punches. Hear Me Calling has some hand-waving gospel vibes going  complete with call-and-response chorus.  The majority of the songs sound like they could have come off the radio from the mid-'50s to late '60s. They're pleasant enough  but the sameness of the backing detracts from the potential to differentiate between tracks. Hunter's writing chops create songs that feel authentically retro. His singing voice combines elements of Ray Charles and Sam Cooke  and his guitar shows heavy influence from Chuck Berry and legendary blues guitarists such as B.B. King.  Hunter has continued to polish his sound on his subsequent solo releases [[ASIN:B0000259AM Kick It Around]] and [[ASIN:B000E1NX1S People Gonna Talk]]  but it's enjoyable to hear his first solo work after his turn with Howlin' Wilf and the Vee-Jays. He's one of the most authentic of the current crop of blue-eyed soul artists  and really inhabits that long-lost R&B/soul/blues era as if it were only yesterday instead of decades ago.,1
right insert kept folding over,Attractive swimsuit with easy closing neck clasp but the bra inserts do not say put. This is an attractive suit that I found just a bit tricky to get into. I like the easy closing clasp around the neck. The straps in the back can get a bit tangled when putting this on but straighten out once pulled up to the neckline. This suit does not have any type of control built in  so one's shape shows as is--fully tummy and all. What I do not like is the bra inserts. On the one I received  the right insert kept folding over and it was difficult to straighten out. Personally  I do not like inserts of any kind in a bathing suit or bra. However  if they stayed in place that would be acceptable  but these do not. It is mainly for this reason that an otherwise attractive suit is a disappointment to me.  The label recommends hand washing only and line drying. I always machine wash items like this in a lingerie bag and hang dry.,0
nothing really new or inspiring,Redundant glad I bout at a discounted price. I didn’t find this to live up to its name. Nothing really new or inspiring. Didn’t find a single project that I wanted to jump up and do and found the issues repetitive. Havind said all that  I will note that if your cash flow is better than mine you may find it more to your liking but I’m definitely a design on a dime type who loves repurposing salvage and the likes. To each their own! Just not my bag.,0
anhyzer release,"Awesome Disc. I beat my old distance record on the very first throw with this disc. It feels great in the hand. It's pretty stable right now  but I'm hoping it develops a bit more turn as it breaks in. I was mostly throwing hyzers  and it kept a straight line very well. My last throw of the night had a bit of an anhyzer release  and it WENT. It ended up next to a building that I thought was way out of my range. I was saying ""holy balls"" over and over again  and a park ranger felt the need to ask if I was OK. Great disc.",1
sound is clear,"Not what I was expecting - Ok  but overpriced. First the disclaimer that I got this in the Vine program. That being said  I always try to be fair  honest and objective in my reviews. That being said  I am a little disappointed in this Sharp system. As the ad specified this was good for small spaces  I set it up in my bedroom (as I have a 32"" Samsung flatscreen there with no additional sound support). Here are the pros: Set up was not difficult (although it did take me close to an hour to do by myself with the instructions). Sound is clear  bass tones are adjustable and I found the overall quality sufficient for a small/medium sized room. Here are the cons: First  as another reviewer has written  the fan in the bass unit is audible. Make sure you set it somewhere further enough away from where you are sitting or you will be distracted (regardless of how loud you set the speaker) by the hum. The other thing I wish Sharp would have done is make this a wireless device. I think this is why it took me so long to set it up trying to hide/wind the wires inside the carpeting so as not to be seen. To me  wireless is the way to go particularly with a sound system. I actually had bought another unit for a set up in my den http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MME6S4/ref=wms_ohs_product which is a Panasonic. Cost half the price of this unit and I honestly prefer it over the Sharp. Shop around  this is overpriced for what you can get elsewhere.",1
Blu ray version,VHS to Blu ray. Classic Classic Classic I got my kids to like this movie from the VHS version (i remember old fireside theater).  had to get the Blu ray version as our DVD had died (scratches from too many viewings and kids not putting it up correctly).  dang this is still funny. the quality seems a bit better (only a flesh wound).  you can't go wrong with this movie. but as my wife says... its more a guys thing (except my daughter likes it).,0
Works well,Works well. this is a good thermostat for the price.  It works well.  Keeps the lizard dude nice and toasty.,1
Copper synth and Silver synth removed from application,Great for new users  lousy for upgraders. In the past I have used several versions of Magix Music Maker  including version 7  2005  and 10. Each has been a steady progression of improvement and capability  so I was quite eager to see how much new stuff was added when I upgraded from version 10 to version 14. I was surprised not so much by the new capabilities but by how much has been removed.  The overall application is similar to Sony Acid or even Audacity - it is a loop-based music composition and production tool. The main production board allows for up to 96 tracks  which is a generous amount and should be plenty for all but the most complex and lengthy of tracks. There are a large number of production tools that allow for all manner of effects and edits  giving a near limitless supply of tweaks and edits that can be made to a track.  The new interface (as compared to version 10 which is my reference point) is sleek and user friendly  although the learning curve for an application of this type is understandably steep. Most functions are relatively straightforward  but some do require a jaunt through the user manual which is included in PDF form in the installation directory.  There is a generous supply of good-quality loops  though users of previous versions have seen some of these in the past. For a new user  though  there's a lot to choose from.  The VSTi interface is vastly improved and updated  making it not only a lot more user friendly but a lot more stable too. A new synth is included  the Vita. This supposedly take place of the guitar and grand piano synths  though I have not worked enough with it to replicate those sounds. I have monkeyed with it enough to make some interesting sounds  though  and overall I think it's a good synth.  Magix has done a nice job of better integrating their tools  which is a step forward. The only problem there is that sometimes users of previous versions may struggle to find some of the tools they want or need. Such is the case with me  though I found most of what I sought. Most - not all. This is where I noticed something unpleasant.  Music Maker 10 came with a wonderful tool called the Music Editor  which is a waveform editor with some other useful functions. I used this more than Music Maker itself. I was anxious to see how it had changed and when I looked for it I could not find it. What I did find  in the help file  was an occasional reference to it including a menu selection for locating it. The selection did not exist. After digging deeper I found that Magix stripped out the Music Editor and it is available as an upgrade to the Producer Edition - which you can ONLY get through the Magix website. Another $30 and you can have what used to be included.  Also gone are the Copper synth and the Silver synth. I used to use the Copper quite frequently and that one will be missed. I do not understand why it was removed  having been in the application for many iterations.  For a new user  Music Maker 14 packs a lot of goodies into the package and is a great starting point. For upgraders  though  it is a disappointment  with the smell of being a play for additional fees (much like activating the MP3 plug-in). This will be my last Magix purchase  based on the change in packaging and pricing  though I like the program itself. Hopefully Magix will realize that alienating long-standing customers is a poor strategy and will include the missing pieces in the regular edition again.,0
size of the tote is decent,A lovely leather tote!. This tote by Pascado is nice. It is rugged and well made. There are shoulder straps (two sizes). The leather is an orangey-brown  which will match most outfits. The inside of the bag is lined. There are two front pockets (magnetic closures) and a rear zippered one. There are also two side pockets which are useful if you want to slip an umbrella inside. The size of the tote is decent and can hold a variety of items (essentials and a small electronic). *The electronics I would consider are a small iPad mini or Kindle. Either would fit fine. The front or side pockets can hold a small cell phone or keys. I have a OnePlus cell phone that fits fine. And finally  I love that this company always encloses a nice “thank you letter ” which is a great touch! I’d recommend this tote.,1
Great size product,I love Snuggle - only brand I use. I exclusively use Snuggle as my brand of choice in fabric softeners. Not only is economical to use (a little goes a long way in my HE machine)  but my clothes come out soft and smelling wonderful. When used on my bedding  I can smell the fresh scent days into use. I highly recommend Snuggle for everyone. Great size product  great price and the best on the market when it comes to softening and freshening everything.,1
no chalky aftertaste,Great tasting  super quick acting relief!. I love Soundhealth products and these antacid chews are some of the best. First  forgetting the fact that they are a great antacid product  quickly relieving heartburn  they are also great tasting with no chalky aftertaste (like Tums). Then  to make it even sweeter  they are even less expensive then my regular antacid I get at CVS. I am sold on these chews and will never go back to other products again!,1
crystals are a pretty touch,"very heavy. This bracelet is pretty  but very heavy.  I used a link removal kit I received with a different bracelet as even the ""hers"" version was quite large.  In any case... I can't really say that the magnets are helpful... but I am ""testing.""  This particular bracelet doesn't have super strong magnets at all - if that matters to you.  The crystals are not all the way around the wrist... but almost and they are a pretty touch. There are some ""blanks"" so you can remove the non stone links.  The fastner is sturdy and latches securely. It came in a very lovely gift box with bow  so gift ready if that matters to you. It arrived quickly (we have prime) and in good condition.  I will update if there are any wear or other issues.",1
works great,Works great. Works great  easy to clean & good for the environment,1
match what we had bought at Costco,Nice ...but expensive.... We had to buy these to match what we had bought at Costco.  These were double the Costco price but had to match.,1
had no interest,Too big for my dog  might work well for others. Way too big for my 35 lb. Aussie Shepherd  I honestly thought  when I opened the package  that I was opening something that came from Jurassic Park  lol. Anyway  my dog snubbed her nose at this. I thought maybe she would at least make an attempt to lick or do something with it  but she had no interest. I ended up giving it to my next door neighbor's dog (a full size bulldog mix) who did seem to enjoy it. It did break up as he gnawed on this and I am not sure if that could present a choking hazard for some dogs. Please be sure your dog is large enough to handle this before ordering. I would say 80+ lbs for a dog for sure.,0
big hit,Nice Kenyan Flag Bracelet. I wish I could get a variety of flags for bracelets.  I'm teaching a country unit.  This Kenyan bracelet of it's flag was a big hit!,1
good support,Good support but VERY WIDE. Seem like the have good support but they are VERY VERY WIDE and I have very wide feet but they push the arches of shoes out but I will continue to use them to see how they feel. Seem good though,1
great gift for new bakers,"A handy  well-designed collection of both baking classics and new favorites. I have about 50 baking books ranging the gamut from heritage recipes like [[ASIN:1579125883 Heirloom Baking with the Brass Sisters: More than 100 Years of Recipes Discovered from Family Cookbooks  Original Journals  Scraps of Paper  and Grandmother's Kitchen]] to regional baking of Italy  France  Turkey  and Mexico. When I saw the Taste of Home Baking book  I jumped at the chance to review it.  The recipes come in a sturdy three-ring binder with a removable plastic splashguard. I loved the idea of the splashguard  although I would have liked to see a notes section at the back. The inside covers contain a handy list of food equivalents and ingredient substitutions  and the primer on baking basics is illustrated with numerous color photos.  Index:  Cookies Cakes Bars Cupcakes Cheesecakes Pies and tarts Desserts Quick Breads Muffins  Biscuits  and Scones Yeast Breads Yeast Rolls Coffee Cakes and Sweet Rolls Almost Homemade Trimmed-Down Favorites Holiday Classics  Each recipe has a short comment or introduction by its author  along with the author's name and hometown. The recipe ingredients are printed in an easy-to-read bold font  and steps are clearly numbered. There is no nutritional info provided.  You'll find plenty of familiar favorites here  along with some new and intriguing combinations. For years  our family made snowballs  a nut-and-butter cookie with a hidden Hershey's Kiss in the center. I found an instant new favorite in the chocolate macadamia meltaways a similar idea  except that you make chocolate-and-macadamia centers  chill them  then wrap the macadamia butter dough around them and bake.  For those who have always wanted to try working with yeast  but found it intimidating  this is the perfect guide to demystify the process. There are several chapters on yeast breads  yeast rolls  and sweet rolls  and each chapter opens with a sidebar containing helpful hints. There is a whole page of color photos with step-by-step illustrations of kneading  shaping  and baking yeast bread  tips and troubleshooting for baking in bread machines  how to shape bagels  pretzels  cloverleaf rolls  and more.  If you're in a time crunch  the ""Almost Homemade"" chapter uses box mixes with personalized touches to create quick (and giftable) creations. The ""Trimmed Down"" chapter includes low-fat  egg-free  gluten-free and lactose-free recipes. Holiday recipes features kid-friendly favorites  mostly decorated sugar cookies (boneyard cookies  shamrock cookies  shortbread ornament cookies  etc.).  This is a great go-to baking reference that covers all major baking categories with step-by-step guidance and plenty of photos. It would make a great gift for new bakers (or college students)  since most ingredients are easy to find and there are many simplified recipes that require little time and few ingredients. To sweeten the deal  the book also comes with a free one-year subscription to [[ASIN:B004GVZUU4 Taste of Home (1-year auto-renewal)]].",1
toy bar is also removable,Works well from birth to sitting up. Nice looking.. This fisher Price curve bouncer is great from  birth to learning to sit up. It has one mode that vibrates to sooths the baby. Good for either a girl or boy. Light weight as well. Easy to take with you. The toy bar is also  removable. A all around good bouncer  and good price.,1
convenient,Very convenient. Very convenient,1
lost tweezers,Fun w resin crafts!. Seriously. I bought these bc they popped upon sale while I was looking at resin or resin molds. I had no earthly idea what it was even for! Lol. It’s a total impulse buy.  That said I am very happy with it. Though I’ve already lost my tweezers. I think I accidentally threw them out with my used resin cups. I put some infuse my resin jewelry around some dried flowers & it’s just lovely. It was my very first foray into resin jewelry. I’ll try to post the pic. It’s super easy to work with & I have no idea what to use the rest for. It’s a lot of product. Pleasantly surprised with this purchase.,0
legs on to my low slung couch,Fantastic!. Got the legs on to my low slung couch.  Went on very nicely.  So nice to have a little more height.  Good product all wood which was important.  Very sturdy,1
loofah,This is a great gift set!!!!. This gift set is a steal at under $25. It contains deep moisture body wash  deodorant dry spray  Intensive Repair Shampoo  Intensive Repair Conditioner  Macadamia and Rice Milk Body Polish and a loofah. If you were to purchase all of these separately you would run over $40. I love the way my skin feels after using these in the shower and part of my morning routine for the past month now. I particularly love the body polish. I highly recommend and can say with the boxing  this would make a fantastic present for the holidays. Highly recommend!,1
takes some measuring,Matches my Moen faucet color perfect.. Very well made. Takes some measuring but very sturdy when you get it attached to the wall.,1
not look as full and vibrant as the picture,Cheap cheap cheap cheap material. This does not look as full and vibrant as the picture! This is poorly constructed and entirely not flattering to anybody type! The material is so thin that you can see right through it and the feel of it just makes you break out in a rash just by looking at it before you even put it on. This is grotesque and if you cannot pronounce the name of the company you should not buy!,0
erases well,Great Sketch Pads!. My 21 year old son loves to draw. He does mostly pencil drawings. He prefers top wire pads such as this one. The paper is a good thickness and doesn't bleed through when using markers. It erases well and doesn't rip or tear when erasing. It's a good size for his drawing. These are comparable to sketch pads that I have purchased at the art supply store.,1
dramatic,Good board book for toddlers. This is a good size board book  harder for little hands to hold but recommended for 3 year olds or so. I was actually surprised that is was as large as it is. Its dramatic though and its an amazing story about the tale of the candy cane. Talks about Jesus and the reason for the season. Very well written  the artwork is beautiful.,1
cute designs,Cute & Absorbent!. These diapers are not only cute  but absorbent  too! I love the little otter designs! The wetness indicator works well. There's a yellow stripe in the center of the diaper and when wet  it changes to blue. The stripe is along most of the length so it doesn't matter if it's worn by a boy or girl. The Velcro tabs are strong and stay in place well. The legs are gathered to help prevent leakage. I'm glad to see the that no chlorine bleach was used in the manufacturing process.,1
not good quality,The price says it all. Not good quality. It’s only meh. It is very thin material in some spots that made me afraid I was just going to break it. At first it seemed like it would be nice but it’s it’s only good to help protect it for now. I will be buying something else. No way it will hold up is it’s dropped like it indicates,0
soulful and beautiful,The Street Was Always There ... and so was Eric Andersen. One of the great unsung heroes of the American folk  folk-rock  singer/songwriter scenes of the '60s and '70s.  Eric Andersen never reached the level of popular success he so truly deserved  but he's just kept on plugging along  year after year  decade after decade  album after album  label after label.  The Street Was Always There is a fine example of his later recorded work.  His voice is deeper  and a bit worn around the edges  yet as soulful and beautiful as ever.  This covers collection may not be classic Andersen  but it is a solid journeyman's effort.  Much like Andersen himself.  Three-and-one-half stars from this longtime fan.,1
classic disney musical,chitty chitty bang bang. This is a great family fare... classic disney musical... quite wonderful.  A young widower  raising 2 young children and a grandpa.  Money is tight... Daddy is a wannabe inventor and struggles.  In typical disney-like (NOT DISNEY) fare - comedy  music  great story and fun.  Even though I watched this movie as very young child  my 5 year old grandson finds it just as fun as I did and still do.  We sing along.  Worth owning in my opinion.,1
a little small,A little small but great quality. Very cute  top fits a bit small and short are kinda a low rise fit... but I love it anyway! Great fabric  well made,1
a lot of product,Fun w resin crafts!. Seriously. I bought these bc they popped upon sale while I was looking at resin or resin molds. I had no earthly idea what it was even for! Lol.

apricot scent,Smells strongly of apricot not orange. I've liked all of the Everyone Soap varieties I've tried - until this one.  I expected a bright orange scent  but instead what I smell the most is apricot.  Not a peachy fresh apricot  but an overly ripe  brown  withering  fallen-off-the-tree  basking in the hot sun sort of apricot.  The base formulation is great just like the other EO soaps  but the smell just isn't right to me.  Maybe mine was from a bad batch.,0
learn almost nothing about any of the new kids,yuck. I read this on my kindle. The story is nothing like it should have been. No one was how you remember them. Key characters such as Hagrid are barely even mentioned. We learn almost nothing about any of the new kids except Albus. Don't ruin your Harry Potter memories by reading this book.,0
smaller mugs,larger stainless pitcher. I actually purchased this to pour one cup of water into my individual cup coffee maker.  So I don't froth milk.. but this pitcher is good for my larger mugs - the other one is smaller mugs - I actually purchased the smaller one first  by accident...Using this pitcher is just easier than guessing how much to pour in.  Overflowing your brewed coffee is such a mess.  They wash in the dishwasher easily - just like your stainless steel utensils.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,0
hard pointy items can poke through,These bags are a decent thickness.  They add both sides together to get the 9.5 mil. Don't think the bag side is 9.5 mil thick.  It's a total of both sides when laying flat.  The bags are still of good quality.  They are a decent value at approximately 33 cents each.  I would buy these again.  Be careful with hard pointy items such as dehydrated carrots  they can poke through.,0
electronic metronomes,Solid instrument that can help with not only time  but dynamics and listening skills. I received this as a free review sample. Since there are a number of very detailed reviews I am going to stick to how I use it as a drummer.  First  if you are practicing dynamics  this is an excellent tool. Of course it's designed to develop a sense of time  but it produces a beat in the 60 dB range at one meter. For a drummer this is somewhere in the P to PP range  so if you combine time keeping exercises with dynamics  this is an invaluable tool that I suspect most drummers will overlook because it's based on a design that is literally hundreds of years old. Trust me  this is effective. Moreover  since it is not incredibly loud it reinforces listening skills. I used this for a solid week in my practice room before writing this review and can make the claim that if you are a trained drummer this metronome has the potential to improve your dynamics  listening and time.  A nice thing is this is not as delicate as the old style metronomes upon which the design is based. It's not a toy and does need to be treated with care  but I owned a much older instrument that was temperamental and did not like being moved or handled much. This one is more robust.  Bottom line: if you are uncertain if this will be loud enough  download a copy of [[ASIN:B0054KJND6 Decibel-O-Meter Free]] and measure your own instrument's sound pressure level at one meter and determine if this metronome will be loud enough. For some instruments it may not be  but for many like an acoustic piano  guitar  etc. it will be. For folks like me this works for certain exercises like those I mentioned and it is a lot more pleasant than some of the electronic metronomes I have tried.,0
well made,Great reading glasses!. I work from home and am on the computer easily 9-10 hours a day and my eyes feel the strain. I have prescription reading glasses but they don't work well with computer work. So  instead of buying bifocals  I decided to try an over the counter set of glasses. These are great for the money. They fit perfectly  are well made and I definitely can feel the reduction of strain on my eyes after using these for over a month now. They look great  too. Highly recommend!,1
flattering pleats at the waist,"Comfy Dress. This dress is so comfortable that it feels like wearing your favorite t-shirt. It's soft and has a hint of stretch. There are flattering pleats at the waist and it even has pockets. If you're a larger cup size  the top may be slightly sheer. I found the fit to be true to size. I sized down for a more fitted look. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the small.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
over priced,Not bad  prefer Tums. I rated this as 3 stars. Taste was good  not crazy about the consistency. Maybe I am just used to the consistency (chalky) of Tums. These seemed a little chewier  These are also way over priced for what I consider almost a no-name brand. I would prefer to get the generic at CVS for a lot less.,0
old sound track,Pink Floyd.....ahhh. We have the old sound track of Dark Side of the Moon.  My husband know music and is in fact a composer in his own right.  He listened to this trice so far and put his stamp of approval on it.  It always was an excellent recording but this new one is wonderful  you can hear things you do not hear on the original.,1
just ordered another bottle,Great gummies to help build tiny immune systems!. I saw these during the current pandemic and thought they would be great for my two gransons to take to help build up their immune systems. I wasn't sure how they would like them and I was pleasantly surprised that they actually liked them! I have been giving these to them daily for two weeks now and have just ordered another bottle. I find it funny that they actually remind me when they need to take them  lol. I think anything that's good for them and also fun for them to take is a win-win. I highly recommend.,1
great for training,Love this training leash!. this training leash is well made and durable.  I love the latch.  You have to turn and hold the cylinder section to be able to unclip the carabiner clip.  It's well made and has a rubber on the inside of the loop to make it easier on the wrist.  This is great for training or if you just want to keep your dog close to your side.,1

hang on the drive stick,"car garbage can and kleenex dispenser. The garbage can is small - but wider than I had hoped.  I had wanted to set this can in the side door slot.. but it's too wide. (2019 Lexus 450hL).  So  the only choice I have is to ""hang"" the garbage can on the drive stick and drape to the passenger side... OR set - loose- on the passenger side floor.  Eh.  It MIGHT be leather - can't really tell.  The tissue holder is really a tosser - I can't use it and the tissue included is really awful quality.  So - I am still looking for what I really want.  This isn't it.",0
She really likes it,added to collection. Celine is one of my wife's favorite singers. I purchased this for her for Christmas and added it to her iTunes playlist. She really likes it. in fact two songs were added to her 1/2 marathon training playlist.,1
clafoutis,Sugar and spice and everything nice!. Samantha Seneviratne’s “The New Sugar and Spice” takes classic comfort bakes like cinnamon rolls  cookies  breads and cheesecake and reinvents them  using seductive hits of spice in creative and crowd-pleasing ways. In the introduction  the author points out that “the flood of sugar has diluted real flavor  muffled complexity  and concealed true richness ” so her goal was to create delicious  healthier desserts that use spices in a starring role in place of the overwhelming sweetness so prevalent in many desserts.  Chapters are divided by spices (sometimes with complementary pairings)  including peppercorn and chile  cinnamon  nutmeg  clove and cardamom  ginger  and savory herbs and spices. Along the way  Samantha includes stories about her family’s roots and how her Sri Lankan heritage influenced her culinary style  along with fascinating historical insights and storage tips on the various featured spices.  Cinnamon  hazelnut and date buns  ricotta cheesecake with bourbon-raisin jam  orange and honey baklava  orange-clove pull-apart bread  and saffron currant braid were all recipes that instantly called my name. Several years ago  I became hooked on Scandinavian baking and now tend to use cardamom liberally in yeast rolls and sweet breads (even in my morning coffee)  so naturally I was thrilled to see a whole chapter starring my favorite spice!  Measurements are given in both volume and weight (which I appreciate as I find weight measurements to be more reliable). Samantha’s guidance is spot-on there are helpful hints both for new bakers as well as experienced ones to guarantee the best results  particularly for recipes involving yeast. Gorgeous photography by Erin Kunkel highlights various ingredients and finished bakes for maximum (mouth-watering!) impact.  In addition to familiar treats  you’ll find updated versions of international classics such as profiteroles  clafoutis and tarte tatin  Scandinavian bakes like saffron currant braids and cardamom-laced shortbread  Thai banana fritters  Indonesian kue lapis  Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars that are perfect for fall  and other fragrant  delightful baked goods that spiced up my rather predictable baking repertoire. As an experienced home baker  I appreciated the challenge and loved the complexity that the various spices gave to my baked goods and will certainly be baking my way through “The New Sugar and Spice in the near future!  (I received my copy through Blogging for Books),1
works well with sleeveless summer a line dresses,Pretty  great spring/summer sweater.. I like light sweaters in the summer.  This is perfect  nice drape  will work well with some of my sleeveless summer a line dresses. Slimming  with a just a bit of a flair at the hips which I like.  I’m a size 8  ordered medium  fits well.,1
snacks,WHAT THEY EAT OUTSIDE THE USA. Interesting to try their snacks but certainly nothing to write home about.  If price cut in half the value would get one more star.  If you do not mind spending the bucks and wonder what people in other countries eat then go for it.  Looking for great treats inexpensively - skip this.  I suspect sooner or later one country will come up with something that your taste buds will fall in love with but otherwise just enjoy the experience and don't have too many expectations.,0
great,Super sticky. This tape is great. I've used it several times now but it is easy to remove if you need to.,1
pay for all my stuff,sparkle lens covers with 'crystals' on rim. Samsung watch 4  40mm  frame covers.  I love sparkle  however  these are really rough and snag things - thus I removed it and tossed.  I wish the 'sparkle' crystal edge had been better polished and/or set in so they would not be so scratchy.  Eh.   Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes. Bottom line  I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,1
Pro Controller,Not bad!. So I got this with the intent to play Super Mario Odyssey. I received this and the official Pro Controller around the same time and  while I much prefer playing with the Pro Controller because of many reasons  I still use this one for other games besides Odyssey.  The feel of this one is a bit on the light side. It's hollow  though I suspect that's for any lack of vibration. The buttons are nice and clicky  more so than the ones on the Pro Controller  and I actually prefer the buttons on this one. However  because of the slightly wider (larger?) size  the shoulder buttons may be slightly more difficult to reach than the Pro Controller. The thumbsticks are longer  which I do not like for platformers and racing games. They may be good for FPS games  but I find there are far more genres of games on the Switch than FPS.  The back buttons are a nice addition  though I hardly ever use them. I've programmed them to duplicate L and R and thought I'd use them more often  but I don't. They work well enough and are positioned so as not to be in the way of accidental presses  but are within reach if necessary.  The texture is a nice matte feel  so no sweaty palms.  Overall  a great controller if you're looking for one on the budget.,0
difficult to slide the seat into place,Easy to assemble  Bike rides smooth  display and fan not so good.. It is a little difficult to slide the seat into place but I think it's only because it's new. The display panel is too small and it's difficult to see it due to no back lighting. The fan is absolutely useless. Even when I lean into the fan  it doesn't blow my hair at all.  It's too high on the display and too weak.  The plug for the display is in the front of the bike  making it a trip hazard unless you want to face the wall while working out.  I had to tape mine to the bottom of the bike.  They should have passed the wire through the frame of the bike so that it could plug into the back.  The bike itself rides smoothly and is very quiet.  It would be nice to have the bells and whistles actually work correctly.,0
comfortable place for her to sit,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
crafting sprinkled in every few pages,"Retro-inspired country Christmas is a walk down memory lane.... ""The Farm Chicks Christmas"" by Serena Thompson is the follow-up to 2009's [[ASIN:1588168662 The Farm Chicks in the Kitchen: Live Well  Laugh Often  Cook Much]]. The first Farm Chicks book was a countrified cookbook peppered liberally with stories and reminiscences by Serena and Teri  antiques-inspired craft ideas (a reusable stencil was included in the front)  and comfort food: easy recipes for breakfast treats  appetizers  soups and salads  and decadent desserts  over fifty in all.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas "" on the other hand  is written only by Serena  a contributing editor for Country Living magazine and antiques show hostess (her best friend Teri has retired from their business). The book still includes numerous country-inspired craft ideas you'll find decorative  retro-inspired self-adhesive gift tags and notecards at the back  along with various decorating ideas for ""the most wonderful time of the year."" However  the ratio of crafts to recipes is reversed from the first book there are only 17 recipes included at the back with gift-giving suggestions on how to package them.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" captures the magic of childhood Christmases  from family visits to the tree farm (complete with recipe ideas for hot drinks to tote along)  holiday decorating ideas (holiday scalloped bunting  vintage-inspired snowball pompom ornaments  cone trees and vintage funnel trees  banners and more)  and photos of Serena's friends' and family's homes decorated for Christmas.  Much of the book is more like a scrapbooked photo essay  with crafts sprinkled in every few pages. Also  the decorating tips (and included photos) are vintage country in the Farm Chicks fashion: displaying old farm toys standing in coconut snow  for example  or stacking metal funnels to make ""trees."" If you're not a fan of all things country  this probably isn't the holiday book for you.  The included holiday recipes are few  and aimed mostly at gift-giving  like the sweet and salty nuts  mini orange bundt cakes  and various types of cookies (butter cutouts  chocolate-covered peanut butter balls  snowballs  Spritz cookies). As with the previous book  a handy list of metric equivalent charts is provided at the back. I tried the sweet and salty nuts recipe first  and though tasty  I didn't think that the ""sweet"" flavor predominated it was more of a subtle afterthought (there's only 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of honey for 3 cups of nuts).  Overall  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" is a nostalgic walk down a snowy memory lane  but it has narrower mass appeal than ""Farm Chicks in the Kitchen"" due to the reversal of the recipe-to-crafts ratio and the genre-specific decorating style (I enjoyed the many beautiful photographs  but won't find myself making yarn-ball wreaths or filling jars with spare Christmas lightbulbs anytime soon).

signed it and off it went within minutes,$50.00 gift card. I ordered this for a friend.  I needed to mail it across the country. I really did receive it the next day! It was in an envelope and I removed that and the gift card was in a card and envelope. I signed it and off it went within minutes. My kind of shopping!,1
Anastasia Moutsatsou,"Putumayo Presents: Greece - A Musical Odyssey. Putumayo's Greece-A Musical Odyssey was released in 2004 to coincide with the Athens Olympics  and features an ear-opening blend of traditional Greek styles such as rembetika (known as Greek ""blues"" and usually about misfortunes) and entehno from artists such as George Dalaras  Glykeria  Apenanti  Melina Kana  Anastasia Moutsatsou  Kostas Mantzios  and Theodosia Stiga.  The magical bouzouki (a steel-stringed long-necked lute) is featured on every track  along with the santouri (a type of dulcimer). There are Balkan flourishes and even a hint of flamenco on Ragizi Apopse. Many of the songs are melancholy-sounding ballads balanced out by more intense songs such as Pino Pino.  Putumayo has included excellent liner notes as usual  with detailed biographies (with an artist pronunciation guide!)  photos  a Greek music glossary  and even a recipe for Tzatziki  Greek cucumber-yogurt sauce.  I had not been exposed to Greek music before watching My Big Fat Greek Wedding and picking up Greece: A Musical Odyssey  but I fell in love with rembetica and the bittersweet songs  and have since expanded my Greek music collection. If you enjoy spirited folk music (or if you really liked the music from [[ASIN:B00006AAUC My Big Fat Greek Wedding]])  you'd do well to buy Greece: A Musical Odyssey.",1

lightweight,white corelle serving bowls. These are just as you would expect... tough... durable.. simple.  I purchased to compliment my corelle set.  I like them because they are so durable  and yet lightweight.  The older I get  the better that is for me.  The bowls are what I would consider large.,1
suspense and passion,Captivating Beaty and the beast nod. The suspense and passion of this book makes it fast paced and easy to read. Each character has depth and development from the author which makes you look toward the ending. Once the ending arroyos then long for the next book. I highly recommend to HEA enthusiasts!,1
Great quality,A little small but great quality. Very cute  top fits a bit small and short are kinda a low rise fit... but I love it anyway! Great fabric  well made,1

delicious popcorn,DELICIOUS POPCORN. My sister-in-law introduced me to this popcorn last year and it is delicious!  I really wish she hadn't because it is addictive!,1
disappointing droppers,"Bottles are gorgeous but eyedropper suction/release is awful. There are six porcelain bottles with eyedropper tops  two plastic ""syringes"" and a plastic funnel. These bottles are just gorgeous. I also like that they are opaque to protect the contents that one puts inside from light.  These have many uses such as to store a mix of essential oils that were combined into a blend. Unfortunately  the dropper tops are awful. The tops only have enough suction power to pick up about one 1/5th of a dropper's worth of product and it does not release it well.  This is very disappointing. If the droppers worked fully  I would have rated this 5 stars.",0
works just as it should,4k adapter cable. Husband needed for his head phone charger - works just as it should.  I will update my review with any updates should new info seem useful.,1
cakes,Make showstopping desserts on your countertop with minimal effort!. I’m a fairly recent convert to the slow cooker bandwagon I only purchased my first slow cooker a couple of years ago and started out by baking my way through all the desserts in Michele Scicolone’s excellent “The Mediterranean Slow Cooker ” which introduced me to the joys of making flan  cheesecake  and fruit compote in the slow cooker.  Fast forward several years later and I was looking to expand my slow cooker desserts repertoire  so imagine my delight when I got an e-mail from Lisa Ekus that highlighted “Slow Cooker Desserts” by Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore! Roxanne and Kathy are cookbook authors  food consultants  cooking teachers and food bloggers who have written seven cookbooks and a popular blog  www.pluggedintocooking.com.  As soon as my copy of “Slow Cooker Desserts” arrived  I couldn’t wait to dig in to the many inviting recipes covering not only cakes and cheesecakes  but also bread puddings  fruits  and candy and fondues. The book opens with a good compact guide to slow cookers  bakeware  and ingredients. The layout is uncluttered and straightforward  and each recipe is followed by helpful tips  making it perfect for novice bakers. The gorgeous photography by Jennifer Davick deserves a special mention as well.  The first recipe I tried was the Praline-Pumpkin Cheesecake. I decided to substitute a gingersnap crust for the graham crackers  and it added the perfect touch of spice to complement the spices in the cheesecake filling. Note that you do need to blind bake the gingersnap crust prior to baking in the slow cooker  but this only adds a few minutes to the prep time. Also  perhaps it was the brand of gingersnaps I used  but I would recommend adding a little extra melted butter until the crust comes together – the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter for ½ cup crumbs. One thing I would suggest is to also liberally spray the sides of your springform pan as well – mine is supposedly nonstick  but I followed the recipe (which only specifies to spray the bottom of the pan) and a large portion of my cheesecake edges stuck and broke. I normally do spray the entire pan with Baker’s Joy  but I follow the recipes as written when I am testing for reviews.  The finished cheesecake texture is very fluffy and a bit crumbly  so I did have difficulty cutting it neatly I’m not sure if I may have beat TOO much air into my filling and will beat for less next time. The praline topping (made in the microwave in under three minutes) is destined to become my new secret weapon in the kitchen! This homemade caramel was delicious and deceptively easy and would also make a great addition to ice cream or cakes. All combined (gingersnap crust  spiced pumpkin filling  praline topping)  this is a great fall dessert with minimal effort and also frees up your oven for other baking tasks.  The second recipe I tried was the candied cranberry and crystallized ginger chutney this one called my name because I am a certified fiend when it comes to candied ginger. I had a bag of organic cranberries in the freezer that I was looking to use up  so it worked out perfectly that I already had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry (even the ginger liqueur!). My bag of organic cranberries was slightly smaller than the 16-oz. bag called for in the recipe  so I scaled back on the sugar quite a bit as I was using candied ginger (I used ¾ cup sugar in place of the 1 ¼ in the recipe  and it was plenty sweet for me). It also had the bonus of making my kitchen smell amazing as it cooked! I cooked mine down for a little longer the recipe says that it should be thin  but I like my chutney on the very thick side more like a compote. The recipe calls for between 5 to 7 hours on low and I ended up cooking mine for 3 hours on high due to time. This would be fantastic stirred into yogurt  as an accompaniment to Indian food  or even as a side dish in place of jellied cranberries or cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.  The third recipe was the chocolate cashew clusters. I’d seen slow cooker candy (including nut clusters) pop up in my Facebook feed  but I’d never tried making it before. The recipe uses salted cashews  semisweet and milk chocolate chips  a dark chocolate candy bar  and candy coating to create decadent nut clusters that look like they came from a candy shop. These take about 1 ½ hours on low plus cooling / set time (3 to 5 hours).  Other recipes on my to-make list from “Slow Cooker Desserts” include the cinnamon-calvados applesauce  rice pudding with cherries  and many of the cheesecakes (brownie chunk  German chocolate  ginger-peach  coconut cream) and cakes (cider-glazed apple-walnut cake  Southern sweet potato cake  pineapple butter cake). There is enough variety and possible variations (I need to find a way to make a cookie butter cheesecake!) to keep you happily baking for months to come.  (Thank you to Lisa Ekus for the review copy!),1
Song by the original stars,From Sea to Shining Sea. Great music. Song by the original stars. Gets you in the patriotic mood so needed in these troubling times for the USA,1
feeding them every week to 10 days,Great for your plants.. I love this product and it is $2.00 cheaper than Lowes and $1.00 cheaper than Walmart. I will order 3 next time  since I am a flower person. All my plants do great from feeding them every week to 10 days. In Florida I use it on my flowering trees even my Avocado tree  who has lots of fruit. The tree is so beautiful with large leaves  even I do not like avocadoes.,1
conclusion,real or memorex. You think you know what you're watching is real but are you sure. I felt engaged all the way through. a few times I thought I was figuring it all out. but as this started coming to a conclusion... not so much. the end leaves you thinking I like that...  when you watch it again you know what's coming but I picked up on things I missed earlier. it helped but I still felt in the end a bit off  not sure if it was real or ....  it will be interesting to wait a few years and watch this again and see how it seems. we don't do movie channels  hbo  showtime etc  we pull out our videos and watch them instead.,0
Didn’t come with bulbs,Good price. Great. Looks beautiful on house. Didn’t come with bulbs. Puts off a pretty shine of light.,0
saving me a lot of money,Delicious coffee and saves me lots of money a day because I don’t buy Starbucks and others anymore. I love these coffees because I don’t need to shop at Starbucks every morning or other expensive coffee so it’s saving me a lot of money . They are delicious,1
build up my system with minerals in my water,"Great For Rehydrating Especially  After Bout Of ""The Runs"". I have been trying to build up my system with minerals in my water  but not too long ago  I had a bout with the runs- the kind that leave you feeling rather exhausted after a day of running to the bathroom.  I noticed that I was feeling very ill and weak the next day or two  then it dawned on me.  I thought I would try this..  WHAT IS THIS LIKE? This stuff is thickened in a bottle which has a twist of raspberry flavoring added.  It is not sweet  just has a raspberry essence.  There is no sweetener  and the dropper has measuring lines on it.  HOW TO USE THIS? I was so run down when I got thinking about it  I remembered- you can easily get dehydrated when having ""the runs"".  I immediately got out this electrolyte mixture and put a small amount of this (like.25) into a very large glass of water.  I drank it down as gradually as I could and then through the day I added more water.  By the end of the morning  I was feeling TONS better.  This really did help me rehydrate and feel better after being wiped out.  THE BOTTOM LINE This is not hard to take  has just a bit of raspberry flavor  but does help me to rehydrate when I really need help.  I experienced relief greatly after having a bout with ""the runs""  I plan to use a little bit now and then to continue to rehydrate this winter.  MY RATING FOUR STARS.  I love that this helped me through a rough patch when I needed hydration.  I am torn between five and four stars for review.  I am VERY glad there is not heavy sweetener in this like so many things have.  I also am kind of unclear on ingredients or this company.  I also experienced good from it so far  so I am leaving it at FOUR STARS  but REALLY IT IS FOUR AND A HALF.",1
gift for my brother,Good game. Bought this as a gift for my brother and he loves it.,1
telephone number,Crazy Twitter. I assume it is great  but Twitter tells me my phone number is used by some one else  I gave them my house phone. HELLO  stupid Twitter tells me they mailed me password  really on a land line phone? Smart Twitter acting stupid. I have my telephone number forever on my Amazon account and smart phone. I do not know how I can get on Twitter. Maybe someone can give me advice for my smart phone  I sure not smart enough to tell Twitter or know how to contact them.,0
I love these,Earrings. Light weight  beautiful color  I love these,1
use on someone else,Better to use on a partner than to use on yourself. I have owned several massage guns over the years to assist me with the neck and shoulder pain I have had over the years. I saw this one and wanted to try it. It is super powerful but is not the easiest to maneuver on my own (it was much easier to use on someone else than on myself).  I had a lot of difficulty holding it steady while trying to apply to my shoulder. I did try to use it on my calves and it was much better there. So  bottom line  not good for yourself if you are trying to reach areas that are not convenient (back of the neck  shoulders) but it is great for you to use on others. Just a little difficult to control.,1
slimming,Pretty  great spring/summer sweater.. I like light sweaters in the summer.  This is perfect  nice drape  will work well with some of my sleeveless summer a line dresses. Slimming  with a just a bit of a flair at the hips which I like.  I’m a size 8  ordered medium  fits well.,1

There are a TON of free downloads. Games and shows. Charges fast and battery lasts a while. My daughter was so happy and loves it. Highly recommend,1
pretty,Reusable christmas boxes. These are flatter reusable christmas boxes with magnetic flaps.  They are sturdy and pretty.  We reuse them for years - these look like they will last - but time will tell!  We use wired ribbon and reuse it too.   Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - nearly 6 000 reviews posted  viewed over 50 000 times  and over 24 000 likes.

Bertie's fans,Transports You Away to a Caribbean Island. This is my first Bertie Higgins album  so I can't compare it to his others.  Until this album I only knew him from his mega-hit Key Largo.  It's a great song  but played so much on the radio that I almost got sick of it.  Unfortunately not many of his other songs got as much radio play and that's a shame.  Bertie has a rich clear voice and lot of great songs that transport you away to the islands or to south Florida.  Comparisons to Jimmy Buffet are probably inevitable  since they both seem to sing about layed-back liesure or island living.  Jimmy's fans are known as parrotheads and Bertie's are boneheads.  You might think he copied Buffet and just changed a few things.  Perhaps he did to some extent (Buffet was one of his inspirations)  but I think that Higgins is a much better singer than Buffet  as much as I like Jimmy Buffet.  Sure  the pirate theme seems something contrived and gimmicky and perhaps gets a little silly at times  but it doesn't detract from the fine quality of the songs.  There are a lot of songs here it's a good collection of Bertie's best  I think.  One of the traps that a themed based singer can fall into is having all his songs sound alike.  Each of Bertie's songs sound different.  He also doesn't have one those voices where every song sounds the same  which you find more so with Buffet and various other singers.  There is enough variety in his delivery and the sound of his voice to make this interesting and enjoyable not the same song over and over again.  The themes of most of the songs may be the same  but the variety is still there and that's quite a difficult thing to achieve.,1
fake bully sticks,Too expensive not long lasting too few items. Not worth the $. Some chews were hollow fake bully sticks.  4 packages with max 4 in each bag.  Fake bully sticks 3 thin real bully’s couple of ears and a couple thin curly things Will not buy products again Way to expensive!,0
tourti&egravere,A delightful tour of the many gastronomic pleasures Quebec has to offer.... Julian Armstrong has written about food for the Montreal Gazette for more than five decades. As soon as I heard about this book  I knew it was the one for me I studied abroad for two summers in a French immersion program at Universite Laval in Quebec City and majored in French with an emphasis on Quebec Studies  so La Belle Province has a huge place in my heart. Quebec is a huge land area with great diversity in its landscape and people some regions are famous for certain products (the nickname “bleuets ” blueberries  is given to people from the Lac-St-Jean area as they grow large amounts of the fruit). Quebec also produces many excellent raw milk cheeses (which are under strict control in other provinces) and maple syrup. Its culinary heritage is strongly influenced by hearty French cuisine preferred by trappers and fur traders. “Made in Quebec” is the author’s second cookbook focusing on the cuisine of Quebec here she spent several years interviewing cheese makers  mushroom foragers  chefs and farmers  salt cod fishermen  fruit scientists and growers. The book is divided by season and include both staples (poutine  tourti&egravere  tarte au sucre  pate chinois) and modern interpretations of traditional flavours. I loved the simple  delicious vegetarian options like the gorgeous Tarte aux tomates confites au sirop d’&eacuterable et cru du clocher (Tomato Tarts with Maple Syrup) on the cover in addition to many lamb and pork dishes  there are many fish- and veggie-based dishes to enjoy. The desserts in particular are spectacular.,1
good plot,Liked it a lot. Samantha  a nurse is kidnapped by an FBI agent on the run with a young boy. She ends up going on the run with them and helps him to discover who wanted them dead. A lot of suspense  a good plot and decently written. A few misspelled words and bouncing between POV's without warning was confusing. Also  too many scenes were neatly explained away and too many simple daily functions were never included which took away the believability of the story. Aside from that I adored the family dynamic and the happily ever after.,1

The head of the owl is suppose to be diamonds and in the feathers on the bottom. The cover fits perfectly on my phone!,1
fulfilled by 365 cycles,Not for me.. Seat was immediately uncomfortable.  I had to return.  PS if any of the parts are fulfilled by 365 cycles  even if it is a bike saddle  plan on not getting a full refund.  How does one see if they like the saddle if they don't take it out of the box and install on the bike?,0

top 50 reviewer,The chronicles of Narnia: prince of caspian. Great story and good for kids over age 7 in my opinion.  My 7 year old grandson is really into the series.

paraben and sulfate free,Just as good as the named brands at a reduced cost!. I get keratin treatments for my hair probably 3 times a year. As such  I always have to use shampoos and conditioners that are sulfate free. Typically  most of the products I use are expensive  so I was looking for an alternative. I absolutely love this Amazon Brand product. Just as good as using a  more expensive salon brand  this shampoo leaves my hair soft and smooth and because its paraben and sulfate free  I  can keep it that way at much less cost. Kudos Amazon for creating another great generic product which is just as great as the named brand products. Oh  and I love the fragrance of this Argan Oil  too!,1
fresh,Loved by all. These came and were very fresh and everyone in the house ate them. Did not even last a day. they were very good.,1
lip products,Try Sephora's box for skincare  Ipsy for makeup  and Allure's for the recycling bin. I haven't yet figured out why Allure has such a hard time with a beauty box. Every four to six months  it's like they fired all the bad box people  put someone in who wants to please customers  and you get a great box. But a month or so later  you're back to small  crappy samples and the ever-present awful customer service.  This isn't worth $15. If you like the lower end prices of beauty boxes  I highly recommend Sephora (lots of great skin care  excellent sizes  and decent sized makeup  i.e. lip products.) If you don't mind discovering new brands (that means brands you never heard of  and that can be either good or bad)  especially makeup  I suggest you give Ipsy a try. Definitely more makeup-heavy than Sephora. Each of these subscriptions if $10 and they are WAY worth more almost every Allure box I've gotten.  Addendum: I've since tried Boxycharm  which features full-sized products from brands they actually sell at Sephora and Ulta. Mostly makeup  but also high quality skincare  and at $21 inc. shipping  it is THE best beauty box value on the market.,1

sun and wind off of baby,I love this! It's lightweight so baby doesn't get too .... I love this!  It's lightweight so baby doesn't get too hot  but it also keep the sun and wind off of baby.  It also helps keep people from touching the baby.  Too many germs around these days!,1
melancholic,Different. I'm a bit disappointed with this one. Every other Florence + the Machine album is an instant 10 in my book. This one  although not bad by any means  just doesn't quite do it for me. A little melancholic. A little too ho-hum. A little too ballad-y. Again  I LOVE FLORENCE...just not this Florence.,0
batteries are required,Hours of Fun!. This V-Tech Marble Rush Ultimate Set provides hours of fun! Younger kids may need some help setting it up  but many kids will be able to do it on their own. Set up does take a little bit of time  but the pieces fit well together and it's not frustrating. Batteries are required. It comes with batteries for demo purposes  but it's recommended that they are replaced. We've been playing with it for a several days now without any problems on the original batteries. Suggested age for this is 4+. I think there is a wide spread of ages that would enjoy this.,0
"<span class=""neg"">designed for young girls or ballerinas</span>",Simple headbands that loosely grip my headwish there were more color variety. There are 12 headbands in this set and practically all of them look a similar shade of pastel pink  purple  and yellow. Only one headband is bold with an emerald green. I would have liked a red  black  and brown in this set. However  this appears to be designed for young girls or ballerinas who would love these colors.  I tried these on and the headbands are comfortable and do not squeeze my head. They also stay put. I have a small head so these would probably feed a youngster just fine.  The current price of $15.99 comes to a reasonable $1.33 per headband.,0
anyone who loves Minecraft,Minecraft UNO cards fun gift to give. I bought these Minecraft UNO cards for my Nephew. He loved them. We played 3 games right away. The artwork is great. You should get these cards for anyone who loves Minecraft.,1
white color is too cool and dim,Decent lightbulb.. Some colors appear off - you can see two colors around the edge of my lamp. It's a little disorienting. The white color is too cool and dim for my tastes. However I like that I can use this as a red bulb at night (blue light keeps you awake) and use other colors during the day.,0
awesome idea,Cashback for every loadup will make this v attractive. Its an awesome idea if Amazon can look into a permanent 5-10% cashback for loyal reload every time.,1
delicate,Nice. these are very beautiful beads for jewelry making. Thin and lightweight but thats what makes them delicate.,0
St Paddy's music,good. Needed St Paddy's music. Price was right  plus with all our other celtic music this didn't have any overlaps in songs. can't beat that. we're ready for our Scottish days next.,1
not the most powerful tools Dewalt offers,Dewalt Max Lithium-Ion 4 tool set. My husband is a project manager.  Uses Dewalt tools every day and for many  many years.  While this kit is NOT the most powerful tools Dewalt offers  he says that they are perfectly fine for home use.  Further he believes that the tool bag is worth it's weight in gold.  It keeps tools readily available and is handy to use in carrying the tools to your project area.  I have to admit most of the men I've seen looking over the tools are ooing and ahing over the actual tool bag.  We purchased this on &#34Prime Sale Day&#34 and my husband believes that we paid a fair sale price.  While it wasn't a &#34steal&#34 it was well worth the money spent.  Everything listed was included... and interestingly the piece that my husband thought he would not use much has turned out to be the most used at this time - the flashlight!  The tools are fairly heavy pieces so I am not sure I will be used them as a girl (ha) but they are certainly doable.  I always update my reviews if new info would be helpful.  Finally  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.,1
fun,Sturdy. I always loved the game of monopoly I knew I would like this Puzzle. For me it was a bit of a challenge... But I did finish it. It was fun . The pc are easy to hold and the puzzle stays together well.,1
hard to fill with air,This is horrible. 0 stars if I could give 0. It was hard to fill with air  no matter how much we flopped it around.  We finally used a heavy duty blower to fill it up.  After filling it up  we laid on it and the air started seeping right out.  Couldn't lay on it for more than 5 minutes.  I do not recommend.,0

"Celtic and New Age done well on BMG's ""Celtic Circle"" releases","5 stars alone for including Brian Kennedy's magnificent ""Carrickfergus""!!. I am an all-out Brian Kennedy fanatic. Brian who  you ask? Brian Kennedy  Belfast-born singer with a voice of spun gold  was Van Morrison's back up singer for several years  recorded the *original* You Raise Me Up (NOT Josh Groban)  starred in hundreds of Riverdance on Broadway shows  and for all of that  he's unheard-of in the US. Celtic Circle 2 includes Brian's soul-wrenching rendition of ""Carrickfergus "" a beautiful song of lament  accompanied only by Brian's less-is-more acoustic guitar. Haunting.  Besides the wonderful gift of Brian Kennedy  Celtic Circle 2 builds on the solid combination of modern Celtic music and Irish-influenced New Age that was so successful on Vol. 1. This time around  we have two discs of the Chieftains (the timeless ""Love Theme from Barry Lyndon"" and ""The Foggy Dew"" with Sinead O'Connor)  Clannad (Caislean Oir  Newgrange  Almost Seems)  Maire Brennan  Irish-American powerhouse Cherish The Ladies  Aine Minogue  Nightnoise  fabulous Irish bagpiper Davy Spillane  James Galway  and the stellar team of Susan McKeown and Natalie Merchant on ""River."" Sarah McLachlan even makes an early appearance with Celtic-inspired ""Drawn To The Rhythm."" My only lament is that Loreena McKennitt wasn't featured Ms. McKennitt's early works were classical Celtic-influenced melodies set to famous poems  accompanied by harp.  It's a much-welcome breath of fresh air to see Celtic and New Age done so well  as BMG has consistently shown on its ""Celtic Circle"" releases. So many ""Celtic"" releases are in fact substandard New Age treacle with anonymous vocals and synth instruments  but here we have 30 outstanding tracks that capture the lyric  melancholy beauty of the Irish nature  recorded by masters of the trade (the Chieftains have been around for more than three decades!). Yes  there are New Age pieces  too  tracks from Lord of the Rings and Titanic  but there is a much more balanced look at modern Celtic on Celtic Circle 2 than on the first (more Celtic  less New Age).  Perfect music for relaxing to at the end of a long day -- light a few candles  close your eyes  and let the soothing Celtic melodies inspire and refresh your weary spirit.",1
love buying things from Amazon,Very easy to load and love buying things from Amazon!. Did this for the free $10 credit but glad I did because it was very easy to do and I plan on doing it again soon! Easy  convenient  and great feature! Happy Prime Member!,1
music was almost an exact duplicate of the Tarzan soundtrack,"Entertaining adaption of a modern Disney classic. For some odd reason I had a compelling need to play this game after I saw several reviews and trailers online. So I tracked it down and paid more than $... by far  but I certainly got my enjoyment from it. The graphics looked great on my computer  and the video quality of the clips between levels looked as good as a DVD version. The skill level could be changed from easy to hard  and additional challenges were sometimes added the harder the level of difficulty. The music was almost an exact duplicate of the Tarzan soundtrack  featuring instrumental versions of the songs ""Trashing the Camp "" ""Son of Man"" and others. The graphics were amazing  especially the backgrounds and waterfall effects. Some dexterity is needed  but younger children should be able to play this game with some help setting up. I used a computer game pad with joystick and it was very easy to control Tarzan/Terk/Jane. There are bonus levels and cutscenes to collect  and the game has definite replay value  especially if your kids love Tarzan. I still haven't managed to beat it on the Hard level yet  so there are hours of gaming pleasure ahead. And at less than $... it makes a perfect gift.",1
sturdy,Very sturdy and absolutely non. This loaf pan is very well made and absolutely non stick every time!  Love it and exactly what I’ve been wanting for a long time.  A happy in the kitchen customer saying thank you!,1
gorgeous food photography,Fantastic blend of complete menus  seasonality  and international flavors. My friend and James Beard Award-winning cookbook author Meike Peters recently released her latest cookbook “365: A Year of Everyday Cooking and Baking” and graciously sent a copy to me here in Japan  where I eagerly pored over the gorgeous food photography with its tantalizing  jewel-like salads.  Meike’s cooking is very much guided by the seasonal calendar  and in “365”  you’ll find a year’s worth of complete menus (including salads  soups  pasta  sandwiches  vegetables  seafood  meat and sweets) that make the most of seasonal produce  marrying them with a range of international influences including hearty German fare  Middle Eastern  and Mediterranean flavors and inspirations.  With the falling of the leaves and the arrivals of colder weather and flurries  the recipes featuring bright  sunny citrus are a welcome respite. Dishes like Winter Caprese with Blood Orange  Beet and Mozzarella di Bufala  Spaghetti with Ricotta  Orange and Crispy Sage Chocolate and Orange Pannetone  and Sicilian Orange Salad with Olive Oil  Marjoram  and Flaky Sea Salt are sure to stave off winter colds and chase the winter blahs away with the generous amount of vitamin C.  Others like Potato and apple-stuffed cabbage rolls with Walnut Butter and Gruyere  German beef  beet and potato stew  and Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Shallots and Apple  provide stick-to-your-ribs comfort.  The salads are a particular delight  including the rainbow potato salad with radishes  shallot vinaigrette and poached eggs  beet and apple carpaccio with pomegranate  raw asparagus and peach salad with orange blossom water and pecorino  and rainbow potato and cucumber salad with dill-pistachio pesto that will bring a splash of color (and flavor!) to overcast days.  Seasonal ingredients are given light-handed treatments that allow their individual textures and delicate flavors to shine  like fresh strawberries with saffron-vanilla sugar  watermelon caprese with mozzarella di bufala  basil and mint  and squash pasta with orange  maple and sage.  If you are someone who  like me  can never seem to come up with a complete menu  that’s one of the beauties of 365: You can also use the weekly menu planner to come up with a seasonal balanced meal by combining the various options for a given week.  I was absolutely intrigued by the idea of candied cherry tomatoes slow roasted and tossed with olive oil  confectioner’s sugar  and herbs  they dissolve into a silky confit that is the perfect complement for fresh pasta and tiny basil. Plus the leftover oil and tomatoes make a fantastic dipping oil!  Measurements and temperatures are provided in both US / Imperial and metric.  This has become one of my favorite cookbooks of the last several years highly recommended.,1
Loved the music,Music from my memories. Loved the music. Brought back  good child hood memories.,1
Amazon,Easy. Great way to get a gift cards and not half to go to the store. And we love Amazon,1
Turn On Your Love Light,Britain does it again!. What started out as a uniquely American genre  that of blues  soul  and gospel  has somehow managed to become the creative property of Britain ... ever since the decline of classic Motown  Britain has been churning out an amazingly talented bunch of blue-eyed soul singers and blues musicians. One of the more recent additions is James Hunter  who first burst onto the scene under the stage name Howlin' Wilf in the 1980s ([[ASIN:B000HOJNI4 Cry Wilf!]]). His several solo recordings are strongly influenced by R&B  early rock and roll  and soul. His 1994 debut Believe What I Say includes guest performances by Van Morrison (Hunter also appeared on several of Van's albums during the '90s and was part of Morrison's Rhythm & Blues Revue).  Believe What I Say opens with the jivin' Two Can Play  with its sassy staccato sax riffs punctuating this tale of infidelity. Hunter's smooth  sensual update of torch song The Very Thought Of You comes off as more late-night smoky jazz  with a delivery that Ray Charles would be proud of. Turn On Your Love Light features a smokin' duet with Van Morrison.  One of the few covers is Ray Charles' Hallelujah I Love Her So. Compared to Charles' original  which leaned towards Big Band brassy  Hunter's backing saxes sound the same on every track  and I felt the instrumentals lacking punch in the first half  but the bridge (with guitar) redeems the song and gospel feeling creeps in toward the finale.  Out of Sight is a tight soul ditty that pays homage to James Brown with its knockout brass/drum punches. Hear Me Calling has some hand-waving gospel vibes going  complete with call-and-response chorus.  The majority of the songs sound like they could have come off the radio from the mid-'50s to late '60s. They're pleasant enough  but the sameness of the backing detracts from the potential to differentiate between tracks. Hunter's writing chops create songs that feel authentically retro. His singing voice combines elements of Ray Charles and Sam Cooke  and his guitar shows heavy influence from Chuck Berry and legendary blues guitarists such as B.B. King.  Hunter has continued to polish his sound on his subsequent solo releases [[ASIN:B0000259AM Kick It Around]] and [[ASIN:B000E1NX1S People Gonna Talk]]  but it's enjoyable to hear his first solo work after his turn with Howlin' Wilf and the Vee-Jays. He's one of the most authentic of the current crop of blue-eyed soul artists  and really inhabits that long-lost R&B/soul/blues era as if it were only yesterday instead of decades ago.,1
absorb well,These absorb well. These absorb and fit well.  I would compare them to other name brand training pants.  Holds urine well.,1
snug,Beautiful Dresses. I loved these beautifully made dresses.  The gorgeous wedding dress is extremely snug so you'll need to put it on your most skinniest Barbie and even use a tiny pin to keep it velcro'd in back.  I love both dresses so much.  The pink gown is so beautiful.,1
holds up to 50 lbs,Awesome little jeep. Awesome little jeep.  It is a nice quality build.  Pretty easy to put together.  Fits a toddler great!  Easy to maneuver  except for those short turns  haha!  It holds up to 50 lbs so it can last a smaller child for years.  I could have ridden in this until I was in 6th grade  but I was a tiny child. Lots of fun and brings lots of excitement to see their very own brightly colored  pink jeep!  Be sure you have it fully charged before giving it to the child  because they will want to ride it all day!,1
plays it often,great gift. great gift for my mom's old school taste. bought it as a gift and she was excited to receive it  she plays it often,1
wine ratings,"Wine Reviews  News  and More. Wine Spectator is a good wine magazine that seeks to keep the reader informed about new wine products  wine facts and education  and wine events. This magazine is published 17 times per year  so it is available often enough that most wine lovers will have more than their fill of reading material.  Most of the material in Wine Spectator deals with buying wine  and you can expect to find several rating lists in every issue. The editors of the magazine supply the majority of the wine ratings  so when you read that one wine earned 95 points and another only 80  you need to keep in mind that these ratings are from the perspective of people who have sampled hundreds or even thousands of different wines. And with each rating or analysis  there is often contact information  such as the name of the winery or web page  so that you can learn more and/or inquire on making a purchase.  To help shoppers find the wines in each issue  Wine Spectator includes a detachable card that includes the names of the different featured wines. This is a handy addition  because it eliminates the need to copy down names of wine on paper or attempt to memorize the titles. All you do is check off the wines you like on the card and take it with you to your favorite beverage store for easy reference.  Wine Spectator seems to have an obsession with lists and with outlandish proclamations. It is common to find lists like ""World's 100 Greatest Pinot"" or ""The 50 Finest California Reds"". Consumers are attracted to listings  and that is probably why the magazine gave in and made lists a regular part of most issues. And it is common to find extreme statements like ""This is the best Cabernet Sauvignon on the Planet"" or ""Greatest German White Wine Ever"". The publication does this to attract attention and sell more issues  but it could get annoying to some readers.  In spite of these few annoyances  Wine Spectator is still a good magazine. The writers at Wine Spectator are very good  very convincing  and very persuasive. They really know wine  and it comes through in their articles and recommendations. The editors articulate themselves very well and they know just the right way to describe the different brands and styles. It all adds up to a very informative magazine publication on the world of wine.",1
drove her to take his life,No spoilers. Four solid stars for a good plot. Great writing and the characters are believable. The summary is pretty spot on. Mia's father was a serial killer who tortured his daughter which drove her to take his life. Vin who is 18 years her senior falls for her after the customary tug and pull. A lot happens in between but that's the general idea. A worthy read.,1
simple,Charges in a good position. It holds the watch for charging. Simple but does the jog.,1
beautifully photographed dishes,Beautiful cookbook  but aimed more at the novice cook. Naturally I'm familiar with Mary Berry from her role as host on the Great British Bake-Off (I've followed the careers of several of the alumni including Edd Kimber  Ruby Tanoh  and Nadiya Hussein)  but this was the first time I'd had the chance to peruse one of her many cookbooks. A legend in British culinary circles  Mary has published more than 75 cookbooks.  In &#34Cooking with Mary Berry &#34 she presents beautifully photographed dishes that lean towards the basic (pizza tartlets  nachos  hummus)  with a dash of well-known European dishes (coq au vin  chicken cordon bleu  boeuf bourguignon  mushroom stroganoff) and quite a few international influences in the form of Mexican / Tex-Mex (mole  shrimp tacos)  Asian  and even Indian and Middle Eastern (including vegetarian dishes such as falafel).  As Mary states in the introduction  her recipes have to meet three criteria: look good  taste good  and be practical to make. Her step-by-step technique photographs would be tremendously helpful for those new to the kitchen  and the limited number of ingredients make this a perfect cookbook for a student going off to college  for example. More experienced chefs will already know all of these tips and tricks  but it's nice to have a reminder from time to time! Some of the vegetarian dishes and sides appealed to me  although the recipes not surprisingly feature meat and seafood quite heavily. I'm also interested in trying Mary's breads and baked goods as that is what she is primarily known for.  This would make a great gift for a budding chef in your life  or if you have basic cooking skills and are interested in trying more adventurous international dishes.,1
not for cleaning with water and tablets,will work. I ordered 2 of these and it would have been so nice if they'd sent two different colors... but no. Two of the same.  I have a mouth guard AND invisalines for top and bottom.  So I ordered the two.  I don't really care what they look like... I two I got were a muddled white and teal mostly.  They will work.  They are an average/typical size.  Good for storage only  not for cleaning with water and the tablets you can buy.  Just in case you thought you'd might try that.,0
Delicious hot dogs,Delicious hot dogs. Great flavor,1
fast delivery,Five Stars. fast delivery and card worked,1
energizing,Refreshing!. I like wearing eye masks such as these. They are refreshing and energizing. I store them in my small beauty refrigerator which makes them even more enjoyable. After wearing them  I felt ready to take on the world! It comes with a little spatula so you can take them out of the jar without touching them. It felt like they were slipping as I wore them  but when I went to the bathroom to remove them  they were still in place where I left them. One thing I like about this type of eye mask is that it's easy to go about your day while wearing them. I didn't have any issues with sensitivity thankfully. My eyes are super sensitive.,1
ruined a once great game,The ruined a once great game.. This forza is among my most disappointing games of the year. It pales in comparison to last year's forza. They literally included none of the great aspects of the last game.  I returned it within 2 days. Don't waste any money on this game.,0
longevity,QUALITY CONSTRUCTED. Fantastic! Back Pac. Color Is Beautiful. Lots of deep pockets w/ easy access. Bag is really holding up extremely well for the amount of use it gets. I Recommend 5 ***** This Back Pac. Awesome! Well Constructed Strong. Longevity.,1
Helena the ghost,I loved the whole series of Mudbug. I loved the whole series of Mudbug..Helena the ghost keeps this one funny with all the things happening to her as she &quotlearns&quot how to be a ghost.Each book tells you about the life and antics of one main character but it also combines the other ones with the new..the lives all intertwine and thtas what makes this a fun suspenseful and at time sexy read...It gets your heart pumping even just after you have laughted your a - - off lol..Going to read more from this author !!!,1
my grandson was thrilled with this bag when I gave it to him,Best Quality  great price. Well made bag which will only get better the older it gets.  Love it  my grandson was thrilled with this bag when I gave it to him.  people who saw it  believed it cost way more than it did.  great purchase.,1
concentrated,Presto great laundry detergent (use so much less) Essential oils too. I was at first sight kind of disappointed I for some reason thought it was going to be larger bottles. I then realized how concentrated Presto was. I was surprised to find out just how small of amount you needed to use. Presto does awesome cleaning getting the stains out. The fact it use essential oils is even better. The smell is great but I'm more of a fresh linen person. I do recommend it price is awesome because you don't use as much.,1
small and delicate,Cute. This is so cute! Small and delicate! Love it ..,1
the holes do not match,HORRIBLE PRODUCT. This arch is a very bad product. Horrible product! It started out ok  but the holes do not match  once you start to connect the seating part.  I could not get it together. So  now I am stuck with a piece of junk that cannot be put together! I called amazon and told them the problem. I was told to take the unit down and repackage it for return the next day. I am 72 years old with heart problems and I had a hard enough time putting the top part together! Told them to pick it up like it was because I could not take the parts down  they refused! Now  I am stuck with junk  and I paid a lot of money for this junk  on a retirement salary. Please read some of the reviews  I wish I had before making the purchase. The holes do not match and I do not know how to make new holes and I should not have to do that! Beware before you buy this product.!,0
will not hold the extension length,Don’t waste your money.. Every time I go to use it the stick collapses and will not hold the extension length. This product is very frustrating. This is a simple solution that I was hoping the product would resolve but it doesn’t.,0
recognized no formatting,no problems. i purposely bought a samsung card so it would work in my samsung tablet without issues  it popped right in  recognized no formatting  perfect  !!,1
soft and baby powder scent,The scent is not the same as it used to be.  I don't know why they changed it but they did. It's not the same I used to use. Scent went from soft and baby powder to almost kind of rank or weird.  I feel like this is the new Coke ... They changed something that wasn't broken.  I won't launder anything in it except bath towels and bathmats now.  Very disappointed as I thought it would give clothes the soft scent that it always gave my daughter's clothes..  I'm just going to stick with tide free and clear even tho I was hoping for a little soft scented aroma therapy on pillowcases and sheets.,1
pay for all my stuff,touch and hold smooth dual door closer system. Husband purchased these to replace some others that had given up the ghost.  We live on the oceanfront and the salt takes a toll.  These are nice because you can do it with your foot (when install at the base of the door) just tap it and it stays open  tap again and it releases.  Easy Peasy.  He prefers these and says they are easy to install.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes. Bottom line  I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,1
sensitive skin,Organic Aloe spray. I purchased this JUST IN CASE I got sunburned  - but was careful and did not.  So  instead I just sprayed this on as sort of a moisturizer and it was great.  I have sensitive skin and I did not have any reaction to it.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
can be played with 2 or more,fast and fun. So  I've been playing this game since I was about 10... It is a fairly fast moving card game and can be played with 2 or more.  I was disappointed to see that in this version they removed the French!  So  the card have only the English words.... Not a BIG deal  but I was disappointed as we had fun shouting out the French.  It's a draw and discard type game... you are racing to collect &#34miles&#34 and be the first to reach a certain goal.  Another thing that was missing in this version was clear scoring information  like &#34safe trips&#34 (not using 200 mile stones) but I remember enough to apply.  If I were doing this again  I search out the French/English version.,1
nice pretty blue,Love it. It’s flexibility  easy to install  nice pretty blue  I love it,1
keeps your attention until the very end,CARL HIAASEN DOES IT AGAIN!. I've read other books by Carl Hiaasen and have enjoyed every one of them.  He's an excellent story teller and keeps your attention until the very end.,1
manufactured in the US,Amazing customer service and cats are obsessed.. I recommend the “without treats” subscription as you get an extra toy. So far my cats are obsessed with at least one toy from each box we’ve received. The others are still appreciated. They're always based around a cool theme and there is one wand toy included each month. At least a couple are manufactured in the US (maybe handmade?). They seem pretty high-quality overall. I’ve gotten two boxes so far and love that meowbox offers a bimonthly subscription through the website. Meowbox also has amazing customer service.,1
protector is great,Great for kids. Really great quality for price. Nice big screen and the protector is great. It came set up to my amazon account already (I don’t know how they did that). There are a TON of free downloads. Games and shows. Charges fast and battery lasts a while. My daughter was so happy and loves it. Highly recommend,1
last long,Doesn’t last long. I have found other product that last longer with less splash,0
check with your doctor first,Superior Labs D Mannose. After mistakenly purchasing D-Mannose with all kinds of additives or other supplements I didn't want or need - until I found this brand  Superior Labs.  Only D-Mannose.  I use it as a preventive and a rescue med in treating uncomplicated UTI's - but I am NOT a doctor.  And if you take a supplement  you should always check with your doctor first - so you don't have any possible issues with other medications or supplements you may take.  I just appreciate these because they are D-Mannose - and just that.   Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

pain to have to hold the box in your hand,Animal Crossing Vibe. This cat island puzzle has an Animal Crossing vibe to it. The image is fun and colorful  plus it has lots of cats! The pieces are a good size and cut well. I didn't notice any puzzle dust. I did not care for the company logo being on the back of every piece. That actually made it a little more difficult to sort because you had to look at both sides to make sure you were putting the right side up. It doesn't come with a poster of the image either. I really appreciate that addition to puzzles. It's a pain to have to hold the box in your hand just so you can see where things go. The full image is on the bottom of the box. The lid has a blown up picture that doesn't show everything. Plus  the brand logo is on both of the images. They really are pushing their logo on us!! They do include a business card size picture of the puzzle but that's really impossible to use because it's so small.,0
good and fun read,Very fast and fun read. I was given this book for free  and my review is voluntary. This is the first book that I have read from this author. I have fallen in love with this series! It is well written. The lead female character ( July) is fast thinking and fun. The casino resort security head is sexy ...and single until he meets July and in a very dangerous situation. Even tho this is a novella that takes place in just one night  it has so much fast action in it. As you read it you can feel the excitement in the story. Good and fun read that I would highly recommend to everyone. Can't wait to read more of this series,1
more bass,Good purchase.... Not unhappy with this purchase at all...... Needs more bass but otherwise a great purchase.,0
cloths are easy to scrub with,handy and useful. I really like these for traveling.  They are not a liquid... and the cloths are easy to scrub with.  They are perfect to keep a few in your purse  car  and desk.  They arrived quickly and in good condition (I have prime) with some other items I ordered.,1
keeps it on all day,Don't wear your makeup without it. Makes my Maskcara highlight and contour go on like butter and keeps it on all day.  Game changer!!!  The make up is amazing without it  with it mind blowing.,1
not pliable,Terrific!. These are perfect--not pliable  and wide enough. My stove isn't level with my counter so  I really needed this.,0
cheesy ones,No way. I love Christmas movies and I've found myself watching a lot of them even though it's only September. I've watched some pretty cheesy ones but this one was just awful from the get go! The very beginning was annoying and then the opening scene with the main character told me what I needed to know. I know this is really petty but her voice was horrible and her acting was just as bad. I couldn't handle this movie after seeing what it was going to be about  it was clear it wasn't worth wasting any more time on so I turned it off.,0
music,Great music. I gave this to my mom for Christmas and she loves it!!,1
battery lasts a while,Great for kids. Really great quality for price. Nice big screen and the protector is great. It came set up to my amazon account already (I don’t know how they did that). There are a TON of free downloads. Games and shows. Charges fast and battery lasts a while. My daughter was so happy and loves it. Highly recommend,1
great value,Perfect and durable card stock. As described and great value!,1
VOLATILE,LOTS OF ALLERGIES AND BEST Essential Oils I Ever Bought.. I bought this set last June and just opened it now. The fact that the oils are SO fresh upon opening nine months later says a lot.  A few things you have to understand:  The negative review about allergy upon skin contact is only ONE case. As someone with a ton of skin sensitivities and contact dermatitis  I also got a tiny bit itchy with mixing the orange  lemongrass and rosemary onto my skin but THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. These are 100% essential oil  NOT mixed with any kind of carrier. If you go to Whole Foods and buy one of the AuraCacia oils  many are mixed with jojoba oil so that they are easier on skin. Yes  they also have a line of 100% essential oils but these are a much better value. These are FULL POTENCY and VOLATILE which means yes  they *can* burn skin and SHOULD NOT be used on or around pets (do research as I know some oils are poisonous to cats). Any full potency oil can be extremely toxic to children if ingested. If you are making a batch of homemade lotion  DIY sanitizers or whatever else  you add like 4-5 drops for every CUP of product. More than that is going to be way too much. That said  this is actually a REALLY great value for this entire set. And non-GMO  Organic?!!! AMAZING.,0
looper pedal,Not this one. Thought it also looped the guitar.  My bad. Never could sync it right with my looper pedal. Sold it after a year. Now they added a looper to the new one. Of course they did! Get the new plus version  not this one.,0
pair up with iPhone 6s,Great microphone speaker. My son loves to sing so I bought him this for xmas. It was easy to pair up with my iPhone 6s. I was able to play music from my music library or the amazon music app. Great sound. I wasn't sure how to lower the sound though from the microphone. I had to do it from my phone. And I wish there was an option to do a light show instead of just picking one LED color. Love being able to charge using USB instead of batteries. I definitely recommend this bluetooth karaoke microphone.,1
compromise by drilling holes to install,I couldn't use this on my kayak  but they are well made. These are well made and would be easy to install if I was replacing handles.  I thought I could add these to my kayak  but I'm afraid to compromise it by drilling holes to install.  These would work perfect as replacement parts.,0
not feel different,Nice supplement but on the pricey side. On the plus side  I rarely eat breakfast in the morning and I easily can take one of these with no adverse stomach or heartburn side effects. In reading the ingredients  these appear to be chock full of almost everything my 60 year old body needs to be healthy and feel energetic. I have been taking them now for two weeks and I honestly do not feel different  but I am sure it is too soon to tell. On the negative side (hence the deduction of one star)  this is almost $50 for a little over 3 week supply. I find this extremely pricey and not something that I will continue taking once I have completed the bottle (unless I have a miraculous awakening that I do not feel currently). Thinking that Centrum Silver or One a Day for Women can fill most of this for a far more reasonable price.,0
well worth the wait,Perfect quality and gift!. Perfect colors and clarity - well designed.  Well worth the wait - he loved it!,1
drinks,"Note: This is the US version / reprint of ""Curry Easy Vegetarian"". Earlier this summer  I ordered the excellent &#34[[ASIN:0091949475 Curry Easy Vegetarian]] from the UK as I adore Madhur Jaffrey (and vegetarian Indian cookbooks in general  especially the two fantastic Gujarati cookbooks by [[ASIN:1444734717 Prashad Cookbook: Indian Vegetarian Cooking]]. True to form  this is an excellent  informative guide to vegetarian cooking across India that includes over 200 recipes for vegetables (roasted  stir-fried  curry)  dals  grains (pilaf  flattened rice  upmas)  breads and pancakes  numerous delicious egg and cheese dishes  chutneys  and drinks  sweets and desserts. From what I can tell  &#34Vegetarian India&#34 appears to be identical (as referenced in the book's title page) but in US measurements  so if you already own &#34Curry Easy Vegetarian &#34 you will be getting the exact same recipes. This is a lovely  user-friendly introduction to vegetarian Indian cuisine highly recommended.",1
love them,Love them. Love these lights  ordered another set,1
surprises,A relaxing honeymoon?. As I have said before each book is better than the last one...there are so many surprises in this book including the &#34who done it&#34   it will keep you guessing. This is a series that you really will enjoy..ok for me it's on to book 10!,1
repetitive exercises,A disappointing and lazy collection of basic trig problems. This book is very disappointing to me as a workbook: the exercise is EXCEEDINGLY repetitive. Please note I that I understand the importance of practice  but this one is going overboard  and it did so without really improving the understanding.  As a trig book  it also misses a very important topic: graphing the sinusoidal functions  identifying period  midline  and amplitude. It has NONE of those. All in all  I think this is a LAZY collection of exercise and has 1/10 of the value that it is suppose to have.,0
nice heavy metal,Perfection. Used these as game day mvp recognition for my basketball they are nicely made and nice heavy metal the team loved them made them feel special,1
key rings,Great Set!. A few weeks ago  my children and I started crafting with resin. One of our friends saw our initial pieces and requested an initial. Well  we needed a new mold then! This is a great mold that has all of the letters A-Z and digits 0-9. The molds aren't too shallow so the finished letters are a good thickness. The set also comes with some fun accessories such as the tassels and key rings. There's also some glitter and a tool for putting the holes in to the finished letters. I ended up ordering some different key rings  because I wanted clips so we could clip our initials to our bags if we wanted. Overall  this is a fun set to have.,1
cardboard bucket,Baby Aspen Four-piece Gift Set. purchased for a beach themed baby shower and it was huge hit.... the grandma-to-be carried it around.  The &#34bucket&#34 is cardboard... the items are soft and very cute in person.  The color is sort of a bluish gray.  It arrived quickly (I have prime) with some other things I had ordered. i put it inside of a whale baby tub  along with a diaper bag set. This set made a lovely  unique gift.  Nice to give something there weren't several of.,1
stitching on these have started coming off,They suck.. I have used these for 2 months.  They have kept my hands warm when it is above 32.  Below 32 and I have to add another layer.  The stitching on these have started coming off.  Also the touch screen sections are extremely annoying.  I have now given up on these and switched to flip top mittens that are for ice fishing.,0
soft dress leather,Beautiful well made elegant gloves. These soft dress leather (not suede) gloves are true to size  have a warm wool lining  length is slightly longer than wrist length (as pictured)  and the leather bow trim is very nicely done.  These were a great value for the price.  I would not hesitate to purchase Kursheuel gloves again.,1
easy to handle,Beautiful. This is a beautiful puzzle That you will enjoy putting together. The pc are easy to handle not flimsy and thin And fit together very well.,1
sleeps comfortably,"Looks great too!. My girlfriend loved it because ""it sleeps comfortably"" and ""it fits""!",1
stainless steel,Five stars. I just love Bar Keepers Friend products  and I am very excited to get a new product from them.  I use this on stainless steel mostly.,1
doesn't fix,Bad plastic nut. Doesn't fix.. Don't like it at all. Do not recommend.,0
FAST Shipping,FAST Shipping!. Ordered this book for my father in law for Christmas & the shipping was FAST. Item arrived as expected. Can't wait to give it to him.,1
thick hair,Really like these. So why 4 stars?  I read the review  measured it out and decided for the large instead of the next larger choice  because I really have some thick hair.  They are so pretty  and they even gave me an extra stick. I love using them however I can't use them as I did when I was younger (yes in the 70's).  I can't get the barrette around my hair - I have to use a band first - which defeats both it being pretty and it's use to begin with.  I can attach it  but not around 'all' of my hair.  So I should have ordered the larger ones  because I was trying to omit the band altogether as they give my headaches which is why I used them back in the day.  So I eventually cut my hair length and now use these just to tack the front hair back.  If you have really thick hair  buy the larger size!,1
blind bake,Make showstopping desserts on your countertop with minimal effort!. I’m a fairly recent convert to the slow cooker bandwagon I only purchased my first slow cooker a couple of years ago and started out by baking my way through all the desserts in Michele Scicolone’s excellent “The Mediterranean Slow Cooker ” which introduced me to the joys of making flan  cheesecake  and fruit compote in the slow cooker.  Fast forward several years later and I was looking to expand my slow cooker desserts repertoire  so imagine my delight when I got an e-mail from Lisa Ekus that highlighted “Slow Cooker Desserts” by Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore! Roxanne and Kathy are cookbook authors  food consultants  cooking teachers and food bloggers who have written seven cookbooks and a popular blog  www.pluggedintocooking.com.  As soon as my copy of “Slow Cooker Desserts” arrived  I couldn’t wait to dig in to the many inviting recipes covering not only cakes and cheesecakes  but also bread puddings  fruits  and candy and fondues. The book opens with a good compact guide to slow cookers  bakeware  and ingredients. The layout is uncluttered and straightforward  and each recipe is followed by helpful tips  making it perfect for novice bakers. The gorgeous photography by Jennifer Davick deserves a special mention as well.  The first recipe I tried was the Praline-Pumpkin Cheesecake. I decided to substitute a gingersnap crust for the graham crackers  and it added the perfect touch of spice to complement the spices in the cheesecake filling. Note that you do need to blind bake the gingersnap crust prior to baking in the slow cooker  but this only adds a few minutes to the prep time. Also  perhaps it was the brand of gingersnaps I used  but I would recommend adding a little extra melted butter until the crust comes together – the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter for ½ cup crumbs. One thing I would suggest is to also liberally spray the sides of your springform pan as well – mine is supposedly nonstick  but I followed the recipe (which only specifies to spray the bottom of the pan) and a large portion of my cheesecake edges stuck and broke. I normally do spray the entire pan with Baker’s Joy  but I follow the recipes as written when I am testing for reviews.  The finished cheesecake texture is very fluffy and a bit crumbly  so I did have difficulty cutting it neatly I’m not sure if I may have beat TOO much air into my filling and will beat for less next time. The praline topping (made in the microwave in under three minutes) is destined to become my new secret weapon in the kitchen! This homemade caramel was delicious and deceptively easy and would also make a great addition to ice cream or cakes. All combined (gingersnap crust  spiced pumpkin filling  praline topping)  this is a great fall dessert with minimal effort and also frees up your oven for other baking tasks.  The second recipe I tried was the candied cranberry and crystallized ginger chutney this one called my name because I am a certified fiend when it comes to candied ginger. I had a bag of organic cranberries in the freezer that I was looking to use up  so it worked out perfectly that I already had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry (even the ginger liqueur!). My bag of organic cranberries was slightly smaller than the 16-oz. bag called for in the recipe  so I scaled back on the sugar quite a bit as I was using candied ginger (I used ¾ cup sugar in place of the 1 ¼ in the recipe  and it was plenty sweet for me). It also had the bonus of making my kitchen smell amazing as it cooked! I cooked mine down for a little longer the recipe says that it should be thin  but I like my chutney on the very thick side more like a compote. The recipe calls for between 5 to 7 hours on low and I ended up cooking mine for 3 hours on high due to time. This would be fantastic stirred into yogurt  as an accompaniment to Indian food  or even as a side dish in place of jellied cranberries or cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.  The third recipe was the chocolate cashew clusters. I’d seen slow cooker candy (including nut clusters) pop up in my Facebook feed  but I’d never tried making it before. The recipe uses salted cashews  semisweet and milk chocolate chips  a dark chocolate candy bar  and candy coating to create decadent nut clusters that look like they came from a candy shop. These take about 1 ½ hours on low plus cooling / set time (3 to 5 hours).  Other recipes on my to-make list from “Slow Cooker Desserts” include the cinnamon-calvados applesauce  rice pudding with cherries  and many of the cheesecakes (brownie chunk  German chocolate  ginger-peach  coconut cream) and cakes (cider-glazed apple-walnut cake  Southern sweet potato cake  pineapple butter cake). There is enough variety and possible variations (I need to find a way to make a cookie butter cheesecake!) to keep you happily baking for months to come.

legs on to my low slung couch,Fantastic!. Got the legs on to my low slung couch.  Went on very nicely.  So nice to have a little more height.  Good product all wood which was important.  Very sturdy,1
perfect guide to demystify the process,"A handy  well-designed collection of both baking classics and new favorites. I have about 50 baking books ranging the gamut from heritage recipes like [[ASIN:1579125883 Heirloom Baking with the Brass Sisters: More than 100 Years of Recipes Discovered from Family Cookbooks  Original Journals  Scraps of Paper  and Grandmother's Kitchen]] to regional baking of Italy  France  Turkey  and Mexico. When I saw the Taste of Home Baking book  I jumped at the chance to review it.  The recipes come in a sturdy three-ring binder with a removable plastic splashguard. I loved the idea of the splashguard  although I would have liked to see a notes section at the back. The inside covers contain a handy list of food equivalents and ingredient substitutions  and the primer on baking basics is illustrated with numerous color photos.  Index:  Cookies Cakes Bars Cupcakes Cheesecakes Pies and tarts Desserts Quick Breads Muffins  Biscuits  and Scones Yeast Breads Yeast Rolls Coffee Cakes and Sweet Rolls Almost Homemade Trimmed-Down Favorites Holiday Classics  Each recipe has a short comment or introduction by its author  along with the author's name and hometown. The recipe ingredients are printed in an easy-to-read bold font  and steps are clearly numbered. There is no nutritional info provided.  You'll find plenty of familiar favorites here  along with some new and intriguing combinations. For years  our family made snowballs  a nut-and-butter cookie with a hidden Hershey's Kiss in the center. I found an instant new favorite in the chocolate macadamia meltaways a similar idea  except that you make chocolate-and-macadamia centers  chill them  then wrap the macadamia butter dough around them and bake.  For those who have always wanted to try working with yeast  but found it intimidating  this is the perfect guide to demystify the process. There are several chapters on yeast breads  yeast rolls  and sweet rolls  and each chapter opens with a sidebar containing helpful hints. There is a whole page of color photos with step-by-step illustrations of kneading  shaping  and baking yeast bread  tips and troubleshooting for baking in bread machines  how to shape bagels  pretzels  cloverleaf rolls  and more.  If you're in a time crunch  the ""Almost Homemade"" chapter uses box mixes with personalized touches to create quick (and giftable) creations. The ""Trimmed Down"" chapter includes low-fat  egg-free  gluten-free and lactose-free recipes. Holiday recipes features kid-friendly favorites  mostly decorated sugar cookies (boneyard cookies  shamrock cookies  shortbread ornament cookies  etc.).  This is a great go-to baking reference that covers all major baking categories with step-by-step guidance and plenty of photos. It would make a great gift for new bakers (or college students)  since most ingredients are easy to find and there are many simplified recipes that require little time and few ingredients. To sweeten the deal  the book also comes with a free one-year subscription to [[ASIN:B004GVZUU4 Taste of Home (1-year auto-renewal)]].",1
great place to buy from,Witchy and convenient. Upon receiving these bottles  reading the enclosed booklet and reading online I'm impressed and surprised that more people haven't purchased or reviewed their products. It seems like a great place to buy from for mixing and storing essential oils and potions. I will be coming back here for more. I also read that they offer a discount in their brochure and on their website....also Black Friday sales.,1
best ever,Great quality. Coolest thing. Best ever. Handmade charm is lovely  my mother will love these.,1
tool kits are always something you need to keep handy,Always need it.. Tool kits are always something you need to keep handy. And you should have more than 1 So you can get 2 things easier. I have the 1 in the garage and then I also have 1 in my house on a book shelf. These are nice because they are strong And easy to find The 1 you need,1
used for multiple uses,Great value and used for multiple uses.. Yep  we use it for oiling the paper shredder  and for brake pads on our spin bike!  Great value for the product  don't need a lot to do the job!,1
split,Boo !. This comes in A very nice sturdy box. What I find interesting is Since this is a brand new unopened box I was not expecting any damages. I have Shown 2 pictures of how the pc are coming out of the bag. Quite a few pc were bent in half Or the ends were starting to split. And I would say out of a thousand pieces  a hundred were stuck together very tight. I didn't like having to take them apart because since they were so tight I had to damage some of the pc. In spite of that The printing is very clear on the pc And the coloring is good.,0
chalkiness,No weird taste.. Nice blend of sweet & salty without the chalkiness. Soft chew. It's good!,0
Fits the tab well,Great. Fits the tab well and has a hand strap. Also turns the screen on and off. Good buy!,1
block out the household noise around,Decent entry-level headset.. I ordered these for my son  who regularly Skypes with friends while they play together on private Minecraft servers. He likes that the headphones are light and comfortable  but says they do little to block out noise. He also has trouble with the microphone  as it only works intermittently. When he doesn't need the mic  it does easily flip up and out of the way  which is convenient for him. This headset will work for him for now  but I imagine as he gets more serious into his gaming  he'll opt for a sturdier headset that does more to block out the household noise around him.,1
easy to take gummy,Great multivitamin  everything my grandson needs in a terrifc tasting gummy!. My 6 year old grandson loves taking his vitamins this way! Not only are they dinosaur designed on the outside  but the gummies are as well. I love that they contain most of the vitamins and supplements that he needs for his growing body in an easy to take gummy. Of course  with any gummies like this you need to keep them out of the little one's reach as I know mine would eat more of them if I didn't control them. Outside of that  it's a great way to keep his health optimal and I don't need to wrestle with him to take it  lol. Great idea  great multivitamin!,1
consistency,Nice Exfoliation. My daughter is a huge fan of I Dew Care products. I ordered this for her  but I gave it a try first as I am a huge fan of body scrubs! This scrub has a waxy-like consistency. I found it best to rub it between my hands for a moment before applying it to my body. In doing so  it lathers a little bit and changes the consistency to something that won't glob onto your body. There is a good amount of grit to it  but it's not rough or scratchy. It actually does a nice job of exfoliating. I was hoping for a delicious coconut smell  but it's not. I can't pinpoint the actual scent  but it's very nice and pleasant. The scrub rinses well. Because of the waxy base of the scrub  it doesn't leave your skin feeling dry or stripped. There's no waxy build up either. I think my daughter will enjoy it. I was especially pleased with how it worked on my hands and elbows.,1
Mudbug series,I loved the whole series of Mudbug. I loved the whole series of Mudbug..Helena the ghost keeps this one funny with all the things happening to her as she &quotlearns&quot how to be a ghost.Each book tells you about the life and antics of one main character but it also combines the other ones with the new..the lives all intertwine and thtas what makes this a fun suspenseful and at time sexy read...It gets your heart pumping even just after you have laughted your a - - off lol..Going to read more from this author !!!,1

cute,a little small  but good price.. it sticks really well and is cute  just wish it stuck out more for my fingers to hold it a little easier.,1
overall an easy read,Amazing read.. Amazing read...confirmed my personal beliefs that we are already living on paradise here on earth  and it will be up to man kind to figure how to love one another in order to maintain this precious ecosystem and continue to flourish and develop as a people.  I was a bit disappointed that Bruce did not share a bit more about his personal transformation  but overall an easy read for the non-scientific minded like me!  Also I just picked up Suggestible You  by Erik Vance which was mentioned in Bruce Lipton's book and this is starting out as an amazing read as well.  If anyone has other suggested reading  please pass them along,1

innoHaus monitor is smaller than the one I had previously,Great device to keep in your home to accurately measure your blood pressure!. I had been diagnosed with elevated high blood pressure about 4 years ago. At the time  the doctor recommend I either get an at home BP measuring device or go to CVS (or someplace else) to measure it regularly. I opted for the former and had purchased a wrist BP device. The one I had 4 years ago did not work for me  it never seemed to measure my pressure accurately and I found the readings to typically show I was very high followed almost immediately with a low reading. Anyway  I stopped using it and started several times a week getting my BP taken at the stores. When I saw this innoHaus monitor I thought I would try it to see if the technology has improved over the years. To my surprise this wrist device is smaller than the one I had previously and is incredibly accurate. Whether I take it one time  wait 20 seconds and retake it  the results are consistent. I love the way it fits and it is now my staple and I no longer really need to do it outside my home any more. I highly recommend this device to anyone who would like a home BP monitoring system.,1

LED color,Great microphone speaker. My son loves to sing so I bought him this for xmas. It was easy to pair up with my iPhone 6s. I was able to play music from my music library or the amazon music app. Great sound. I wasn't sure how to lower the sound though from the microphone. I had to do it from my phone. And I wish there was an option to do a light show instead of just picking one LED color. Love being able to charge using USB instead of batteries. I definitely recommend this bluetooth karaoke microphone.,1

light beam widens/sharpens,Feit LED flashlight 1000/260 lumens. I purchased my first Feit flashlight set from Costco and have been looking for more ever since.  I found these.. I purchased the 1000/260 lumens and the 500.  The 1000 is bigger  but I am disappointed at how lightweight it is. The 500 is a mini flashlight.  I had to read a lot of stuff to find out about how to switch from the full on to the less bright/less battery sucking brightness.  You toggle the power button... push once it's bright  press again it's less bright.  The neck pulls back and forth to widen or sharpen the light beam.  It's ok.  But no where near the quality of my first set.  Having said all of that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,0
wine ratings,"Wine Reviews  News  and More. Wine Spectator is a good wine magazine that seeks to keep the reader informed about new wine products  wine facts and education  and wine events. This magazine is published 17 times per year  so it is available often enough that most wine lovers will have more than their fill of reading material.  Most of the material in Wine Spectator deals with buying wine  and you can expect to find several rating lists in every issue. The editors of the magazine supply the majority of the wine ratings  so when you read that one wine earned 95 points and another only 80  you need to keep in mind that these ratings are from the perspective of people who have sampled hundreds or even thousands of different wines. And with each rating or analysis  there is often contact information  such as the name of the winery or web page  so that you can learn more and/or inquire on making a purchase.  To help shoppers find the wines in each issue  Wine Spectator includes a detachable card that includes the names of the different featured wines. This is a handy addition  because it eliminates the need to copy down names of wine on paper or attempt to memorize the titles. All you do is check off the wines you like on the card and take it with you to your favorite beverage store for easy reference.  Wine Spectator seems to have an obsession with lists and with outlandish proclamations. It is common to find lists like ""World's 100 Greatest Pinot"" or ""The 50 Finest California Reds"". Consumers are attracted to listings  and that is probably why the magazine gave in and made lists a regular part of most issues. And it is common to find extreme statements like ""This is the best Cabernet Sauvignon on the Planet"" or ""Greatest German White Wine Ever"". The publication does this to attract attention and sell more issues  but it could get annoying to some readers.  In spite of these few annoyances  Wine Spectator is still a good magazine. The writers at Wine Spectator are very good  very convincing  and very persuasive. They really know wine  and it comes through in their articles and recommendations. The editors articulate themselves very well and they know just the right way to describe the different brands and styles. It all adds up to a very informative magazine publication on the world of wine.",1

night light,plug extender with shelf. This is really great.  I use the shelf for my cup dispenser and my sonic toothbrush.  I have WAY more plug in options than I need... a bunch of plug ins INCLUDING USB ports!  Further  there is a night light.  It points directly at my toilet cubby so it's about perfect.  It plugged right into the wall plug and is VERY stable even without the screw (I put into a GFI  so I couldn't use the center screw).  The only negative I have to report is that the plugins are all toward the front.  I wish there was a side plug in so that the plug head of my toothbrush didn't stick straight out... Eh.  That's a small complaint  I couldn't ding a star for that cause it's kinda a personal thing.  The shelf has little grooves that was SUPER easy to slide the shelf right on.  The unit is bright white (works perfectly in my white bathroom).  To be honest  I didn't think I was gonna love this as much as I do.  Having said all that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1

highlights touching upon every album,"The mother of all motherships. Led Zeppelin lent inspiration to hundreds of bands  not to mention millions of listeners.

A favorite or two might be missing  of course  but that's true of any (all?) ""Best of"" collections  yes?  Five blimps flying high and strong from me.",0
do not change the flavor of the beverage being brewed,Flexibility To Our Brewing !. These MaxRona reusable K cups are exactly what we needed for our Keurig brewer. They're simple to use  fit perfectly in the machine and allow us to brew whatever coffee/tea we want-we're not tied down to buying K cup pods only for our machine.  They do not  in any way  change the flavor of the beverage being brewed in the brewer.  Every cup we brew is delicious and perfect.  While the reusable K cups are dishwasher safe  our is broken so I hand wash them after each use. They clean well with no issues.  I love the flexibility of being able to brew anything we want that comes with these reusable K cups.  They're wonderful but if you're not satisfied  MaxRona offers a 100% money back or replacement guarantee!,1

luv it,Four Stars. luv it,1
not very nice characters,Poorly done (decent cast  poor plot  erratic story line and not very nice characters). Truly poor - shallow  poorly developed & unlikeable characters who didn’t seem to even like each other.  A bride who showed zero concern for her missing groom-to-be throughout the entire movie.  Poor script  weak plot and over-the-top acting.  This is drivel & a waste of time to watch.  I've read many 'cosy mysteries' and this movie tries to bring one to the screen  but the entire plot is poorly developed and the characters are unreal.  For example  one character goes from making love to her old boyfriend who soon afterwards pushes her off a cliff allegedly because she had previously broken up their relationship.  Not even soap opera good.,0

installation took about 1/2 a day,Mighty Mule Gate. We had a 20 year old might mule gate that FINALLY gave out - we live on the oceanfront in northern Oregon.  So  we purchased a new Mighty Mule.  Because this one is new and updated  it did take my husband (who had electrical skills) about 1/2 a day to install.  Then a new method of training the clickers and autos - but all is functioning now and it is strong and sturdy.  Hopefully it will last long as the first one.  In all fairness  with the old one we did replace the batteries and a couple of various pieces of the 20 years - but these are things that you expect. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
ongoing bone of contention,The 1966 / 1968 foundations of two more 'lost' Elvis LPs. Just who was sleeping at the wheel at RCA back in the mid- to late-sixties?  At least in the case of Elvis Presley's recording career  I think they were just sick and tired and worn-out from dealing with his manager  Colonel Tom Parker.  Movies ruled in Parker's world  so Elvis' recording career was on the back burner.  Or was it?  Elvis continued to do non-film recording sessions at RCA's Studio B in Nashville  often with thrilling results.  Instead of issuing cohesive LPs from the sessions  however  Parker scattered the tracks over singles A- and B-sides  soundtrack album 'bonus ' songs  and budget LP filler.  Where the heck was RCA's A&R advisors?  For diehard Elvis fans like yours truly  this was an ongoing bone of contention for years.  Years when LPs had become much more prominent and important in the post-Beatles sixties.  This 18-track compilation presents  in essence  a double-dip of what might have been: Superior material that would have been the basis of two more solid Elvis albums in 1966 and 1968.  The Grammy winning How Great Thou Art was the non-soundtrack studio LP of 1967.  Love Letters  Down in the Alley  I'll Remember You  Guitar Man  Big Boss Man  You Don't Know Me  and the magnificent Dylan cover title song are among the highlights but  in truth  there's not a bad track to be found here.  Oh  what might have been ... Happily  we can all enjoy it now the way it should have been all those years ago.  Five brightly shining stars and very highly recommended.,0
trustworthy reviewer,sparkle lens covers with 'crystals' on rim. Samsung watch 4  40mm  frame covers.  I love sparkle  however  these are really rough and snag things - thus I removed it and tossed.  I wish the 'sparkle' crystal edge had been better polished and/or set in so they would not be so scratchy.  Eh.   Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever.

Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes.

D'amour ou d'amitié,A good introduction to Céline's earlier works. Long before Beauty and the Beast and her first English-language albums  Céline was already a star in her native Québec. She has been recording albums since 1981  and until a few years ago her earliest albums were only  available on records. But 19 songs from 1981-1988 are now available on this  collection  including the rarest  Ce n'était qu'un rêve. Céline's mother  wrote the song for her twelve-year old daughter and it was this song that  joined Céline's destiny with that of her husband and manager René  Angélil.   Many of Céline's early hits are featured here  including  D'amour ou d'amitié and Ne partez pas sans moi. Also included are a number  of B-sides (the rare L'amour viendra  Visa pour les beaux jours  etc.) and  the complete lyrics to each song. Sorry  no translations are given in the  CD booklet.  This is an excellent CD for fans of Céline to become  aquainted with her earlier works en français. It is well worth the price.  Do yourself a favour and buy this CD today!,1

durable,Perfect size. These pots are attractive  durable  and a great value.  They are perfect for succulents  and their 4 inch size allows room to drop in a 3 inch planting pot.  I love the wooden saucer  and will be looking for it whenever I shop for planters again.,1
should have ordered the larger ones,Really like these. So why 4 stars?  I read the review  measured it out and decided for the large instead of the next larger choice  because I really have some thick hair.  They are so pretty  and they even gave me an extra stick. I love using them however I can't use them as I did when I was younger (yes in the 70's).  I can't get the barrette around my hair - I have to use a band first - which defeats both it being pretty and it's use to begin with.  I can attach it  but not around 'all' of my hair.  So I should have ordered the larger ones  because I was trying to omit the band altogether as they give my headaches which is why I used them back in the day.  So I eventually cut my hair length and now use these just to tack the front hair back.  If you have really thick hair  buy the larger size!,0

not useful to me,Very warm  but waist is way too big. Unfortunately the waist slides all the way down my hips. I will only be able to wear these under a belt or tight garments that will hold the waist up. They are very warm  but that's not useful to me if I can't wear them.,0
powerful,Better to use on a partner than to use on yourself. I have owned several massage guns over the years to assist me with the neck and shoulder pain I have had over the years. I saw this one and wanted to try it. It is super powerful but is not the easiest to maneuver on my own (it was much easier to use on someone else than on myself).  I had a lot of difficulty holding it steady while trying to apply to my shoulder. I did try to use it on my calves and it was much better there. So  bottom line  not good for yourself if you are trying to reach areas that are not convenient (back of the neck  shoulders) but it is great for you to use on others. Just a little difficult to control.,1

I ordered the small/medium size even though I should have ordered a large because I take a size 9 to 9.5 shoe. Nevertheless  these fit me perfectly and the large would have been too big. The compression is strong  so I do find these difficult to wear all day.  The only thing I do not like about these socks is that they come up to my lower thighs which requires me to fold them over to get them below my knees.,1
bigger than I expected,Great for the developing musical protegy in your home!. I love this Melissa & Doug Upright Piano. Beautiful colors  quality made  bigger than I expected and an amazing sound from what is considered a children's toy. My grandson who is three absolutely adores this (he even likes when I make a melody out of playing Chopsticks  lol). I can see where in another year he will be able to play little tunes on it. For now  he loves experimenting with the sounds  going from low to high and back again. I come from a musical family and I have always prided myself on introducing my own children (and now my grandchildren) to the wonderful world of music. This Melissa & Doug Upright Piano is the perfect way to start a toddler learning to love music at an early age. This would make a wonderful Christmas gift under the tree this year for the future virtuoso in your family!,1
love these pillow covers,Worth the money. I love these pillow covers  they look great   was up beautiful and are rurable.,1
not super real time,Blink 2. We own many of these... this set is for our daughter.  Convinced a neighbor to purchase as well.  SUPER easy to install and easy to set up on your smart phone.  No monthly fees.  YOU are the monitor.  They aren't perfect  sometimes not super real time  but they work - and they improve the performance regularly.  If you cameras  overall  I haven't found anything better.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,0
size chart is very accurate,"Ring the Alarm!!!. Someone should call the cops because looking this good should be a crime. This jumpsuit is oh-so-glam! I honestly can't believe how great it looks for the price. The fabric is a lightweight chiffon-like fabric with a hint of stretch. As a woman with rippled thighs  I was concerned about the combination of a light color and a thin fabric. No worries!! There's no show-through even though the pants are unlined. If you're a larger cup size  you'll probably need to wear a tube top or bandeau under this for more coverage. I'm not judging if you want to show off your goodies. The belt is long enough to wrap around twice. I did this for extra cinching. The color I chose is more of a sage green than a true mint. Pay close attention to the size chart. I found it to be very accurate. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the X-Large.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
cut through two mating shafts with hardly any noticeable wear on a single disc,Good quality and effective. Used to size a power take off shaft for a new tractor implement. Was able to cut through two mating shafts with hardly any noticeable wear on a single disc. I will be keeping a supply of these in my tools.,1
quality,Good quality. Nice so far.  Decent quality.,1
colorful,Fit deep twin xl  nicely. Soft  warm  colorful  fit an extra deep twin xl  nicely! Would buy again. Keep in mind they are microfiber not traditional cotton sheets.,1
cigarette light charger,Not What I Expected. I ordered this thinking it had a cigarette light charger so I could use it in my car. Nope - it has a standard USB charger. It has a cigarette LIGHTER so you can light your cigarette. Well  I have no need for a cigarette lighter  plus I think that could be a dangerous item for someone with kids. It does have a variety of charging types which is helpful and those work well. I don't have any apple products  so I couldn't test that out  but the others worked fine. I think the description needs to be improved so others don't make the same mistake that I do.,0
keeps my papers safe,Very useful for keeping important papers.. Wish it was not so expensive. Very sturdy. Keeps my papers safe. Easy to store on book shelf.,1
works great,This speaker works great!. I love that I can put the speaker in the shower or take it to the beach without being concerned about it getting wet.  Good sound  charges easily.,1
makes my plants grow real good,:) Worth the money :). I guess I could get dirt out of the ground but I’m a busy modern woman and miracle grow soil makes my plants grow real good!!! The size is reasons 4 my indoor garden and the price makes it my go to :),1
well done historical fiction,Loosely based on Margaret Mead's early life - a suspenseful page turner!. I really enjoyed this book  especially because it is apparently loosely based on Margaret Mead's life (a revelation in itself!)  As a young girl  I was very interested in Margaret Mead's work as an cultural anthropologist.  She was a role model and hero for me.  A woman who chose to go off exploring the world's most primitive cultures in untamed wilderness. Lily King writes beautifully  she has created well-developed  very human characters with strengths and weaknesses and both higher and baser desires.  This is an interesting story with  very believable  conflict and tension.  The conclusion of the novel is satisfying in a real-life  yet surprisingly suspenseful way.  I would definitely read another book by Lily King and recommend this to anyone who enjoys well done historical fiction.,1
microneedling facials,Great microneedling pen for at home use!. I typically go for microderms and facials several times a month and it can add up money-wise. I have gotten microneedling facials done in the past and they typically run about $100-150 for a good one. I noticed that the last one I had received earlier this year  the spa tech was using a Dr. Pen. So  when I saw this  I wondered how easy it would be to try to do this myself. I was so surprised to see it was easy! In spite of the fact that it is a little uncomfortable with the deeper settings  I knew that I was going to see a noticeable improvement. After using this three times in the last two months  I can vouch for how great (and young) my skin looks. I do need to use some aloe vera after use (to keep the redness down). The results are just as good (if not better) than doing it in a spa setting. Highly recommend!,1
good quality,Bows. These are great and pretty bows bought them to make easter baskets  good quality will defiantly be ordering more great value for your money!,1
use a new one every month,Work great. work great. use a new one every month,1
fresh quality spice,Great fresh quality spice!. This is a nice larger size bottle of thyme. I use thyme for a lot of my cooking (soups  stews  gravies) so I  wanted a large size. I had never heard of Cerez Pazari before so I was pleasantly surprised. This thyme is a nice full size  smells and tastes super fresh. I am buying other CP products because I was so pleased with this one. I love the large size too. Highly recommend for every chef and kitchen.,1
healthier,Great facial serum made a noticeable difference in my skin!. This is a really nice facial serum containing collagen. I typically use a serum every morning on my face after showering and have done so for at least 20 years or so now (at the recommendation of my dermatologist). I really like this new serum from Manilla. I always thought Asian women had beautiful skin and now I think it might have to do with the rice milk ingredient (something I never tried before). This serum goes on light and absorbs easily into my skin. It has a light fragrance that I really like  too. My skin over the past few weeks has begun to look noticeably healthier  smoother and has a definite glow. I will be ordering more. Highly recommend!,1
nice looking,This floating log is perfect for my smaller turtles to get away from the .... This floating log is perfect for my smaller turtles to get away from the larger turtles and peek out the portholes.  Made of sturdy materials and nice looking.,1
fit pretty well,Great for hiking. Used this with our 10 year old shih tzu and it went really well. She fit pretty well and really enjoyed being carried everywhere. Yes  she was scared at first  but then she got used to it and got over it (pretty quickly).,1
Susan looks like the others,"One fantastic story !!!. When you're 20  eager to go on an adventure during the summer  it shouldn't matter that your dad is a sheriff right? Before going off to college  Susan wants to have some fun  hitch hiking to see a concert  by herself. But what she doesnt know is there is a serial killer on the loose  targeting young red haired girls that look just like she does. When 2 detectives are on the case and investigating the murder of their latest victim  one of them notices how much Susan looks like the others... hunky detective Michael gets the urge to protect Susan.  There is the old saying ""things dont always go as planned"". This is one of those stories  it will keep you on the edge of your seat. Susan is tested to see how strong she really is and does she have the courage to stop this abusive killer? Great story that I highly reccommend to everyone who loves a great  short read that you cant put down !! I cant wait for the next installment to find out what happens to Susan and Michael.",0
images are crisp and colorful,Nice Quality Puzzle. This is beautiful puzzle. It's a nice quality. The pieces are very sturdy and the images are crisp and colorful. I did not have any peeling images. The pieces are marked for easy sorting. My favorite part is that it comes with a large poster of the image. That is so much easier than holding the box to see where the pieces go.,1
narrow,Good but.... I know it is a pipette but it is just too narrow for what I needed.  Do be careful as they are glass and can break.,0
some scary parts,Disney's cartoon Beauty and the Beast. This movie is my big  burly husband's favorite Disney movie for whatever reason.  We watch it and at the end he says  lets watch it again... sigh.  It's a sweet story with a typical life lesson involved.  The animation is top notch and the music is astonishing.  If you aren't singing along and dancing at the best parts  you might be dead.  There are some scary parts in a few places (in case you have really little ones) but mostly it's a movie for all ages - I still can't get over Robby Benson as the voice of the beast.  You listen and see if you can hear it..  so NOT obvious.  He had such a soft  gentle voice - not in this film! We purchase all our movies via stream any more so we don't have to store DVDs.  You can load on most any device and/or stream where ever you have wifi access.  Easy peasy.,0
Mud Pack facial products,Wonderful product! Highly recommend!. I need to begin by saying I absolutely love Ahava products. I found Ahava on a pilgrimage I did to Israel in 2008 and a visit to the site of Masada at the Dead Sea. I picked up a gift package of a few of their products and I was immediately hooked. Every day I use their Mud exfoliator  at night I use their night cream and at least once a week I use one of their Mud Pack facial products. I am 61 years old and am often told I look to be in my low 50s. I was thrilled when I saw this new Ahava Osmoter product. I have been using this daily now for about a week and I will say my skin feels and looks like it is glowing. It goes on like silk  has a nice subtle fragrnace and my skin feels amazing throughout the day (even after I put on makeup and/or sun screen). I know this is pricy and you might be able to do better purchasing elsewhere (if you find it cheaper). You won't find a product line that is better for you than Ahava  feeding your skin richly with Dead Sea minerals and keeping you looking young and vibrant.,1
perfect gift,Very nice gift. perfect gift or even a grab bag item,1
fast delivery,Five Stars. Good price and fast delivery.,1
less splash,Doesn’t last long. I have found other product that last longer with less splash,0
good for the environment,Great gum  texture and flavor are fantastic and long lasting! And good for the environment as well!. Need to start by saying I love Extra gums. Used to be an exclusive Trident user  but I found that Extra gum tends to last longer and the flavor is as great an hour from now as it was when you first popped it in your mouth. This new packaging is fantastic. First it's 'green' and made of recyclable plastic which I love and it's a huge 35 count pack. This is perfect for storing in my purse and especially will be great when I travel to Europe next month. The spearmint flavor is wonderful and like I said  extra long lasting. I prefer this new packaging style and make better than anything I have seen on the market. I will be picking up more at my local Publix this weekend (if they have them). Just wonderful!,1
sturdy,Sturdy & compact.. GREAT !!!!!,1
great insole for foot comfort,Great insole for foot comfort and great for the environment!. Good quality insole made with recycled materials. I've always loved Dr. Scholl's products and this insole is no exception. Soft yet firm  makes it so much easier for me to go through the day on my feet. I love the fact that it is made with recycled materials and is better for the environment. I will be using these going forward since I like them so much. Highly recommend.,1
clasp was hard to get into the grommet,Cute!. This is a cute clear purse. It's definitely a better alternative to the sporty looking clear bags out there. I did have some difficulties attaching the strap to the bag. The clasp was hard to get into the grommet and I ended up getting my finger caught at one point. Other than that  it's a nice bag and will work well for an upcoming concert I am attending.,0
beautiful puzzle,Nice Quality Puzzle. This is beautiful puzzle. It's a nice quality. The pieces are very sturdy and the images are crisp and colorful. I did not have any peeling images.

takes practice,Been obsessed with gels 💅🏻. I've had an obsession with gels with my time off from work these past months and I wanted to try this color changing polish. It comes with designs and while the color itself is dark it does change. I am enjoying trying the designs but man it does take practice!!!,0
holds a lot,Quality Recycling Bin. Very sturdy  large recycling bin. It holds  a lot and will last longer than the cheap one supplied by my township!,1
easy to use with easy to change heat settings,Keeps my feet nice and toasty!. If there's one part of my body that always seems to be cold  it's my feet. I live in northern Florida and  especially this time of year  our mornings and evenings tend to be on the cool side. I keep this plugged in on my family room floor and it's great to put my feet in after a long day of work. Super easy to use with easy to change heat settings. Highly recommend to everyone. This also would make a great gift for someone you love.,1

great quick healthy recipes,I really enjoy this magazine over others. I get tons of women's magazines.  Most of them I don't need or just flip through them.  I find this one I actually read cover to cover. I find so many things in this magazine that is interesting and fun.  Some Great quick healthy recipes too. If you have to cut down and get fewer magazines in you home   this one is the one to stay with! Informative.  Good articles  good pics  and the recipes are great.,1

favorite trumpet,best out of three. I have been playing the trumpet for nearly 15 years and I have tried a number of trumpets and owned three.this trumpet song which is played by many professionals by far is my favorite and has a beautiful sound. As one grows professionally and becomes more experienced with their musical talent I highly recommend purchasing this trumpets if pursuing music or continuing with music is your desire.,1
should have more than 1,Always need it.. Tool kits are always something you need to keep handy. And you should have more than 1 So you can get 2 things easier.

lightly scented,Pampers are great diapers!. These diapers are great.  They are absorbent and lightly scented.  I've had no problems with leaking.,1
comfortable,Festive Masks!. For the first year of the pandemic  I primarily wore reusable cloth masks. This fall I started wearing disposable ones. I like to coordinate my masks to my outfits or the seasons. I'm very happy with these Christmas masks. They're individually wrapped. The masks feel a little thicker than some of the other disposable ones I've used. They're soft  too. I like the designs a lot. They have the metal nosebridge piece. The elastic ear straps are secured between layers of the mask rather than attached on the side. They seem very secure. They're also comfortable. I will be wearing these as soon as Thanksgiving is over!,1
quality conical burr grinder,French Press works better. I was so excited to use this for cold brew since I love so many OXO products  but this was a disappointment. I’ve been making cold brew in a French press until now  and I have been pleased with the results  but since it requires hands on filtering  I thought this OXO system would simplify the filtering and allow the machine to do most of the work. Wrong. With a French Press  once the coffee has brewed  I can press the coffee and separate most of the grounds from the cold brew. Then I slowly pour it out into a mesh filter lined with a paper filter and wait for it to slowly seep through. I have to change the paper filter half way through before pouring the second half. With this OXO system  you are supposed to be able to flip the switch and the cold brew will drip down in to the glass carafe below. But the grounds kept clogging the filter and then absolutely no liquid could get through. (I will also note that I have a quality conical burr grinder  so the grind should not be an issue.) I had to stand over it for about 15 min scraping the grounds to the side or scooping spoonfuls of grounds out of the brewing container. After 15 minutes of this  we were left with roughly 2/3 of the volume of cold brew we would have gotten from the same recipe in a French press. The reduced volume was partially due to me scooping grounds out of the way and throwing them in the sink  and partially because there was no way to effectively press the liquid out of the grounds. Also the taste was inferior. Again probably because the most concentrated cold brew couldn’t be pressed out of the grounds. Overall the taste was nowhere as good and the process was more cumbersome than a French press. I wish I loved this machine  but on the plus side  it’s one less thing to sit on my counter and take up more space in the fridge.,0
people will be happy,Didn't realize how handy This would become. I have a lot of puzzle Boards  Caddies for the puzzle pieces and even Added a lazy Susan to my original puzzle board. I didn't realize how much I needed this box holder as well !!! Lol. With most puzzles you get a poster to help you And for that I use a recipe holder. Who the thought there'd be so many things for puzzles but you need them all. This 1 is very light wood and very well made. And since it's for puzzles you have to put it together. .... Pretty smart. I would advise every puzzle lover to get one of these. And maybe some extras for gifts..people will be so happy to get one and thank you when they realize how they need it.,1
clean and masculine fragrance,Just a lovely clean masculine fragrance that smells like a good soap. I use essential oils in my diffusers and this sandalwood essential oil is perfect for that. This is also great for those who make body butters or other lotions.  The fragrance is  clean and masculine and smells like a good soap. I use anywhere from 3 - 5 drops in my diffuser depending on the size of my water reservoir. The resulting aroma is lovely.  The current price of $15.99 for this large 3.38 fluid ounce bottle is reasonable as it comes to less than $5 per ounce.,1
charges a phone very quickly,Weak Magnet. This charges a phone very quickly but that is about the only positive thing about it.  The magnet is not very strong at all.  Barely holds onto a 14 pro max with a MagSafe case on it.  Barely bumped the phone will fall.  Works a little better with a 14 mini.  The AirPod charger charges very slow even though it gets the AirPods very warm.,1
retained their flex and didn't break,Great medium flex guitar pics. I was playing PRS mediums and they kept breaking. These .73 Dunlap picks are more durable. I played a festival gig today   like 30 songs and they retained their flex and didn't break. Bravo.,1
dancing and singing along,Great CD with all the old favorites!. I had sort of forgotten (HOW COULD I??) these great songs  but what a great gift to myself this is! I was dancing and singing along from the first to the last song!!!,1
great voice,little bit of rock  a little bit of country and a little bit of rap. it is funny  how within one song you can get a real mix of composition!  for a new comer  she has a great voice and like a review before  she definately has a bit of carrie underwood  a bit of pussycat  and a little bit of Wyonna too.  The lyrics are definately more country orientated.  Strong voice  great music beat and many of the songs  I couldnt help tapping my feet and I am going to incorporate many of songs in my personal spinning exercise program.  Definately a good album to play in an open car!,1
perfect and did not sting their skin,Great for kids with eczema!. I have two kids with eczema on their hands and they cannot use regular alcohol wipes.  These wipes were perfect and did not sting their skin and it wipes clean!  They don't leave a residue after wiping either which is a plus!,1
isn’t even being delivered in time,Love the product but it hasn’t worked long for me.....twice. I am bummed to be only able to give this 2 stars because I love the product and the fact that you have 2 batteries. However  I bought one and it only lasted a couple of months of user time before it wouldn’t work and just make a loud screeching sound in my ear. I decided to order another one hoping it was just a fluke (because  as I mentioned  I really like the product) but after another couple of months of use  the batteries won’t charge and I have 2 charging cords. I love the product but am leery of paying another $25 if it’s only going to last a couple of months.  Update: ugh....I decided to order this for a third time and it isn’t even being delivered in time (as it was promised).,0
not too long,wife / daughter love it. my review is from there perspective as one of those edgy romantic comedies and I must of missed things they got.  both liked how  Carell was funny but yet caring. the blunders seemed to be honest and could almost happen to anyone.  it wasn't too long or too short (their words). they have lent this thing to all kinds of friends.  Even was one of the women and wine night movies.,1

larger size cooked 8 hotdogs and 4 brats easily,"Convenient. These disposable grills are awesome for a quick  easy bbq.  They are perfect for ""precooked"" like hotdogs/brats.  If you want to grill something raw  chicken/beef  I find a piece of foil over the top of cooking food is helpful to focus the heat.  I love that the ""charcoal"" is all natural and no lighter fluid is necessary. I use the smaller size when it's just me. The larger size cooked 8 hotdogs and 4 brats easily (space).  I also like the sanitary aspect of using these... no grill to clean or grilling on a surface that might not be cleaned well. NOTE:  Beware of using the wire brushes on your grill - the metal brissles can be ingested and puncture your intestines - which is life threatening not to mention painful!  When using a regular grill  once the grates have cooled you can soak the grill grates in garbage sack with a little detergent. Next day  hose them off. Yeah  it's a little more of a hassle  but NO metal brissles to ingest. All in all  these disposable grills are really meant for ""lightweight"" grilling projects. I just like the additional positive aspects of using them  like the cleanliness aspect. Hope this info helps!",1

wonder if they make king size sheets,Softest Crib Sheets Ever!. These are the softest crib sheets ever! And the floral prints are just darling. They are easy care - machine wash & dry. I'm not kidding when I say these are the softest sheets ever! I wonder if they make king size sheets?!?,1
lead female character is fast thinking and fun,Very fast and fun read. I was given this book for free  and my review is voluntary. This is the first book that I have read from this author. I have fallen in love with this series! It is well written. The lead female character ( July) is fast thinking and fun. The casino resort security head is sexy ...and single until he meets July and in a very dangerous situation. Even tho this is a novella that takes place in just one night  it has so much fast action in it. As you read it you can feel the excitement in the story. Good and fun read that I would highly recommend to everyone. Can't wait to read more of this series,1
Moody Blues,Good Old Tunes!!. I’ve Loved Moody Blues for 40+ Years Finally Bought an album,1
easy to install,For the cost it's nice  but not enough for me. Bought for my 2021 Silverado Z71. It was easy to install and worked well enough. It looks like a $150 cover though. I just couldn't put it on such a nice truck and feel okay about it. I ended up with something much higher quality. If you want an easy cheap cover though  this is a good choice.,1
fit thru the body,Does the job intended with style... For a price point under $20- this is a top that can actually do its job and provide ample coverage as a base layer.. But  the shirt is multifaceted and can also be used as a light pullover to lend a layer of protection from the sun..  if going casual- this even has the ability to stand alone on its own!  Material feels nice and soft with a small stretchable quality.. although a synthetic  this has a breathable lightness to it. Seams are stitched straight and on point- no loose threads. Ordered in light gray it has a small dime size “logo” imprinted on the chest (ours is in the same color as the shirt..) almost unnoticeable except for it’s silver sheen. Both the length in sleeve and torso- are comparable to U.S. sizing chart. A nice solid fit thru the body which is helped in part by the elastin stretch the fabric provides- it eliminates the appearance of a square boxier cut + feel for those with slender builds.. and yet  this has room to fit and forgive a bit without looking seer-sucking! (I included photos of fabric of close  logo  seams + shirts cut.. in case it helps!?)  For reference: My son is- 6’4”  187lb  33x36  active but  not super athletic build..18yr. caught between a man/boy body! This shirt nicely drapes his silhouette vs. hangs on his body type. *Note: neck opening is a tad wider at the shoulder points which is different then usual round opening (in womens style this is referenced as a “boat neck” Im not sure if it was just us who noticed this anomaly.. but  something to take notice of. Not a deal breaker just creates a slightly different finished look.  For an unknown brand this has the quality and ability to do its job at a solid price. An item that can find its way into your wardrobe in 3 if not all 4 seasons and has the quality to hold up as long. Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe!,1
hair is dry and brittle,Like magic!. I don't know what I did without this brush before. I have naturally dark hair that I have colored blonde so my hair is dry  brittle and tangles very easily. Before I had to use nearly an entire bottle of conditioner just to make my hair manageable post shower. Now I barely use any conditioner. I use a detangling / leave-in conditioner spray (Unite 7 Seconds is awesome by the way) and then I brush through with this brush and it goes through without ripping out my hair and getting stuck. It's not fancy  and arrived with the black logo on the back nearly scratched off but who cares - it works.,0

The Very Thought Of You,Britain does it again!. What started out as a uniquely American genre  that of blues  soul  and gospel  has somehow managed to become the creative property of Britain ... ever since the decline of classic Motown  Britain has been churning out an amazingly talented bunch of blue-eyed soul singers and blues musicians. One of the more recent additions is James Hunter  who first burst onto the scene under the stage name Howlin' Wilf in the 1980s ([[ASIN:B000HOJNI4 Cry Wilf!]]). His several solo recordings are strongly influenced by R&B  early rock and roll  and soul. His 1994 debut Believe What I Say includes guest performances by Van Morrison (Hunter also appeared on several of Van's albums during the '90s and was part of Morrison's Rhythm & Blues Revue).  Believe What I Say opens with the jivin' Two Can Play  with its sassy staccato sax riffs punctuating this tale of infidelity. Hunter's smooth  sensual update of torch song The Very Thought Of You comes off as more late-night smoky jazz  with a delivery that Ray Charles would be proud of. Turn On Your Love Light features a smokin' duet with Van Morrison.  One of the few covers is Ray Charles' Hallelujah I Love Her So. Compared to Charles' original  which leaned towards Big Band brassy  Hunter's backing saxes sound the same on every track  and I felt the instrumentals lacking punch in the first half  but the bridge (with guitar) redeems the song and gospel feeling creeps in toward the finale.  Out of Sight is a tight soul ditty that pays homage to James Brown with its knockout brass/drum punches. Hear Me Calling has some hand-waving gospel vibes going  complete with call-and-response chorus.  The majority of the songs sound like they could have come off the radio from the mid-'50s to late '60s. They're pleasant enough  but the sameness of the backing detracts from the potential to differentiate between tracks. Hunter's writing chops create songs that feel authentically retro. His singing voice combines elements of Ray Charles and Sam Cooke  and his guitar shows heavy influence from Chuck Berry and legendary blues guitarists such as B.B. King.  Hunter has continued to polish his sound on his subsequent solo releases [[ASIN:B0000259AM Kick It Around]] and [[ASIN:B000E1NX1S People Gonna Talk]]  but it's enjoyable to hear his first solo work after his turn with Howlin' Wilf and the Vee-Jays. He's one of the most authentic of the current crop of blue-eyed soul artists  and really inhabits that long-lost R&B/soul/blues era as if it were only yesterday instead of decades ago.,1
cute earrings for under $16,Two-toned delight!. These two toned faux hammered earrings are delightful. These are turquoise (smooth) and copper colored (hammered). They are hand-painted/handmade. The posts are stainless steel and nickel free. I have sensitive skin and didn’t notice any irritation or redness. While the packaging is simple  I did like that it included a “thank you” label on the box. These earrings are very classy and can be worn everyday. Overall  these are some cute earrings for under $16.,1
transport you away,Transports You Away to a Caribbean Island. This is my first Bertie Higgins album  so I can't compare it to his others.  Until this album I only knew him from his mega-hit Key Largo.  It's a great song  but played so much on the radio that I almost got sick of it.  Unfortunately not many of his other songs got as much radio play and that's a shame.  Bertie has a rich clear voice and lot of great songs that transport you away to the islands or to south Florida.  Comparisons to Jimmy Buffet are probably inevitable  since they both seem to sing about layed-back liesure or island living.  Jimmy's fans are known as parrotheads and Bertie's are boneheads.  You might think he copied Buffet and just changed a few things.  Perhaps he did to some extent (Buffet was one of his inspirations)  but I think that Higgins is a much better singer than Buffet  as much as I like Jimmy Buffet.  Sure  the pirate theme seems something contrived and gimmicky and perhaps gets a little silly at times  but it doesn't detract from the fine quality of the songs.  There are a lot of songs here it's a good collection of Bertie's best  I think.  One of the traps that a themed based singer can fall into is having all his songs sound alike.  Each of Bertie's songs sound different.  He also doesn't have one those voices where every song sounds the same  which you find more so with Buffet and various other singers.  There is enough variety in his delivery and the sound of his voice to make this interesting and enjoyable not the same song over and over again.  The themes of most of the songs may be the same  but the variety is still there and that's quite a difficult thing to achieve.,1
great multivitamin,Great multivitamin  everything my grandson needs in a terrifc tasting gummy!. My 6 year old grandson loves taking his vitamins this way! Not only are they dinosaur designed on the outside  but the gummies are as well. I love that they contain most of the vitamins and supplements that he needs for his growing body in an easy to take gummy. Of course  with any gummies like this you need to keep them out of the little one's reach as I know mine would eat more of them if I didn't control them. Outside of that  it's a great way to keep his health optimal and I don't need to wrestle with him to take it  lol. Great idea  great multivitamin!,1
good sound,nice song. we got this for a cheap  surprised us how good they sounded. impressed enough to get other ones too. good buy,1
solid box,Was wary  but am impressed. Recently moved and didn’t want to give Home Depot my business when buying a wardrobe box. I was a little wary not knowing the brand but this was a solid box and got the job more than done. Would buy again.,1
easier for her to handle,Perfect for the senior in your life!. I love this pill holder. I got it for my mom who is in her 90's now and I am so glad I did. It is a larger size  allows me to put out her medication by am/pm and the dates are very large and easy for her to read. The compartments open easily and I find it so much easier for her to handle being sure she gets all the medicine she needs and the time she needs it. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a great pill organizer!,1
cute wall plaque,This is a cute wall plaque. My 16 year .... This is a cute wall plaque. My 16 year old loves it.  It's well made and of course  has a &#34cool&#34 saying.  Cute decoration for a girl's room.,1
as expected,Five Stars. Finally! Correct size. As expected.,1
"""Nice pencil""","Nice pencil. Im not sure what they mean by "" retracktable"" because once the lead point comes out you cant make it go back in. There are a nice variety of colors in the box. I like how each pencil has 3 more leads stored inside itself. The gripper feels good in my hand and is easy to write with. As with any pencil like this  you cant press down too hard as you write because the lead will break.",1
ordered for her,Better Than Using a Paper Plate!. My daughter enjoys painting in her free time. She uses acrylic paint that comes in little tubes and likes to blend her own colors. I ordered this for her because she was using a paper plate for her paints and this looked like it would be easier to use. It also keeps the paints separate and not touching accidently. It cleans up pretty easily  too.,1
fun,Fun to play. Kind of addicting. Fun,1
mediums,"Runs Small. My daughter is 5'7"" and weighs about 150 pounds. She usually wears leggings in mediums  but I was unsure about this pair and ordered a large. The large fits her very well. They are not loose or baggy at all. I don't think she would have been able to fit in mediums. The blue/gray color is really cute. She enjoys wearing these.",1
full and trial sizes,Full & trial sizes premium beauty products. I like this subscription box because it offers full sized skin care and make up products and they are premium beauty products. However  I do not like the fact that the box does not offer very many products it only offers like five or six and I feel like it’s over priced. I suggest the ipsy subscription that offers make up skin care and products for your body and they come in full and trial sizes and that has been a great subscription box for me.,1
color stunning,Beautiful Quality Pearl  But A Little Smaller Than Same Size Class From Same Company. I have always wanted to have a pearl necklace.  Although it is not my usual style  I thought I would try one out.  The problem is that I did not have any earrings appropriate to wear with it.  That is where these came in.  HOW THESE ARE PACKAGED This is a beautiful set very appropriate for gift giving.  It comes in a cardboard sheath.  Inside there is a very beautiful blue box with a nice expensive looking finish on it.  Inside the box there is a plastic bag with a pair of earrings  silicone backs on them  extra backs  a white velvet bag  and a cleaning cloth.  QUALITY The earring pearls are beautiful in tone and quality.  They are shiny as you can see from the photo.  The camera reflection is showing on the pearl.  The tone of the pearl is what I call a rose taupe tint to it.  It is very slight  but it is warm and beautiful.  SIZE The size of these is not quite as big as I hoped it would be.  My necklace is from the same company and the color matches perfectly   but the size although listed as the same is bigger on the necklace.  Nevertheless  it looks good together and I am happy with it.  THE BOTTOM LINE This set of earrings is really nice.  It is good quality  well packaged  and a decent price.  MY RATING FIVE STARS.  Although I wish they were just a tiny bit larger  I still like them very much and the color is stunning.,1
cute,so cute. easy to connect works great,1
easy,easy. like how  easy it was,1
Good,Magnetic. Good,1
Good basketball pump,Good basketball pump. Good pump and got it at a great price. It does the job and pumps up balls.  The needle conveniently stores in the handle which is great. It also comes with an attachment to blow balloons up too!,1
lasted 3 months,Not Happy. this product lasted 3 months and died  i had to buy a new computer  this part was hard to find - contacted seller he/she never responded - dont bother wasting your money  buy a new computer !!,0
belt is long enough to wrap around twice,"Ring the Alarm!!!. Someone should call the cops because looking this good should be a crime. This jumpsuit is oh-so-glam! I honestly can't believe how great it looks for the price. The fabric is a lightweight chiffon-like fabric with a hint of stretch. As a woman with rippled thighs  I was concerned about the combination of a light color and a thin fabric. No worries!! There's no show-through even though the pants are unlined. If you're a larger cup size  you'll probably need to wear a tube top or bandeau under this for more coverage. I'm not judging if you want to show off your goodies. The belt is long enough to wrap around twice. I did this for extra cinching. The color I chose is more of a sage green than a true mint. Pay close attention to the size chart. I found it to be very accurate. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the X-Large.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
superb,love them. Superb never a hassle always easy to use great gift,1
Wattage said it should be compatible,fancy keyboard. It's not too bad. I'm used to playing on a piano though  so the keyboard is a little tough. It's hard to control sound with these keys compared to what I'm used to. I'll only be using this until I can afford to get my piano shipped to me.  There's more stuff on this keyboard than I'll probably ever use. All different sorts of things you can use like splitting and layering  recording  playing songs so you can play along with them  a million different kinds of instruments. It's pretty crazy.  The headphones are alright. They don't block out noise that's going on around you though at all  which I sort of expected from the look of them.  The power supply cord was damaged when it came  so my husband has written to amazon a week or two ago about it and they just got back to him today. His problem is in the middle of being processed or something  so we'll see if they just send us another or if we have to send it back to them (hopefully not). I've been using a different power cord that we had left over from an internet router box or something like that. The wattage on it said it should be compatible and it hasn't killed it yet. I got this keyboard for Christmas and it would've sucked if I couldn't use it until a few weeks from now whenever Amazon resolves our problem.  The sustain pedal isn't that great. It doesn't sustain very well at all. And it never stays in place. It constantly moves back across the floor as you're trying to press your foot on it. I tried putting no-slip rubbery mat stuff on the bottom of it but it didn't work. Maybe if you have carpet it won't move around on you  but even for that I'm doubtful. I haven't figured out how to anchor it into place yet.,0
works great,Best pet carrier in the market today!. I have always used hard-sided carriers for my cat which tend to be bulky and difficult to store. I really was interested in trying a soft-sided one and I am glad I did! This is light weight and foldable so if you need to store it you can easily. Quality made  it assembles easily and has zippers that move smoothly and do not snag. My cat is eleven pounds and I got the larger size to give her a little more room and it works great for her. I highly recommend this soft sided pet carrier.,1
roots need to breath,orchid potting. Lots of shredded bark - which is best for orchids - their roots need to breath.  This is a super big bag. So if you have a 1 or 2 orchids to pot or repot - you might want to get the much smaller bag.,1
goes on purple,Dries Clear. I work in a special education classroom and we use glue sticks regularly with our class work. I compared this extra strength glue stick to our regular ones. It's a larger tube than the others  but I really didn't notice any difference in the glue capabilities. It's a good glue stick. It goes on purple and dries clear. It will probably remain my go-to glue stick brand.,1
favorite candy,My very favorite candy by far. My very favorite candy by far. Buying it online is not only convenient  it saves me about 50% over local stores.,1
thin sweatshirt feel,Runs a Little Small. This sweatshirt runs a little small through the width. It is a slicker  polyester material. It is very comfortable. The inside is like a thin sweatshirt feel. Size up if you want it to fit comfortably. The colors are nice and the toddler doesn’t look weird.,1
battery lasts longer,Longer battery charge. My battery lasts longer but my phone is much heavier.,1
variety of lights patterns and speeds,Super projecting lights for all party uses! Amazingly good!. This is a super cool product. I live in a new 'cool' 55 and older community in the Daytona Beach area and we have parties at neighbor homes several times a week. When I first set these up I wasn't sure what to expect. But after seeing the  variety of lights  patterns and speeds I knew this would be a hit. We had a Motown party last weekend and this projector was the highlight of the night! Great colors  great remote control capability and even responds to voice commands. This would be a great addition to any home (young or old) for use when there is a party to be had. I definitely highly recommend this gadget for all ages and holidays!,1
gift card is convenient to pay at Logan,Logan's food is cheaper than Outback and tastes better than Applebee. The gift card is convenient to pay at Logan and especially a 20% discount on prime day. Logan's food is cheaper than Outback and tastes better than Applebee.,1
Very sturdy,Fantastic!. Got the legs on to my low slung couch.  Went on very nicely.  So nice to have a little more height.  Good product all wood which was important.  Very sturdy,1
countries,Interesting look at different countries. Hard to get friends to play,1
open car,little bit of rock  a little bit of country and a little bit of rap. it is funny  how within one song you can get a real mix of composition!  for a new comer  she has a great voice and like a review before  she definately has a bit of carrie underwood  a bit of pussycat  and a little bit of Wyonna too.  The lyrics are definately more country orientated.  Strong voice  great music beat and many of the songs  I couldnt help tapping my feet and I am going to incorporate many of songs in my personal spinning exercise program.  Definately a good album to play in an open car!,1
holds a LOT of toys,collapsible toy chest. The toy chest is exactly as represented and their measurements are accurate.  Holds a LOT of toys.  I had grandsons toys in a basket.. that soon was overflowing into the room.. so this keeps things neat and tidy in my tiny house.  The side handles help to move it about and it does fold down to about 1 1/2&#34...  But it probably will never be folded again.  Too many toys.,1
5-minute recipes,Quick and easy vegetarian recipes that are heavy on processed products. I became vegetarian during grad school. Living in the dorm  I didn't have direct access to a kitchen  either. This necessitated frequent trips to the local co-op / organic store. Student's Vegetarian Cookbook for Dummies is perfect for this scenario: busy student  not much time (or space) to cook. Many of the included recipes take five or less minutes to throw together.  The first 85 pages or so are dedicated to understanding reasons for a vegetarian diet  living the vegetarian lifestyle  and basic cooking methods and tools. If you have a basic knowledge of cooking  that is more than enough  since most of time these recipes simply involve unwrapping and microwaving. The instructions were so simple that this would be an appropriate book for teens (it's literally things like how to assemble a sandwich or veggie burger). I was also put off by the fact that so many of the ingredients are heavily processed (soy meats  vegetarian gravy  Pasta Roni seasoning packets).  The biggest issue for me was that so little of the included recipes sounded remotely appetizing. There is nutritional info provided many of the suppers relied extensively on potatoes and pasta and had calorie and fat counts that were rather high (600+ calories for the smothered potatoes  538 calories for the Athena's Potatoes  646 calories and 39 g fat for the Blue Cheese Fettuccine). That's not to say that healthier vegetarian options aren't present many of the five-minute lunches have much lower calorie counts and rely on whole grains  veggies  cottage cheese  hummus  and beans  but if you ate the included supper ideas on a regular basis  it could easily pack on the weight.  Overall  this would be a good first book for those who are new to the kitchen the included recipes are so simple that you'll want to move to something a little more challenging  like [[ASIN:0767927478 Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone]] or [[ASIN:0764524836 How to Cook Everything Vegetarian: Simple Meatless Recipes for Great Food]]. Personally  I prefer [[ASIN:1557884382 The PDQ (Pretty Darn Quick) Vegetarian Cookbook: 240 Healthy and Easy No-Prep Recipes for Busy Cooks]] and [[ASIN:0399535616 Supermarket Vegan: 225 Meat-Free  Egg-Free  Dairy-Free Recipes for Real People in the Real World]] as my go-to for quick  simple  and satisfying vegetarian / vegan food.,1
well constructed strong,QUALITY CONSTRUCTED. Fantastic! Back Pac. Color Is Beautiful. Lots of deep pockets w/ easy access. Bag is really holding up extremely well for the amount of use it gets. I Recommend 5 ***** This Back Pac. Awesome! Well Constructed Strong. Longevity.,1
teeth are cleaner than using one or the other,Great concept  needs some improvements. The jury is still out on how much I like this toothbrush (which is why I am rating it 4 stars). As positives  I love the fact that it attempts to combine an electric toothbrush and flosser in one. I know that it does a decent job at both  but not as well as my sonicare brush and standalone Waterpik flosser. My teeth are cleaner than using one or the other  but not if I used my standalones together. I think they need to do a little more research and upgrade this at the next release (particularly with the power of the brush and the water flow) and then they may be on to a wonderful gadget to improve oral health.,1
two toned faux hammered earrings,Two-toned delight!. These two toned faux hammered earrings are delightful. These are turquoise (smooth) and copper colored (hammered). They are hand-painted/handmade. The posts are stainless steel and nickel free. I have sensitive skin and didn’t notice any irritation or redness. While the packaging is simple  I did like that it included a “thank you” label on the box. These earrings are very classy and can be worn everyday. Overall  these are some cute earrings for under $16.,1
vintage-inspired snowball pompom ornaments,"Retro-inspired country Christmas is a walk down memory lane.... ""The Farm Chicks Christmas"" by Serena Thompson is the follow-up to 2009's [[ASIN:1588168662 The Farm Chicks in the Kitchen: Live Well  Laugh Often  Cook Much]]. The first Farm Chicks book was a countrified cookbook peppered liberally with stories and reminiscences by Serena and Teri  antiques-inspired craft ideas (a reusable stencil was included in the front)  and comfort food: easy recipes for breakfast treats  appetizers  soups and salads  and decadent desserts  over fifty in all.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas "" on the other hand  is written only by Serena  a contributing editor for Country Living magazine and antiques show hostess (her best friend Teri has retired from their business). The book still includes numerous country-inspired craft ideas you'll find decorative  retro-inspired self-adhesive gift tags and notecards at the back  along with various decorating ideas for ""the most wonderful time of the year."" However  the ratio of crafts to recipes is reversed from the first book there are only 17 recipes included at the back with gift-giving suggestions on how to package them.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" captures the magic of childhood Christmases  from family visits to the tree farm (complete with recipe ideas for hot drinks to tote along)  holiday decorating ideas (holiday scalloped bunting  vintage-inspired snowball pompom ornaments  cone trees and vintage funnel trees  banners and more)  and photos of Serena's friends' and family's homes decorated for Christmas.  Much of the book is more like a scrapbooked photo essay  with crafts sprinkled in every few pages. Also  the decorating tips (and included photos) are vintage country in the Farm Chicks fashion: displaying old farm toys standing in coconut snow  for example  or stacking metal funnels to make ""trees."" If you're not a fan of all things country  this probably isn't the holiday book for you.  The included holiday recipes are few  and aimed mostly at gift-giving  like the sweet and salty nuts  mini orange bundt cakes  and various types of cookies (butter cutouts  chocolate-covered peanut butter balls  snowballs  Spritz cookies). As with the previous book  a handy list of metric equivalent charts is provided at the back. I tried the sweet and salty nuts recipe first  and though tasty  I didn't think that the ""sweet"" flavor predominated it was more of a subtle afterthought (there's only 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of honey for 3 cups of nuts).  Overall  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" is a nostalgic walk down a snowy memory lane  but it has narrower mass appeal than ""Farm Chicks in the Kitchen"" due to the reversal of the recipe-to-crafts ratio and the genre-specific decorating style (I enjoyed the many beautiful photographs  but won't find myself making yarn-ball wreaths or filling jars with spare Christmas lightbulbs anytime soon).

dense mask smells good,dense mask  smells good  great ingredients my tin is dented/no protective seal. My tin is dented.  It just arrived in a warehouse mailing bag. There was no protective tape  tamper sticker  or cover  or product box... so I am not sure what this product has been through before arriving to me. Ew. I know products are sold by weight not volume  but the container really does look like it is missing a portion  as it is half empty. It is probably all there. The container looks to be a 2 ounce capacity  with 1.7 ounces of product. The product is dense  so after settling  I imagine this is accurate. But still.. between the dented can and the lack of protective seal  I am reticent to use in on my face  and definitely won't be buying it as a gift (which I was considering as I ordered this for me  and figured if i liked it then I would buy it as part of a pampering gift).  Too bad because the container otherwise is attractive  the product smells good  and the ingredients are interesting highly nourishing & repairing for the skin. I love self care products  and doing an occasional mask is relaxing.  1.7 ounces has 3.4 tablespoons. Probably use half a table spoon to cover face. So maybe 7-8 full face applications? I guess price it out like a sheet mask. $3.75 per treatment if assuming 8 applications. More or less depending on how much you use.  I hope the company considers adding a seal or tamper sticker.,1
phone feels protected,10/10 recommend. Love how great these work and my phone always feels so protected! Great buy especially for the price!,1
enough cushion to protect the laptop,This fits my husband's macbook very well. It's a .... This fits my husband's macbook very well. It's a snug and safe feeling fit.  It has enough cushion to protect the laptop.  It also has pockets on the outside to hold the charger and other small items.  Well made.,1
Yum!,Delicious!!! Yum!. Excellent!  The best!  I use it with my beef and broccoli and to throw in chicken and rice soup. It’s also great by itself. Yum!,1
heats the water,Great value. A great little cleaner that actually heats the water.  I wish it would run for 15 minutes at a time instead of 5  but the unit would probably overheat.,1
local stores only carry them seasonally,As advertised.. Husband bought for greenhouse and reports they work great and as expected.  They are one of those things you need extras of apparently and the local stores only carry them seasonally.  So Amazon to the rescue!,0
looks like a $150 cover,For the cost it's nice  but not enough for me. Bought for my 2021 Silverado Z71. It was easy to install and worked well enough. It looks like a $150 cover though. I just couldn't put it on such a nice truck and feel okay about it. I ended up with something much higher quality. If you want an easy cheap cover though  this is a good choice.,0
Fits great in a tight space,Great little shelf!. Fits great in a tight space... not sure how much weight it can actually hold  but it's great for towels and bath accessories!!,1
Ray Charles,Britain does it again!. What started out as a uniquely American genre  that of blues  soul  and gospel  has somehow managed to become the creative property of Britain ... ever since the decline of classic Motown  Britain has been churning out an amazingly talented bunch of blue-eyed soul singers and blues musicians. One of the more recent additions is James Hunter  who first burst onto the scene under the stage name Howlin' Wilf in the 1980s ([[ASIN:B000HOJNI4 Cry Wilf!]]). His several solo recordings are strongly influenced by R&B  early rock and roll  and soul. His 1994 debut Believe What I Say includes guest performances by Van Morrison (Hunter also appeared on several of Van's albums during the '90s and was part of Morrison's Rhythm & Blues Revue).  Believe What I Say opens with the jivin' Two Can Play  with its sassy staccato sax riffs punctuating this tale of infidelity. Hunter's smooth  sensual update of torch song The Very Thought Of You comes off as more late-night smoky jazz  with a delivery that Ray Charles would be proud of. Turn On Your Love Light features a smokin' duet with Van Morrison.  One of the few covers is Ray Charles' Hallelujah I Love Her So. Compared to Charles' original  which leaned towards Big Band brassy  Hunter's backing saxes sound the same on every track  and I felt the instrumentals lacking punch in the first half  but the bridge (with guitar) redeems the song and gospel feeling creeps in toward the finale.  Out of Sight is a tight soul ditty that pays homage to James Brown with its knockout brass/drum punches. Hear Me Calling has some hand-waving gospel vibes going  complete with call-and-response chorus.  The majority of the songs sound like they could have come off the radio from the mid-'50s to late '60s. They're pleasant enough  but the sameness of the backing detracts from the potential to differentiate between tracks. Hunter's writing chops create songs that feel authentically retro. His singing voice combines elements of Ray Charles and Sam Cooke  and his guitar shows heavy influence from Chuck Berry and legendary blues guitarists such as B.B. King.  Hunter has continued to polish his sound on his subsequent solo releases [[ASIN:B0000259AM Kick It Around]] and [[ASIN:B000E1NX1S People Gonna Talk]]  but it's enjoyable to hear his first solo work after his turn with Howlin' Wilf and the Vee-Jays. He's one of the most authentic of the current crop of blue-eyed soul artists  and really inhabits that long-lost R&B/soul/blues era as if it were only yesterday instead of decades ago.,1
collection of sparkly shapes,Great collection of sparkly shapes  sequins and shiny bits.. They come in a convenient container for crafting.,1
pre order the books,Great as usual.. I have read every book in the Sisterhood series. They are all great. I always pre order the books and have never been disappointed. I can't wait until the next one comes out.,1
main pockets are far too shallow,Very thick for nylon pants. Was expecting these to be the typical thin nylon zip off pants like Columbia or REI sells.  I was wrong. These are MUCH thicker.  Fitment seems true to size.  Initial impression is craftsmanship is good (no hanging strings  seams were all straight  etc).  ONly negative is that the main pockets are far too shallow to safely store items during any activity.  If one were to sit down with a knife in those pockets it would fall out in short order and risk loss. The zipper pocket on the right side is VERY deep.  The main pockets should have followed that pattern to be useful.,1
following the life of a photographer who seems to be hallucinating,A Mish-Mash of Nonsense. I have never seen such a bizarre movie.  It is a conglomeration of talking heads speaking about things that make no sense at all.  It's new age gobbledygook.  The movie made no sense whatsoever and I had no idea what they were getting at or talking about 99% of the time.  The movie drifts between following the life of a photographer who seems to be hallucinating and interviews with people talking absurdly about quantum physics and quantum mechanics and what is real and what isn't.  Near as I can tell the point of the movie seemed to be to try and convince us that reality is created by the chemicals in our brains.  There are lots of colorful journeys though the brain and body too that look very psychedelic.  I have never taken hallucinogens  but I imagine that they could produce something like this movie.  It's a crazy mixed-up mess.  Parts were entertaining  but overall it was total and complete goofiness.,0
colorful,Fit deep twin xl  nicely. Soft  warm  colorful  fit an extra deep twin xl  nicely! Would buy again. Keep in mind they are microfiber not traditional cotton sheets.,1
loved it,Dog loved it.. Held together longer that expected.  Dog loved it.,1
zipper,100% cotton! Yay!!!!!. This duvet set is a serious bubble gum girly pink.  After raising 5 kids and 25 years of marriage I am single and have seriously declared independence in my bedroom that is going seriously pastel! LOL.  The only problem with that is 2 small dogs who like to run in my muddy garden  but the cotton washes great and gets softer with every washing which is the thing I love most about cotton.  I love that this duvet has a zipper too!  The only drawback I’ve found and that will be super easy for me to fix since I sew is that the ties inside are made of a very cheap fabric in my opinion. They came a bit frayed  but next time I am at the local Joann’s Fabric store I will pick up some twill tape or other material to replace the ties. The big irony is that I currently have a mint colored comforter inside of the duvet as I recently moved and have not unpacked my duvet insert yet.  I also like the little girly ruffle that is on 3 sides of the comforter.  Yes  I am a 52 year old woman with a bubble gum pink duvet cover and I’m loving it!,1
extending base to the mouse,A Lot of Mouse. I have never used a gaming mouse before. Actually I've looked down on people who did for the same reason I don't like some players being on steroids in major league sports. But now that I'm getting older  my reactions are slower  my fingers are not as quick on the keys and...Oh...I guess I like it for exactly the same reasons athletes love steroids...  But on a serious note.  Mousing and key gnashing do take a toll. I don't know that this mouse is a complete solution to it. But I have had relief of being able to have some things macroed to a single mouse button.  If nothing else  it has created a different movement.  I like the quality of the mouse.  The tracking is very good  the feel is okay  the looks are richly industrial.  I'm not huge on the extending base to the mouse.  I just wish it had been a little bigger to fit my hand  but it fits fine without extending. Personally  a little heavier would feel a little better as well.  All in all I'm very impressed  and wished I had given into &#34juicing&#34 my game a long time ago.,0
consistency,Not bad  prefer Tums. I rated this as 3 stars. Taste was good  not crazy about the consistency. Maybe I am just used to the consistency (chalky) of Tums. These seemed a little chewier  These are also way over priced for what I consider almost a no-name brand. I would prefer to get the generic at CVS for a lot less.,0
good flavor,Good beef jerky  excellent lightly spiced  perfect for snacking. Great not-overly-spicy beef jerky. Perfect size for packing in my lunch bag for a mid afternoon snack. This is definitely one of my favorites. I did deduct a star because even though the flavor was great  I did find this pack a little on the dry side. I am going to order another package before month end and if I find the next package to be better  I will be adding to this review and changing it to a 5 star. My brother and nephew really love this jerky  too  and have been eating it for years  so I know it's got to be good!,1
quality made,Great for the developing musical protegy in your home!. I love this Melissa & Doug Upright Piano. Beautiful colors  quality made  bigger than I expected and an amazing sound from what is considered a children's toy. My grandson who is three absolutely adores this (he even likes when I make a melody out of playing Chopsticks  lol). I can see where in another year he will be able to play little tunes on it. For now  he loves experimenting with the sounds  going from low to high and back again. I come from a musical family and I have always prided myself on introducing my own children (and now my grandchildren) to the wonderful world of music. This Melissa & Doug Upright Piano is the perfect way to start a toddler learning to love music at an early age. This would make a wonderful Christmas gift under the tree this year for the future virtuoso in your family!,1
easy to make,Very easy to make. Very easy to make  my dogs loved this as a special birthday treat (we put a scoop inside a turkey bacon bowl I made) Just add water  stir and freeze. I like that it doesn't contain a lot of junk  its limited ingredient.,1
fits her perfectly,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
clumsy arthritic hands,awesome if you use insulin you need this. i didnt receive this yet but i have one and its awesome  i use it for my cat's insulin and with my clumsy arthritic hands i cant tell you how many times this thing saved the bottle from smashing a very expensive bottle of medication i might add  if you use insulin you should get this  they have various sizes too  for the taller bottles and the bigger bottles  but this is the size for the cats bottle  ive had one since 2016 and its just gotten yucky and accidentally in the fridge some italian dressing spilled on it  and i cant stand looking at it like that  so i ordered a new one,1
liquid could get through,French Press works better. I was so excited to use this for cold brew since I love so many OXO products  but this was a disappointment. I’ve been making cold brew in a French press until now  and I have been pleased with the results  but since it requires hands on filtering  I thought this OXO system would simplify the filtering and allow the machine to do most of the work. Wrong. With a French Press  once the coffee has brewed  I can press the coffee and separate most of the grounds from the cold brew. Then I slowly pour it out into a mesh filter lined with a paper filter and wait for it to slowly seep through. I have to change the paper filter half way through before pouring the second half. With this OXO system  you are supposed to be able to flip the switch and the cold brew will drip down in to the glass carafe below. But the grounds kept clogging the filter and then absolutely no liquid could get through. (I will also note that I have a quality conical burr grinder  so the grind should not be an issue.) I had to stand over it for about 15 min scraping the grounds to the side or scooping spoonfuls of grounds out of the brewing container. After 15 minutes of this  we were left with roughly 2/3 of the volume of cold brew we would have gotten from the same recipe in a French press. The reduced volume was partially due to me scooping grounds out of the way and throwing them in the sink  and partially because there was no way to effectively press the liquid out of the grounds. Also the taste was inferior. Again probably because the most concentrated cold brew couldn’t be pressed out of the grounds. Overall the taste was nowhere as good and the process was more cumbersome than a French press. I wish I loved this machine  but on the plus side  it’s one less thing to sit on my counter and take up more space in the fridge.,0
feet and legs always ache,So cute and stylish!. As a CNA  my feet and legs always ache to the point where I can't walk after a shift. That completely changed after I started wearing these! I am able to actually keep up! I wear these on the airplane  when my legs ache or when I have a POTS flare. I get so many complements on these and would totally recommend!,0
book club discussion,A great summer read with lots of themes. A great summer read with lots of themes. Perfect for a book club discussion,1
useful gadget,Read The Instructions Carefully. I remember reading about the Kickstarter campaign for this product. I'm glad to see it worked out. This is a very useful gadget. You can use it to clean pretty much anything that fits into the canister. That includes dentures  retainers  toothbrush heads  facial brushes  and jewelry. There's a bit of a learning curve in its use. Make sure to read the instructions carefully before you try to use it. If you want an easy and efficient way to clean your products  I HIGHLY recommend this gadget.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1
hood ties are already fraying apart at the knotted ends,Yikes. What you see is definitely not what you get.. Terrible  Low Quality material. Would have returned it but I already washed it. Material is much thinner than it appears in photo and would probably only keep you warm if you sat in a sauna. The photo material looks like a thick polyester material you would HOPE is inner lined with fleece. Keep dreaming.  The outer material is actually a cheap cotton tee shirt-like material with an abrasive texture on inside that mimics sweats but not quite.  After two washings  the hood ties are already fraying apart at the knotted ends and have almost completely faded  even while using Cheer color guard. They definitely overpriced this product for the quality you receive. Don't bother.,0
Buyer beware!,They don't stick. I got them today. They are so cute. But they are stuck to the paper. Then when you get them off. Its just a picture. I need them. So I will glue them. Buyer beware!,0
sugar scrub,this smells weird. I love this brand of sugar scrub but this is the first time I tried the lemon and its weird. it also was shipped and left out in the heat causing the package to leak so maybe that was the issue.,1

I travel quite often to European countries and this adapter will work in every country I will be visiting.

political protest,"A lovely tale of matchmaking  true love and modern India. Hyder Ali  a retired clerk  is driving his patient wife crazy with his post-retirement boredom. They are a Muslim couple living in Visakhapatnam (Vizag)  a coastal city in Andhra Pradesh in eastern India. His only son  Rehman  is a political activist dedicated to helping India's exploited  which gets him into trouble with the police (and his father). Mr. Ali decides to start a marriage bureau to earn extra income  and in doing so  finds unexpected happiness and reconciliation.  Mr. Ali  aided by his shrewd wife  quickly gains numerous clients seeking arranged marriages. Farahad Zama does a great job of easing Western readers into India's complicated caste system  along with its many restrictions  without departing from the story and events at hand. Some of the families insist on the unobtainable (the perfect wife: beautiful  pale complexion  English-speaking  rich  matching caste  or a software engineer husband in California)  but Mr. Ali is able to match several successfully.  The two main foci are the situation with Mr. Ali's son Rehman  who is arrested for participating in a political protest  and the unfortunate situation of Mr. Ali's young secretary Aruna  who was forced to drop out of graduate school due to her father's prolonged illness and their precarious economic situation. The narratives weave together seamlessly  along with the fruits of Mr. and Mrs. Ali's matchmaking prowess.  Indian culture is the real star here: the contrast between ancient traditions and modernity. We're given a taste of how Vizag's Christians  Muslims  and Hindus live side by side  of the intricacies of Muslim and Hindu weddings  and the sprawling Indian bureaucracy. There are numerous culinary delights  from rooh afza to idli  coconut chutney  and prasaadam. The author thoughtfully includes several cultural primers masquerading as Mrs. Ali's English ""essays"" that give the reader a background into Vizag  the caste system and Urdu and Telugu words for extended family. It reminded me of the recent excellent Vine selection [[ASIN:1416583688 The Case of the Missing Servant: A Vish Puri Mystery]]  another novel set in India that also dealt with Indian arranged marriages and Indian culture and customs.  A delightful  sparkling read that is full of moments of humor and unexpected tenderness  ""The Marriage Bureau for Rich People"" showcases both the good and bad of modern India: corruption and poverty tempered by quiet generosity and strong communities. Romantic and light without being cloying  this is a perfect summer read that fans of Indian culture will be sure to enjoy.",1
sound quality was somewhat flat and slightly muffled,"Delightful and Refreshing. Before I discovered this album  I had never heard of Annette Hanshaw and I am 59 years old.  Probably anyone under 70 or 80 wouldn't remember her that well or maybe not at all. She is just a pure joy to listen to and has such a relaxed  pleasant sounding voice.  Her voice is not powerful  but strong enough to deliver all the songs well.  It's also not the babyish sound that you get from someone like Helen Kane.  The sound quality was somewhat flat and slightly muffled  but when you consider the age of these recordings and the fact that they were undoubtedly originally recorded in monophonic  the quality is remarkable.  A couple of the songs had more noise than others  but mostly they have been well restored and one couldn't expect much better.  Just be aware you aren't going to get sharp  clear sound that you would from more modern recordings.  This is a real collector's item of great 20's music.  The habit she has of saying ""That's All!"" at the end of a number of songs was delightful to me  even after I heard it a number of times  but some might find it annoying after a few times.",0
fits well in my hand,Useful and easy to set up and clip! Has everything you need for all hair types. I was looking for a hair clipper that was versatile and could be used on adults as well as children during this pandemic. This Toovren set is just perfect. It has loads of attachments to be able to do the job professionally and quickly. Parts are easy to switch out and clean. Fits well in my hand and makes hair cutting a breeze (even when my two young grandsons are squirming on my kitchen stool  lol). Highly recommend if you are in the market for a new hairclipper.,1
helpful tips,Make showstopping desserts on your countertop with minimal effort!. I’m a fairly recent convert to the slow cooker bandwagon I only purchased my first slow cooker a couple of years ago and started out by baking my way through all the desserts in Michele Scicolone’s excellent “The Mediterranean Slow Cooker ” which introduced me to the joys of making flan  cheesecake  and fruit compote in the slow cooker.  Fast forward several years later and I was looking to expand my slow cooker desserts repertoire  so imagine my delight when I got an e-mail from Lisa Ekus that highlighted “Slow Cooker Desserts” by Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore! Roxanne and Kathy are cookbook authors  food consultants  cooking teachers and food bloggers who have written seven cookbooks and a popular blog  www.pluggedintocooking.com.  As soon as my copy of “Slow Cooker Desserts” arrived  I couldn’t wait to dig in to the many inviting recipes covering not only cakes and cheesecakes  but also bread puddings  fruits  and candy and fondues. The book opens with a good compact guide to slow cookers  bakeware  and ingredients. The layout is uncluttered and straightforward  and each recipe is followed by helpful tips  making it perfect for novice bakers. The gorgeous photography by Jennifer Davick deserves a special mention as well.  The first recipe I tried was the Praline-Pumpkin Cheesecake. I decided to substitute a gingersnap crust for the graham crackers  and it added the perfect touch of spice to complement the spices in the cheesecake filling. Note that you do need to blind bake the gingersnap crust prior to baking in the slow cooker  but this only adds a few minutes to the prep time. Also  perhaps it was the brand of gingersnaps I used  but I would recommend adding a little extra melted butter until the crust comes together – the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter for ½ cup crumbs. One thing I would suggest is to also liberally spray the sides of your springform pan as well – mine is supposedly nonstick  but I followed the recipe (which only specifies to spray the bottom of the pan) and a large portion of my cheesecake edges stuck and broke. I normally do spray the entire pan with Baker’s Joy  but I follow the recipes as written when I am testing for reviews.  The finished cheesecake texture is very fluffy and a bit crumbly  so I did have difficulty cutting it neatly I’m not sure if I may have beat TOO much air into my filling and will beat for less next time. The praline topping (made in the microwave in under three minutes) is destined to become my new secret weapon in the kitchen! This homemade caramel was delicious and deceptively easy and would also make a great addition to ice cream or cakes. All combined (gingersnap crust  spiced pumpkin filling  praline topping)  this is a great fall dessert with minimal effort and also frees up your oven for other baking tasks.  The second recipe I tried was the candied cranberry and crystallized ginger chutney this one called my name because I am a certified fiend when it comes to candied ginger. I had a bag of organic cranberries in the freezer that I was looking to use up  so it worked out perfectly that I already had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry (even the ginger liqueur!). My bag of organic cranberries was slightly smaller than the 16-oz. bag called for in the recipe  so I scaled back on the sugar quite a bit as I was using candied ginger (I used ¾ cup sugar in place of the 1 ¼ in the recipe  and it was plenty sweet for me). It also had the bonus of making my kitchen smell amazing as it cooked! I cooked mine down for a little longer the recipe says that it should be thin  but I like my chutney on the very thick side more like a compote. The recipe calls for between 5 to 7 hours on low and I ended up cooking mine for 3 hours on high due to time. This would be fantastic stirred into yogurt  as an accompaniment to Indian food  or even as a side dish in place of jellied cranberries or cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.  The third recipe was the chocolate cashew clusters. I’d seen slow cooker candy (including nut clusters) pop up in my Facebook feed  but I’d never tried making it before. The recipe uses salted cashews  semisweet and milk chocolate chips  a dark chocolate candy bar  and candy coating to create decadent nut clusters that look like they came from a candy shop. These take about 1 ½ hours on low plus cooling / set time (3 to 5 hours).  Other recipes on my to-make list from “Slow Cooker Desserts” include the cinnamon-calvados applesauce  rice pudding with cherries  and many of the cheesecakes (brownie chunk  German chocolate  ginger-peach  coconut cream) and cakes (cider-glazed apple-walnut cake  Southern sweet potato cake  pineapple butter cake). There is enough variety and possible variations (I need to find a way to make a cookie butter cheesecake!) to keep you happily baking for months to come.  (Thank you to Lisa Ekus for the review copy!),1

cool feature when the cart is closed and the wheels are folded up,This cart will absolutely exceed your expectations!. This cart exceeded my expectations by 200% even at the $169 price tag.  It is designed to work hard and not break.  It’s built like a tank  I have no doubt about the 400 lb load rating. The larger wheels easily go up/down stairs and curbs.  I expect this cart to last a very long time.  One cool feature is that when the cart is closed and the wheels are folded up  if you hold it vertically  the wheels are slightly below the platform and roll.  This comes in handy if you don’t have any cargo and you’re have limited access  you can close the cart and roll it instead of carrying it.  You won’t be disappointed with this cart!,1
worth the money,Totally worth the money and cute AF. Totally adorable and will be a gift for my 11yr old  she will love it!,1
desiccated coconut,fresh and soft. These are subtle licorice pieces. There are pieces that are predominately coconut. I like them.  My bag arrived with a distant &#34use by date&#34 and was soft and fresh. For me  I am so happy to read the ingredient list.  No red dye #40 or yellow #5 or 6.  Here is the ingredient list on the bag: Sugar  cane molasses  wheat flour  glucose syrup (contains sulphites)  desiccated coconut  palm oil  beef gelatin  corn starch  glycerol  natural colors (plain caramel  beetroot red  curcumin  paprika). fat reduced cocoa  licorice exctract  natural flavorings (aniseed  lemon  raspberry  vanilla  orange) glazing agent (beeswax) fruit and vegetable juices for coloring. Allergy alert: equipment shared with products that include peanuts  tree nuts  milk  egg  soy and wheat. NOT a health food.  But a delightful treat without harmful dyes still legal in the USA.,1
not particularly heavy,Three Stars. Doesn’t hold up my Apogee mic (not particularly heavy) well  but it’s okay.,1
convenient,Better to use on a partner than to use on yourself. I have owned several massage guns over the years to assist me with the neck and shoulder pain I have had over the years. I saw this one and wanted to try it. It is super powerful but is not the easiest to maneuver on my own (it was much easier to use on someone else than on myself).  I had a lot of difficulty holding it steady while trying to apply to my shoulder. I did try to use it on my calves and it was much better there. So  bottom line  not good for yourself if you are trying to reach areas that are not convenient (back of the neck  shoulders) but it is great for you to use on others. Just a little difficult to control.,1
Beautiful ring box,Beautiful ring box. This is a beautiful ring box that will be fantastic to propose to someone. I liked it so much  I got another. The box is wood and it is held together with a magnet. The box is just expensive looking and can be used as a ring box forever. These boxes are hand made too. Quality all around.,1
works,fabric fusion glue. Ok.  This stuff works.  IF you're gluing FABRIC to FABRIC.  Nothing else.  And NO felt.  Another note.  Use gloves or tweezers to apply.  Wash immediately if you get any on your skin.  If you have 2 layers  makes sure to put something plastic between the two layers.  I haven't tried to wash it yet  but I think it's pretty solid.  Having said all of that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
not cumbersome,The best out there in the $100 to $300 price range. It was time to upgrade from my old hoover and spend a little more to get all the features I wanted  LIKES * Using it weekly used on 4 bedrooms  office & library  porch and even the garage * Great suction * Great tool to get corners  window sills  and behind furniture * Great tool for furniture * LOVE the bagless super large cup * Simple to empty * Not cumbersome - it's not light weight but I am 50 years old and not in the best shape and I have no issues * Easy turn on off * Hepa filter - easy to install - save yourself the hassle and replace instead of cleaning * goes under most furniture,1
great tasting,Great tasting  super quick acting relief!. I love Soundhealth products and these antacid chews are some of the best. First  forgetting the fact that they are a great antacid product  quickly relieving heartburn  they are also great tasting with no chalky aftertaste (like Tums). Then  to make it even sweeter  they are even less expensive then my regular antacid I get at CVS. I am sold on these chews and will never go back to other products again!,1
fabric is lightweight,"Very Flowy. This top is very pretty and can easily be dressed up or down. The fabric is lightweight and has no stretch. If you're a larger cup size  you may need to size up.

bristles are relatively soft,PU case really smells brushes are okay two brush heads frayed. There are 14 brushes in this set. There are brushes for foundation  blush  eyeshadow  eye blending (fan brush)  etc. In fact  there are more brushes than I needed.   The one unique brush in this set (see photo) is the one that looks like a paint brush. This is perfect for cheek highlighting.  The bristles are relatively soft but not as soft as I expected. They feel pretty good against my skin but not great. Also  the heads have a slight odor. The PU brush case has a tremendous chemical odor and needs to be aired out a while.  This is a bargain basement travel set for someone who is starting their make-up journey. The current price of $11.19 comes to $.80 cents per brush. In this case one gets what they pay for it's a marginal price for a marginal quality set that is functional. ,0

gardening advice,Great magazine. I have been a long time subscriber to Living magazine  especially after I saw how much less expensive it is to purchase a subscription over purchasing the individual issues at the grocery store. The only con I can think of is that the Halloween and other specialty issues are not included with the subscription  but considering they are usually $9.99+ an issue  I guess that is to be expected. (Although I do think I would pay more for my subscription to ensure I received all Martha Living type &#34speciality&#34 issues as well  just a thought.)  I love the crafts  the recipes  and the gardening advice. Highly recommended magazine!,1
more secure grip,Ehh. Foil with soaked cotton balls accomplished the same .... Ehh.  Foil with soaked cotton balls accomplished the same and have a more secure grip.,1
brush goes through without ripping hair,Like magic!. I don't know what I did without this brush before. I have naturally dark hair that I have colored blonde so my hair is dry  brittle and tangles very easily. Before I had to use nearly an entire bottle of conditioner just to make my hair manageable post shower. Now I barely use any conditioner. I use a detangling / leave-in conditioner spray (Unite 7 Seconds is awesome by the way) and then I brush through with this brush and it goes through without ripping out my hair and getting stuck. It's not fancy  and arrived with the black logo on the back nearly scratched off but who cares - it works.,1

Red Foley,Smooth Unparalled Pop of the 40's. Some nostalgic albums reissues from the 30's  40's and 50's just don't age that well and just don't sound as well as you might remember them if you were alive in that era.  This is a wonderful exception and its sounds as fresh as it did when these songs were first popular.  Lots of artists have done Chattanooga Shoe Shine Boy  but I never cared for most of the versions this one by Red Foley is the best version I've ever heard.  I came across this album by accident  as you don't often hear Foley's name.  Strange since he had the first million seller gospel album and sold over 25 million records in his heydey and influenced many other artists.  I am sure I must have heard Foley in the 50's without knowing his name.  At that time  this was not called country or country western music.  It was cowboy music or it was just the music we listened to on the radio we didn't really classify it.  This is a nice variety of songs all the way from the sad (Old Shep) to the humorous (Don't Be Ashamed of Your Age).  There are a few really nice duets too.  The sound is sharp and Red's voice is smooth and pleasant.  If there is anything disappointing about this album it's that it doesn't go on a lot longer still with 16 songs  one can't complain too much.,1
quality I expected,Good value  good quality. Product is the quality I expected and the value is very good.,1
works exactly as it should,Adjustable tap socket. My husband needed this on his job site and so  with Amazon  I was able to send to him.  He reports tap socket works exactly as it should.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1

atmospheric,"If I could give it twenty stars instead of five I would!. I finally got around to reading ""On a Falling Tide"" by the uber-talented Georgia Hill as it had been in my to-read pile for far too long and wow what a book! A haunting and original page-turner  this book had me hooked from start to finish. I love historical fiction and none more so than when it has a touch of the supernatural and a gothic romance feel to it. I have read many time-lapse books that other reviewers have called atmospheric but ""On a Falling Tide"" really takes that word to a whole new level! There is love  loss  and of course as with any great haunting read  plenty of madness  which I assure you as a reader  you will feel too. The characters of Charity  Matt  and Lydia are so well written that they are almost tangible  as is the wonderful fictional town of Beaumouth which is set on the very real and beautiful Jurrasic Coast in England (where I was lucky enough to be born and grow up next to). I just cannot say enough good things about this book and if I could give it twenty stars instead of five on Goodreads I would! I cannot wait to see what else Georgia has up her talented sleeve.",1
flood of sugar,Sugar and spice and everything nice!. Samantha Seneviratne’s “The New Sugar and Spice” takes classic comfort bakes like cinnamon rolls  cookies  breads and cheesecake and reinvents them  using seductive hits of spice in creative and crowd-pleasing ways. In the introduction  the author points out that “the flood of sugar has diluted real flavor  muffled complexity  and concealed true richness ” so her goal was to create delicious  healthier desserts that use spices in a starring role in place of the overwhelming sweetness so prevalent in many desserts.  Chapters are divided by spices (sometimes with complementary pairings)  including peppercorn and chile  cinnamon  nutmeg  clove and cardamom  ginger  and savory herbs and spices. Along the way  Samantha includes stories about her family’s roots and how her Sri Lankan heritage influenced her culinary style  along with fascinating historical insights and storage tips on the various featured spices.  Cinnamon  hazelnut and date buns  ricotta cheesecake with bourbon-raisin jam  orange and honey baklava  orange-clove pull-apart bread  and saffron currant braid were all recipes that instantly called my name. Several years ago  I became hooked on Scandinavian baking and now tend to use cardamom liberally in yeast rolls and sweet breads (even in my morning coffee)  so naturally I was thrilled to see a whole chapter starring my favorite spice!  Measurements are given in both volume and weight (which I appreciate as I find weight measurements to be more reliable). Samantha’s guidance is spot-on there are helpful hints both for new bakers as well as experienced ones to guarantee the best results  particularly for recipes involving yeast. Gorgeous photography by Erin Kunkel highlights various ingredients and finished bakes for maximum (mouth-watering!) impact.  In addition to familiar treats  you’ll find updated versions of international classics such as profiteroles  clafoutis and tarte tatin  Scandinavian bakes like saffron currant braids and cardamom-laced shortbread  Thai banana fritters  Indonesian kue lapis  Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars that are perfect for fall  and other fragrant  delightful baked goods that spiced up my rather predictable baking repertoire. As an experienced home baker  I appreciated the challenge and loved the complexity that the various spices gave to my baked goods and will certainly be baking my way through “The New Sugar and Spice in the near future!  (I received my copy through Blogging for Books),0
tasted good of raspberry and lime,Nice workout supplement. This is a nice preworkout booster. First off it tasted good of raspberry and lime. One scoop gives you a solid 16oz drink if you don't want a super sweet drink that is and it was pretty sweet to be honest so I diluted it a little more than they suggested.  When I went to exercise I definitely had more energy and longer staying power. I had no issues falling asleep later that night  which was about 6 hours after I drank this. I had no jitters or any other negative side effects from this during or after. This is definitely a workout supplement that works.,1
loved the beat of the music,One Eskimo. I really enjoyed this CD I thought it was easy to listen to. I loved the beat of the music and found the words very thought provoking. I also found it very relaxing and music I could listen to over and over again.,1

pulled sweet tea,A gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!. When I think of Malaysian dishes  it’s the spicy  layered flavors of Norman Musa’s “Amazing Malaysian” that I think of. It opens with street food and snacks  and moves on to seafood  meat  vegetables  rice and noodles  pudding and drinks  and the Malaysian pantry. Gorgeous photos of street scenes in Malaysia pepper the pages  while the gold-embossed cover looks great sitting out on a table or countertop.  You'll find street snack favorites like chicken satay  net pancakes  roti canai  and fried spring rolls  along with Indian lentil patties  grilled fish paste in banana leaf  tofu stuffed with crunchy vegetables  and the gorgeous Kak Besah’s curry puffs. The seafood dishes reminded me of many preparations I had last year while working in Taiwan whole fish steamed with lemongrass  ginger and chilies  squid stir fry  and scrambled eggs with oysters. The meat dishes featured are mostly chicken and beef (no pork unlike Ping’s book)  with lamb curry  beef rendang  and numerous chicken dishes.  One of my new favorite recipes is the Nyonya Vermicelli Noodle Salad  which features rice noodles  tofu beansprouts  and ginger with plenty of lime juice and fresh herbs (if you are vegetarian  leave out the shrimp paste and prawns). I also loved the Malay Vegetable Dhal Curry  pumpkin in turmeric and coconut milk  and eggs in chili sambal (think shakshuka).  Rice and noodle dishes include tomato rice (nasi tomato)  wok-fried flat noodles  curry laksa  chicken rice  herbal rice  and several egg-fried rices in addition to fried noodles. Desserts range from the effortless (fresh mango  honey and coconut  tropical fruit salad) to the more elaborate (pandan custard and sticky rice layered sweet  sticky rice balls  soy panna cotta with passion fruit and crushed chocolate cookies. And you’ll find any number of refreshing drinks  from lemongrass and honey tea and rose syrup drink to pulled sweet tea and iced fresh lime juice.  At the end are several staple condiments  from the ubiquitous chili paste and ginger soy sauce  to sambals (chili  coconut)  sauces  and vegetable pickles.  Norman Musa’s recipes tend to be a bit more advanced but also result in more complex  nuanced flavors. This is a gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!,1
sealed weirdly,Poor quality and over priced. Over priced and sealed weirdly so I wouldn’t even use this for fish because they could ingest the sealant because it is put in with so much. It came in a Walmart box and they cost $15 at Walmart,0
applicator makes applying difficult,Good way to tint and color brows. I have sparse eyebrows which have a lot of gray. I tend to get them tinted at least once a month and really should do it more often. When I saw this I was thrilled to try it to help maintain my brows between tinting. On the plus side  the lighter brown color works well for me and it lasts a long time. I am not thrilled with the applicator which makes applying difficult (I wish it was more of a brush than a pointed applicator). I can recommend this to anyone looking to darken or enhance their sparse eye brows.,0
easy to put together,Love  love  love this pet stroller!. I absolutely love this stroller! My small dog (poodle mix) fits in here great (around 9 pounds). This was fairly easy to put together (I am usually technically challenged so that says a lot!). It is well made and my dog just loves it! I love that I can also take it with me for use in the car. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a pet stroller.,1
full color pictures,50 States and where to go book. Santa brought this to me this year  because we travel for work to a lot of different places all over the world and the US.  I am looking forward to using it as a fun reference for wherever we are headed.  Lots of full color pictures and easy to read paragraphs on ideas of what and where to go.  Hardback.,1
molded plastic like material - so no rust,gutter stops. These are cute.. however... they don't really work like the photo shows... unless you have a a torrent of water flowing out of your gutters! Haha.. but they are a cuter end to the gutter than just the end of the gutter pipe.  The back of the gnome is rather large... and a bit awkward to fit exactly.  It more like 'rests' on the bottom of the pipe.  I had to reinforce it with some rocks I had because my pipe didn't come all the way down to the ground.  All in all  it is cute and the water does sort of dribble out  the way it does out of your drain pipe  out of the mouth of the giant frog.  I purchased two of them for pipes that are visible in the front of the house.  They arrived quickly and well packed.  They are molded plastic like material - so no rust. Will last a fairly long time considering you don't throw them around or step on them.  I live right on the Oregon coast front - so it gets cold in the winter - we'll see how they do.,1
great feature,Very easy to load and love buying things from Amazon!. Did this for the free $10 credit but glad I did because it was very easy to do and I plan on doing it again soon! Easy  convenient  and great feature! Happy Prime Member!,1
picture,They don't stick. I got them today. They are so cute. But they are stuck to the paper. Then when you get them off. Its just a picture. I need them. So I will glue them. Buyer beware!,0
Perfect,It IS Perfect!!. I'm 62 and love this primer. That's why I'm here searching for more. If the price is right I may pick up a couple more for stocking stuffers.,1
Thanks Amozan,Five Stars. The gift card came in a pretty box. Thanks Amozan.,1
thrilled,AMAZING!!. You can &#34see&#34 the production with this incredible CD of the musical. A must have! I have purchased the set for family and friends  all are thrilled...,1
"good length for my 6'2"" husband","Nice Shirt. This official C7 Corvette polo shirt is very nice. It's actually a Nike dry fit polo. There's a Nike swoosh on one of the sleeves. The C7 Corvette logo seems to be embroidered on to the shirt. I thought it might be a patch  but it looks like it is embroidered. Either way  it looks good and it's definitely not some iron on decal. The sizing is either true to size or just slightly larger. It has a good length for my 6'2"" husband.",1
happy shopping to all,fluffy blue poms. These were a very lovely decoration for a baby boy shower we had.  They are a tiny bit tricky to put together... take your time and be careful when fluffing them out... you'll be fine.  They arrive flat.  The colors represented are accurate and are what we got.  A selection of sizes and colors.  Used them all.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.  Further  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.  My purchases are VERIFIED  full price paid  and completely independent purchases.  100%.  As are my reviews.  I always try to respond to all questions/comments.  Happy shopping to all!,1
Cuteness,Cuteness. Love the different size prints  I am a hobby crafter and make various items  signs and home decor. These are great for my River Run Rustic Wood Crafts.,1
unisex,does not look like a water shoe. purchased these for my husband  for the beach  does not look like a water shoe  nice looking can be worn with anything. It is soft  it would make a excellent house slipper for someone  it said women  but a men with shoe size 81/2 can wear a women size 10. It look unisex  never told my husband it was a women show. I would recommend it highly. Looks expensive and cool.,1
great gifts,No touch is great 👍. As soon as this touchless soap dispenser arrived  I immediately installed the AA batteries and liquid soap for a wonderful way to maintain a clean and safe bathroom. I will purchase additional units for great gifts to friends and family.,1
great price,A must-have for your earthquake kit!. These are great! I bought them for our earthquake kits and will buy more! In case there's a big one and aftershocks  have this handy in case of more falling objects. Great price as well. Took a few minutes to figure out the straps to put them together- then it was a breeze-  very happy with this purchase.,1
vocals r great,Buy it love it. Great band with fantastic musicians. Im a big Mike Portnoy fan and also now a huge Mike Orlando fan too. Vocals r great too.,1
effective,Sturdy. I bought several of these and replaced my other TSA locks without the &#34entry&#34 notice.  Interestingly  since I put these locks on  my bags haven't been opened once.  I'm sure that is a coincidence.  These are sturdy  easy to use and seem effective.  The loop is average size... so it will fit through most suitcase zipper loops.  I will update if there are any issues.,1
location of the pockets would be lower,A Good Basic Apron Set. The apron & hat set is a good  basic apron set. The fabric is mid-weight - not too heavy & stiff  but also not too flimsy either. It adjusts easily for a good fit. Each pocket on the apron is about the size of my hand. I would prefer if the pockets were a little lower on the apron & if they were just a little wider. I'm not particularly short  (I'm 5'6&#34) but I had to adjust the apron quite a bit so that the ties hit my waistline. I'm sure if I didn't have to adjust it so much  the location of the pockets would be lower. The color is nice & vibrant. In addition to the matching adjustable hat  there was a coordinating pot holder  too.,0
torn areas uniform,Too small  and the torn areas are all uniform. Not a natural tore look.. Too small and more boxy than form fitting like I thought by looking at the picture of jacket. The torn parts look very fake. The areas all uniform in size and shape and lined up with one another perfectly. I wear 1X bought a 3X and couldn't even button it. This jacket it made from heavy material. After wearing it awhile I thought it would weight you down. All the buttons were buttoned up when I received it and were EXTREAMLY hard to unbutton. Returned,0
firm for a good massage,Made of bamboo... The interior is made of bamboo foam - and covered with a cotton sleeve.  Very comfortable roller - firm for a good massage.  My granddaughter swears by it  and is able to handle it easily  for a gentle or very firm massage.  She prefers it to other rollers.,1
works amazingly,The best I’ve used. This works amazingly on my cats! So easy to clean up,1
a little heavier would feel a little better,A Lot of Mouse. I have never used a gaming mouse before. Actually I've looked down on people who did for the same reason I don't like some players being on steroids in major league sports. But now that I'm getting older  my reactions are slower  my fingers are not as quick on the keys and...Oh...I guess I like it for exactly the same reasons athletes love steroids...  But on a serious note.  Mousing and key gnashing do take a toll. I don't know that this mouse is a complete solution to it. But I have had relief of being able to have some things macroed to a single mouse button.  If nothing else  it has created a different movement.  I like the quality of the mouse.  The tracking is very good  the feel is okay  the looks are richly industrial.  I'm not huge on the extending base to the mouse.  I just wish it had been a little bigger to fit my hand  but it fits fine without extending. Personally  a little heavier would feel a little better as well.  All in all I'm very impressed  and wished I had given into &#34juicing&#34 my game a long time ago.,1
could not stop reading it,The Commander. I loved this book  I could not stop reading it  I even was late coming back from lunch at work because it is that good. I want more  please.,1
skinniest Barbie,Beautiful Dresses. I loved these beautifully made dresses.  The gorgeous wedding dress is extremely snug so you'll need to put it on your most skinniest Barbie and even use a tiny pin to keep it velcro'd in back.  I love both dresses so much.  The pink gown is so beautiful.,0
will buy again,Will buy again. Look at first two ingredients.. Butters loves this food. AND: For protein sensitivities  nice option to explore!!,1
clear pictures,Great clear pictures. Last 100 yrs.. Oh  another tech gadget to learn about. I am 63  I learned how to do things on my computer years ago. I cant do anything about tvs  video player hook ups though. When I got this  I thought it would be one of the hard ones because you have to sinc up your iphone with it..ahhh..but actually  if you follow the simple directions it was easy. Yes I did have an issue connecting the two but it was a matter of being patient. I figured it would be difficult to use to print from the phone...boy was I wrong! After you install the hp socket app  you just click on it and your pictures are there. ...helpful hint  it might take a minute or two the first time you sink the two for the pictures to appear on your phone screen...just be patient  it does work. After that they come up very quickly. The unit is nice and small (fits in a shoe box even with cords)  and was packed very well. It comes with 10 picture papers and 1 ink cartridge. The ink is a nice small unit that pops right in! When you have your picture that you are ready to print  you just click on the printer icon that comes up under the picture...one word of caution here... only hit it ONCE!  This is when your patience is a virtue lol. I hit it once  then waited...nothing happened...hit it again..still nothing  hmm then the on light began to flash ( the pic info was coming thru) and the picture began its printing cycle. It prints one color comes out and is sucked back in for another color. It does this 4times  then the picture comes out  drops on the tray and is done! Easy peasy! Until the second picture began to print because remb  I hit the button twice lol because I didnt wait...I didnt know then  but now I do. The second time I printed a picture I hit the print icon and waited..the picture began its cycle. After all this I can honestly say this is the easiest gadget to set up and use! Since it didnt come with much paper  I ordered more. I compared prices on 4 different sites/stores and they were exactly the same as Amazon  34.99 for 80 picture papers and 2 ink cartridges...Im guessing 1 cartridge for every 40 pictures...makes each pic cost 43.73 cents per picture  which is a bit more than printing in stores but I think those machines are harder to use so to me  this is def. worth the money. I just started to check on some features on the app for adding to pictures. There are happy birthday banners you can add to the picture before it prints and a lace one  pumpkins etc. It also has holiday things to add too! I bet there are so many more features in the app to enhance the photos that I will find as I get better using it!  In closing as you might have guessed  I love this machine and find it was the easiest thing to learn about! Get one lol,1
beautiful design,Excellent Celtic Knot Band. I purchased another ring from this seller and was very pleased with it and was looking for something else in the Celtic design. I do quite a bit of typing during the day so a thicker/wider band works better for me and this ring has that along with a beautiful design.  I wear it everyday and couldn't be more please with my purchase.  This is an excellent deal for your money!,1
evil kings,Enjoyed!. Fascinating story! Dragons  elves  Orcs  evil kings  frogs.......wonder what's next. Looking forward to the next part with anticipation! Well done  IMO!,1
wired mic broke within like a week,Great set of microphones. We use these for at home karaoke. We plug into the ION Block Party wireless speaker and they work great. Wireless connectivity works a good distance  like over 100 feet. The wired mic that came with the speaker broke within like a week because the wire got tweaked. These are a great replacement and we don't have to worry about the wires.,0
just ordered the mustard seed pendant,my favorite gift i bought for me. Craftsmanship superb and love the fact its handmade.  I have lots of jewelry.  It sets in special boxes and beautiful containers.  This i want to wear all the time.  I just ordered the mustard seed pendant.  I also make my own jewlery.  Wish i had made it!,1
disappointed about reflective leaf on the back neck,"green turtleneck. Slimfit green turtleneck... I am 5'7""... 38DDD - I usually wear a 14/16 or 0x/1x.  It fits well.. I sized up because it notes ""fitted"" and I am uncomfortable if my shirts are too tight.  It was a good idea.  I gentle washed and low tumble dried - did great.  Didn't notice any obvious shrinkage.  The sleeves are just right - I don't like it if the sleeves are too short.  The material is soft and comfy.  The turtle is not super tight - but fitted.  The green is a lovely forest green.  The one thing I am disappointed about is there is a large  reflective leaf on the back neck of the shirt.  Yuck.  If I would have known that  I would not have purchased.  It's about 3/4"" and the turtle does NOT cover it.  So right on your the back of neck  a giant reflective leaf.  Eh.",0
receiving items that are open,These smell wonderful. These smell wonderful and my clothes had no static cling.  The reason for 4 stars is the box arrived crushed.  It didn't hurt the product  but I don't like receiving items that are open.,0
sleeves have a slight flutter,"Fun Top. This is a cute top for spring or summer. The fabric is very lightweight. The sleeves have a slight flutter that is flattering on the arm. There are functional buttons at the top. If you are a larger cup size  there may be gaps between these buttons. You can easily fix it with either a safety pin or a few stitches. I found the fit to be a bit on the small side. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the large.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
good taste,its not bitter. a little chewy  but overall good taste.,1
requires a strapless bra to be worn,Nice for Summer. I ordered this dress for my teen daughter. She loves to wear dresses in the summer months and this one is perfect for that. My daughter is 5'7&quot and weighs about 130 pounds. She wears a medium to large in junior sizes and a small to medium in misses. I went by the measurements provided and selected a medium. We may have been able to get by on a small  but her cup size is a C and we have found that many dresses are too tight in that area. This one fits well on her. The length is long  but not to the floor. My picture doesn't show how long it is in on her  but it is similar to the model in the picture. The straps are adjustable. It requires a strapless bra to be worn. The dress itself is a basic  cotton knit dress. It flows nicely and hangs well. The quality is in the mid range. There were a few loose threads  but the seams are good.  *I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest &amp unbiased review. My thoughts &amp opinions are my own.,1
air started seeping out,This is horrible. 0 stars if I could give 0. It was hard to fill with air  no matter how much we flopped it around.  We finally used a heavy duty blower to fill it up.  After filling it up  we laid on it and the air started seeping right out.  Couldn't lay on it for more than 5 minutes.  I do not recommend.,0
love the color and thickness of the material,Comfortable. Great quality set. Perfect for working out or lounging. Love the color and thickness of the material. I normally wear a small or medium and the medium fit perfectly. Love the tie waist and ribbed texture.,1
smaller than I expected,Five Stars. Bought this for entertaining & it's a fun piece. It's smaller than I expected though.,0
can't get the barrette around my hair,Really like these. So why 4 stars?  I read the review  measured it out and decided for the large instead of the next larger choice  because I really have some thick hair.  They are so pretty  and they even gave me an extra stick. I love using them however I can't use them as I did when I was younger (yes in the 70's).  I can't get the barrette around my hair - I have to use a band first - which defeats both it being pretty and it's use to begin with.  I can attach it  but not around 'all' of my hair.  So I should have ordered the larger ones  because I was trying to omit the band altogether as they give my headaches which is why I used them back in the day.  So I eventually cut my hair length and now use these just to tack the front hair back.  If you have really thick hair  buy the larger size!,0
pay for all my stuff,touch and hold smooth dual door closer system. Husband purchased these to replace some others that had given up the ghost.  We live on the oceanfront and the salt takes a toll.  These are nice because you can do it with your foot (when install at the base of the door) just tap it and it stays open  tap again and it releases.  Easy Peasy.  He prefers these and says they are easy to install.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes. Bottom line  I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,1
acting was wonderful,Great factual movie!. I thought this was one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Acting was wonderful (don't believe the other reviewers) and I thought the directing was superb. If you enjoy fact based movies  this is one that should not be missed. No small wonder it won at the Sundance Film festival last year. Great  great movie. Buy it and watch it with your high school/ college age kids!,1
highlights include three previously unreleased full shows,Musical Nirvana for the diehard '70s Elvis fan. Elvis in concert in the '70s.  Always a bone of contention among fans  probably because -- like the '60s film years -- it was allowed to go on too long and Elvis found himself in another artistic rut.  Happily  the downturn had yet to really take hold at the time of Elvis On Tour.  He was still involved and committed and enjoying it all in 1972  and fans -- both newbies and long term -- were the better for it all.  This collection's highlights include three previously unreleased full shows as well as a remixed concert  rehearsals  and behind the curtain RCA Studio C  Hollywood tracks  plus the BluRay version of the original film release.  A visit to Elvis Nirvana for Elvis diehards.  What would've made it all the better  for me anyway  would have been the reconstruction of the Standing Room Only (original  discarded title) soundtrack album.  That proposed 1972 LP was sacrificed in favor of the Madison Square Garden album (which actually even copped its cover photo!).  Thus  the singles Burning Love b/w It's a Matter of Time and Separate Ways b/w Always on My Mind were relegated to budget Camden releases  and An American Trilogy b/w The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face remained homeless.  Thus far it's only ever been available as an overly expensive Follow That Dream import release.  Including it here would've been the perfect -- though decades late -- salute to early '70s Elvis and his fans.  Still  as is  On Tour is worthy of five golden scarves and I highly recommend it.,1
pattern,Space savers. 1st of all I love the fact that these are acrylic And not glass. I really don't like using glass in picture frames because they break if they fall off the wall or if someone knocks them over on the table. You can display these Either up and down or sideways depending on the picture. They look nice next to each other in any pattern. Very smart idea.,1
everyday use,Use everyday. Great after a shower.,1
natural shell,"mother of pearl back splash square. I was hoping this was going to be a bit more white - but they are natural shell  so they are very creamy.  I love the look  but it won't work for my bathroom project.  I purchased a single tile to ""try""... I highly recommend you do so.  The photos are lovely  but in person is quite different.  While I won't be using these  they are still quite lovely and natural looking",1
ordered all I could by them,Great Group. This is a great group.  I really enjoy their music.  Twenty years ago I visited Halifax.  I heard this group singing.  I contacted their managed  trying to get a CD.  He did send me several from other groups but unfortunately  this group did not have one.  As the years past I still remembered how much I had enjoyed them.  A few months ago I thought I would google them.  I was surprised to find that they now had become more well known.  I ordered all I could by them and am enjoying all of their music very much.,1
comes a little past my calves,Love. This kimono thing looks really awesome. I really enjoyed the look of it. Super light  so it is great for warmer weather. It does come a little past my calves  but not quite to my ankles.,1
perfect size,Nice and soft. This rug is very attractive and is the perfect size for my bedroom.  I love the different color  it makes it blend well with the room.  The reason for 4 stars is the price. It could be a little plusher for the price.  You will love the colors.  I love the way it brings the colors of my bedroom together.,1
look great,Bright!. Very bright and light up the night!  Have them in basket holding firewood and they look great.,1
vegetable pickles,A gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!. When I think of Malaysian dishes  it’s the spicy  layered flavors of Norman Musa’s “Amazing Malaysian” that I think of. It opens with street food and snacks  and moves on to seafood  meat  vegetables  rice and noodles  pudding and drinks  and the Malaysian pantry. Gorgeous photos of street scenes in Malaysia pepper the pages  while the gold-embossed cover looks great sitting out on a table or countertop.  You'll find street snack favorites like chicken satay  net pancakes  roti canai  and fried spring rolls  along with Indian lentil patties  grilled fish paste in banana leaf  tofu stuffed with crunchy vegetables  and the gorgeous Kak Besah’s curry puffs. The seafood dishes reminded me of many preparations I had last year while working in Taiwan whole fish steamed with lemongrass  ginger and chilies  squid stir fry  and scrambled eggs with oysters. The meat dishes featured are mostly chicken and beef (no pork unlike Ping’s book)  with lamb curry  beef rendang  and numerous chicken dishes.  One of my new favorite recipes is the Nyonya Vermicelli Noodle Salad  which features rice noodles  tofu beansprouts  and ginger with plenty of lime juice and fresh herbs (if you are vegetarian  leave out the shrimp paste and prawns). I also loved the Malay Vegetable Dhal Curry  pumpkin in turmeric and coconut milk  and eggs in chili sambal (think shakshuka).  Rice and noodle dishes include tomato rice (nasi tomato)  wok-fried flat noodles  curry laksa  chicken rice  herbal rice  and several egg-fried rices in addition to fried noodles. Desserts range from the effortless (fresh mango  honey and coconut  tropical fruit salad) to the more elaborate (pandan custard and sticky rice layered sweet  sticky rice balls  soy panna cotta with passion fruit and crushed chocolate cookies. And you’ll find any number of refreshing drinks  from lemongrass and honey tea and rose syrup drink to pulled sweet tea and iced fresh lime juice.  At the end are several staple condiments  from the ubiquitous chili paste and ginger soy sauce  to sambals (chili  coconut)  sauces  and vegetable pickles.  Norman Musa’s recipes tend to be a bit more advanced but also result in more complex  nuanced flavors. This is a gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!,1
absorbs quickly,Another great Vichy facial care product!. This is a really nice serum at much less a cost than that on other quality products. I love Vichy products in general and this serum is no exception. Goes on easily  absorbs quickly and I see a definite brightness in my skin and complexion after just using for less than a month now. I highly recommend Vichy for all your skin care needs. Don't spend hundreds of dollars when you spend less than $50 and get the same results!,1
not pink in any way,Not the same color as shown. This charm looks pink. The one I received was not pink in any way. I did not like. Returned it.,0
interesting orchestrations,Bette is Back. The best new thing Ms Midler has done in a long time.  Every single song is great.  Interesting choices  interesting orchestrations  but all winners.,1
love this song,LOVE THIS SONG. I think this is a great song and I love it. I keep listening to it over and over again.,1
gave to my mom for Christmas,Great music. I gave this to my mom for Christmas and she loves it!!,1
Bad plastic nut,Bad plastic nut. Doesn't fix.. Don't like it at all. Do not recommend.,0
the coloring was dramatic,Definitely not for me!. Unlike others  I found this awful. First  I used it sparingly on my legs after showering twice (two days in a row). I will say  the moisturizing was great  went on smooth and had a very light fragrance and there was nothing visible to be seen upon the initial application . I didn't notice until the following morning (after the two applications) that the coloring was dramatic and the top of my feet (where I hadn't put any on) were a stark white when compared to a dark brown legs (with streaks). I also saw in between my fingers  some brown coloring. I ended up using a wash cloth to try to clean up my legs and my fingers and ended up making the streaks even worse. I am not sure who can use this or why. I would prefer to spend $10 and get a spray tan as this is way too difficult to see what the impact will be until a day or two after the application and at that time  it will be too late. Might be good for someone else  but not me.,0
sound is uniformly fabulous,Beach Boys' Sounds of Summer Redux. The sound is uniformly fabulous.  The hits (99% of them  anyway) are all here.  The 80 (!) tracks spread over three discs have never sounded better  truly.  Following on the heels of the fantastic Feel Flows box set though  there's a certain bump in the road here.  The trouble is the programming it's just so random.  Spanning the Boys' 60-year-career  it would have made a lot more sense (to me  anyway) to program the sets in chronological order according to release  whether by each individual disc or start-to-finish across all three discs.  A minor complaint  I admit  but annoying enough to me that I can't give it the full tilt boogie I'd like to.  Four classic Hobie surfboards and definitely recommended to fans of the band.,1
wonderful,Smuggler’s Bounty Final Boxes EVER!!!. Smugglers Bounty went through a lot. It was wonderful and then not so wonderful. Unfortunately  there’s only TWO boxes left before it’s gone forever. I have enjoyed most of them and perhaps they could’ve continued by adding more interesting trinkets  but perhaps it will evolve into something better as they said something new will come after this is done. So get your October box and get the last box in December. Hopefully they go out with a Bang!!,1
fit to be a bit on the small side,"Fun Top. This is a cute top for spring or summer. The fabric is very lightweight. The sleeves have a slight flutter that is flattering on the arm.

not worth anything,Not worth the money after a while. I was subscribed for almost a year. The 1st box was the best  and it went down hill from there. Very expensive and not worth anything,0
decent value,These bags are a decent thickness.  They add both sides together to get the 9.5 mil. Don't think the bag side is 9.5 mil thick.  It's a total of both sides when laying flat.  The bags are still of good quality.  They are a decent value at approximately 33 cents each.  I would buy these again.  Be careful with hard pointy items such as dehydrated carrots  they can poke through.,1
historical fiction,"If I could give it twenty stars instead of five I would!. I finally got around to reading ""On a Falling Tide"" by the uber-talented Georgia Hill as it had been in my to-read pile for far too long and wow what a book! A haunting and original page-turner  this book had me hooked from start to finish. I love historical fiction and none more so than when it has a touch of the supernatural and a gothic romance feel to it. I have read many time-lapse books that other reviewers have called atmospheric but ""On a Falling Tide"" really takes that word to a whole new level! There is love  loss  and of course as with any great haunting read  plenty of madness  which I assure you as a reader  you will feel too. The characters of Charity  Matt  and Lydia are so well written that they are almost tangible  as is the wonderful fictional town of Beaumouth which is set on the very real and beautiful Jurrasic Coast in England (where I was lucky enough to be born and grow up next to). I just cannot say enough good things about this book and if I could give it twenty stars instead of five on Goodreads I would! I cannot wait to see what else Georgia has up her talented sleeve.",1
cheap,One Star. Cheap and breaks easy,0
works,Wow - really works!!. This is amazing!!! Will be purchasing more when needed,1
"""light""","this is a medium tint- definitely gives sun kissed glow  absorbs well  hydrates  non greasy. Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says  ""medium"" in the product description  which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level  so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle  BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink  with cool undertones. Still  I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in  but it gives me a slight tanned look  ""a sun kissed glow"".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..  This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen  using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays  converts them to heat  then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available  blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great  and it depends on what works best with  your skin.  This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious  skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter  jojoba  oilve oil  and vitamin e. It comes out thin  and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round  and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often  sweating it off  etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized  I feel better about keeping it so simple.  Again  I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the ""medium"" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a ""sun kissed glow"". If that is at all appealing to you  then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool  fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast  at all. If your skin is real oily  then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy  and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.  My skin: mid 40s  leans dry  semi sensitive  non-acne Rosacea (redness  visible veins)  I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year  and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else  it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot  and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck  then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try  and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).  I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new  or think of anything else.",0
finished them in a few days,Great treats. These were absolutely delicious! My wife and I finished them in a few days. I would highly recommend these for yourself or a gift!,1
steaming coffee in 2 hours,I recommend this if you would like steaming coffee in 2 .... I turned this upside down in a glass to see if it would leak and it did not.  I poured fresh hot coffee in it and left it for 2 hours and it was steaming when I opened it. After closing it again and leaving it another 2 hours  the coffee was warm  but no longer steaming.  It kept water cold for a couple of hours.  I recommend this if you would like steaming coffee in 2 hours.  It does say that it is not leakproof and maybe it isn't but it did not leak for me when left upside down.  I didn't try leaving it sideways.,1
connects easily to xbox and ipad,Great gaming headset. Great value gaming headset. Comes with all the standard adapters. Fit is comfortable and connects easily to Xbox and iPad. Mic works will with online game play. These aren’t an all around headset. The audio isn’t going to blow you away if you’re an  audiofile. This is a value headset for gaming.,1
Fits 100% perfect,I have not tested the shock yet.. Fits 100% perfect. Look original.,1
packs well for travel,Great Alternative to Clarisonic. If you want a good facial cleansing brush  but don't want to spend $200  this is a good alternative. The brush is compact and easy to hold. It doesn't take up much space on a counter. It also packs well for travel. It's cordless and rechargeable. It's a good skincare tool. Don't forget to clean your brush with antibacterial soap after each use.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1

few foods,"just ""ok"". First.. this app is free... So I will keep it at 3 stars... it's just that there is so very few foods on it...  Wishing and hoping for a much more involved list.  I like that it lists alternatives... just need MORE foods!  I always update with any issues or other useful info.",0
never hesitate to update my reviews,waterproof vinyl tablecloth. these are fair quality plastic table cloths  the best thing is the elastic edge all around the table  fits like a fitted sheet.  You'll need to smooth for a good fit  just like you do a fitted sheet. I am disappointed that they are not machine washable. They have a really crappy felt like material on the underside so if you did try to machine wash they would just become a ball. So  you do have to wipe them down and thoroughly dry for storage.  They are not super quality so you may get 2 or 3 uses if you are careful not to tear.  So for the price  maybe that is good enough.  I purchased 4  - and having said that I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
6 year old grandson loves to play in my lower yard,plastic construction equipment. These are about half or a third the size of the original metal tonka trucks. I purchased the dump truck and a scraper/loader. Both came with hard hats and a separate claw digger. They are pretty stout and the hard hats are surprisingly stout as well.  My 6 year old grandson loves to play in my lower yard which is sand.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
Scenery is very beautiful,All the actors were excellent. Scenery is very beautiful but almost the entire .... Really enjoyable movie!  All the actors were excellent.  Scenery is very beautiful but almost the entire movie takes place in one village.  I thoroughly enjoyed The Hundred Foot Journey as I have all of Lasse Halstrom's movies!,1
use gloves or tweezers,fabric fusion glue. Ok.  This stuff works.  IF you're gluing FABRIC to FABRIC.  Nothing else.  And NO felt.  Another note.  Use gloves or tweezers to apply.  Wash immediately if you get any on your skin.  If you have 2 layers  makes sure to put something plastic between the two layers.  I haven't tried to wash it yet  but I think it's pretty solid.  Having said all of that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
lighter brown color works well,Good way to tint and color brows. I have sparse eyebrows which have a lot of gray. I tend to get them tinted at least once a month and really should do it more often. When I saw this I was thrilled to try it to help maintain my brows between tinting. On the plus side  the lighter brown color works well for me and it lasts a long time. I am not thrilled with the applicator which makes applying difficult (I wish it was more of a brush than a pointed applicator). I can recommend this to anyone looking to darken or enhance their sparse eye brows.,1

cushions do not go all the way to the end,dining room chair cushions. I have some very  very hard wood dining room chairs.  They have very large seats.  I have been looking for cushions that would fit for months.  Now.  As you can see by the pics I have provided  they do not go all the way to the end of the seat portion of the chair.  However  we you sit on them  the cushion &#34spreads&#34 to the edge  so you don't feel the edge of the chair.  They are approximately 1 1/2&#34 to 2&#34 thick. They are just enough cushioning.  The blue is a sort of a turquoise... definitely not a marine blue  - I think the pic I provided pretty accurately shows the color.  The only other color option was a green.  I do wish there had been a more neutral color option... a dark tan... a chocolate brown?  I do think you could turn the cushions over.  The ties are sewn well and strong.  The design is sort of quilted in look and in texture - it is the same on both sides. The tags say &#34made in the USA with imported/USA materials.&#34  As for cleaning.. it says spot cleaning only. Fill and cover are listed as 100% polyester.  I do like that they are water and fade resistant.  Even though I am using them inside  perhaps they will stand up to little more use. I never hesitate to update my review should new info seem useful.,0

Ahava Osmoter product,Wonderful product! Highly recommend!. I need to begin by saying I absolutely love Ahava products. I found Ahava on a pilgrimage I did to Israel in 2008 and a visit to the site of Masada at the Dead Sea. I picked up a gift package of a few of their products and I was immediately hooked. Every day I use their Mud exfoliator  at night I use their night cream and at least once a week I use one of their Mud Pack facial products. I am 61 years old and am often told I look to be in my low 50s. I was thrilled when I saw this new Ahava Osmoter product. I have been using this daily now for about a week and I will say my skin feels and looks like it is glowing. It goes on like silk  has a nice subtle fragrnace and my skin feels amazing throughout the day (even after I put on makeup and/or sun screen). I know this is pricy and you might be able to do better purchasing elsewhere (if you find it cheaper). You won't find a product line that is better for you than Ahava  feeding your skin richly with Dead Sea minerals and keeping you looking young and vibrant.,1
fit,Five Stars. Nice quality and great fit.,1
well made,Need expertise to install. I've kept this for months because I like the IDEA of it  but you have to drill  through your roof and put in an outside antenna.  It's way too complex so it's still in the box.  Looks well made.  Instructions might as well be in a foreign language.  Electrician won't install it due to drilling through roof.  So .....,1
well made,Nice product  sizing off!. Product is well made  but sizing seems way off for women. I purchased the XS for women's size 6  and they are so tight that my toes are bent under and the ankle opening is unbearably  circulation-cuttingly tight. They looked like doll's socks  for real. Sent them back for a size small instead. My husband's XL fit perfectly for his size 10.5 shoes! Snug  but not uncomfortably so.,1
learn to say sorry,My review of Bigger than the sky. Beautiful  contemporary love story. Well-written  edited  all the characters were likeable  believable plot and it just flowed really well. Amelia and Kade reconnect in the small town they grew up in five years after she left him at the altar. She has to learn to trust him again  learn to say sorry and practice forgiveness. We watch her struggle with all three but succeed in the end  of course. Kade is the typical alpha male and what can I say but ... yes. There are a lot of very good but descriptive intimate scenes. A lot. Not complaining though because they were written in very well. What I also truly enjoyed was the humor. Being inside Amelia's head was wonderful  she is a good mess. Overall  a very good book and because I loved the other characters I would definitely continue with the series.,0

ideal with wine and canapes,Subtle Bacon Flavor. Great crispy cheese crackers! These are ideal with wine and canapes.,1
accommodate assorted sizes of brushes,Great for Traveling. This make up brush bag is great for traveling. It's long enough to accommodate assorted sizes of brushes. It zips up  but not around the base. It can be stood up for easy access  but it's not always steady. I like that it's clear vinyl at the top so you can see the contents.,1
triggers and meltdowns in detail,"""You have Asperger's. Asperger's doesn't have you."" Can I get an amen?. Rudy Simone's ""Aspergirls: Empowering Females With Asperger Syndrome"" is a wonderful starting point for all Aspergirls  whether you're an Aspergirl yourself or you have an Apergirl in your life. This thoughtfully-written guide examines the oft-overlooked Aspergirl  who's been clinically ignored in favor of male Aspies (traditional figures put the boy-girl ratio at 4:1  but that is rapidly changing as 1 in 100 children are believed to be on the autism spectrum). Because Aspergirls may be better at socializing in small doses and tend to be a little more expressive than their male counterparts  they may be able to ""pass"" as neurotypical (NT) and not receive a proper AS diagnosis other than being ""shy"" or ""difficult.""  Simone has interviewed numerous Aspergirls regarding their experiences in all walks of life  from surviving schoolyard bullies  PTSD  and selective mutism to college  dating  motherhood and employment. She also discusses the Asperger's ""is it a gift or a disability?"" debate. Each chapter ends with ""Advice to Aspergirls"" and ""Advice to Parents "" a thoughtful touch that includes the whole family in the discussion. The book wraps up with advice from Aspergirls to Aspergirls (inspirational bullet points such as the title of this review) and the cleverly-titled ""Give Your Aspergirl some B.A.L.L.S.: Belief  Acceptance  Love  Like  and Support."" Appendix A also features a handy chart of female Asperger traits and main female / male differences in Asperger's. There is a small list of references and resources  and I was surprised not to see any of Tony Attwood's books listed (although he's mentioned by name several times). Simone frequently promotes her own books [[ASIN:1849058032 22 Things a Woman Must Know: If She Loves a Man With Asperger's Syndrome]] and [[ASIN:1935274090 Asperger's on the Job: Must-have Advice for People with Asperger's or High Functioning Autism  and their Employers  Educators  and Advocates]] in nearly every chapter.  Simone and the various interviewees put Aspie sensations into words that NTs can understand this is in itself a feat  since our first language isn't words  but images and sensations (see [[ASIN:0307739589 Thinking in Pictures (Expanded  Tie-in Edition): My Life with Autism (Vintage)]]). Simone discusses triggers (fluorescent lights  loud noises  scratchy fabrics) and meltdowns in detail  both internally and externally. In the chapter on stimming  she introduces the term ""soothing "" which has fewer negative connotations.  There are several chapters devoted to depression  medication  abuse and PTSD. I was particularly interested in Chapter 19  Stomach Issues and Autism. I've had digestive issues my whole life  and never previously connected AS with digestive disorders. At times  the book went into New Age-y territory  with suggestions on herbal supplements and discussions on psychic sensitivity  reiki  and chi  along with several popular AS diets  including gluten-free and casein-free (see: [[ASIN:184310055X A User Guide to the GF/CF Diet for Autism  Asperger Syndrome and AD/HD]] for more information).  When I was younger  Aspergers wasn't ever mentioned and hadn't gained the widespread recognition that it currently has. I sincerely wish that this book had been available throughout my rocky adolescence hopefully  ""Aspergirls"" will smooth the path for today's young Aspergirls. If you're the parent of an Aspergirl  some of the stories in this book are on the lower-functioning end of the Aspergers scale don't automatically assume that your daughter will exhibit *all* of these symptoms. Every Aspergirl is different. Just be proud of your smart  funny  and talented daughter. Or if you're an Aspergirl yourself...Aspergrrrrrl power!",0
rugged exterior,Heavy  great protection and a solid value. I purchased this to house a Yamaha MG12  which it did perfectly. To be sure  the footprint is pretty large  and it's heavy  but it is also rock solid.  There is ample room between the rear of the case and the MG12 to accommodate the power cable  and I can also place a few spare cables in that area.  The exterior is rugged.  Be aware  though  that with the mixer (the MG12) it is pretty heavy. I have a Rock-N-Roller cart  so hauling it is not a problem as long as stairs are not involved. Can I recommend it?  Yes. Would I still buy it knowing what I now know? Absolutely. Bang for the buck there is nothing close (that I have found  anyway.,1
pricing,Good job. Nice selection  some good products. I liked some of the cookies best. Like that it seems you are avoiding sugar alcohols which neither of us can tolerate. We had a coupon that made the pricing very fair and reasonable. Not sure if we can afford to keep it up all year since we only eat about 2/3 of the box. The bunny keychain was cute. I removed the keychain and it's one of my dogs favorite toys (yes  we watch her closely with it).,1
accurate measurements,pantry LED light. Very bright... easy for husband to install - but he does have a higher level electrical ability... We installed in a small walk in pantry about 4'x4' and it lights up the enter area nicely.  The light is white... not yellow looking.  No flickering.  Should last for many years. Measurements provided are accurate.  I will update my review though  should new info seem useful.,1
runs about 20 mins before it needs to be charged again,Amphibious RC car. Purchased for my grandsons (7 & 10 yrs) in the pool and it's been fun.  It needs to be fully charged before the first use and runs about 20 mins before it needs to be charged again.  The remote uses regular disposable batteries. It is weighty and feels sturdy.  I hope it will last a little while.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new inf seem useful.,1
screen protectors,NOT A GOOD CASE TO PROTECT MY NEW S20+ ULTRA. Not a good case!  My phone fell 2x and both times my screen cracked.  I just bought a new case and screen protectors to cover the cracks.,1
do not need to soak them,Excellent deal and fits some interesting mics. First: you do not need to soak them or do anything else other than spread them with your fingers and let them set overnight. They are like memory foam in that respect. I mention this because there are reviews here that recommend that you soak them. Not necessary.  Mine fit more than your typical SM58 form factor. I have one on a Shure 87A  one on a Sennheiser e945 and another on a very odd shaped mic  the Blue enCore 300.  The do what they are supposed to. I use them on mics in my studio to keep things sanitary.  Bottom line: do not freak out it you receive what appears to be black  foam pancakes. They will come to life very easily.,1
PINNACLE STUDIO 20 PLUS software,Reverted Again to Simple-Minded Movie Editing Software. Someday  someone will invent easy-to-use  intuitive software for movie editing.  This PINNACLE STUDIO 20 PLUS software is NOT that product.  Because I make movies only for products reviewed on Amazon  I lack the time and motivation to overcome the relatively steep learning curve required for using this full-featured software to good effect.  Once again  I have reverted to using the simplistic Microsoft Movie Maker software for compiling slideshows and editing short movies to accompany reviews.  It's plenty good enough for my purposes  especially given how much the Amazon photo and movie processing takes away from my submitted high-quality photo and movie files.,0
off beat,sort of off beat. I hate reviewing movies... they are so subjective.  But I love this movie.  I am a John Cusack fan  but the story is why I like this sort of off beat story.  It's thought provoking and a little odd.  Kinda like me.  :)  You might be able to stream it before jumping in for the purchase and judge for yourself.,1
purchase more,Scent of Stories. Love the way this smells! It's a great balance between the lilac and the berries. Will definitely purchase more when I run out.,1
basic piece,Five Stars. Nice basic piece and works well under semi-sheer tops.,1
unreal,Poorly done (decent cast  poor plot  erratic story line and not very nice characters). Truly poor - shallow  poorly developed & unlikeable characters who didn’t seem to even like each other.  A bride who showed zero concern for her missing groom-to-be throughout the entire movie.  Poor script  weak plot and over-the-top acting.  This is drivel & a waste of time to watch.  I've read many 'cosy mysteries' and this movie tries to bring one to the screen  but the entire plot is poorly developed and the characters are unreal.  For example  one character goes from making love to her old boyfriend who soon afterwards pushes her off a cliff allegedly because she had previously broken up their relationship.  Not even soap opera good.,0
love the last of the 4 so far,Pirates of the Caribbean 4 set. I am HUGE Pirates fan AND a Johnny Depp fan... so double bonus for me.  You have to own all 4 if you're going to watch them. Each one good in it's own way.  Clearly the first is one of the best.  However  I personally love the last of the 4 so far.  I love the mermaids.  Oooo.  Watch out guys.  In any case... I would say ok for age 8 and up... but that is a personal thought... to each their own I don't judge.,1
Good Old Tunes,Good Old Tunes!!. I’ve Loved Moody Blues for 40+ Years Finally Bought an album,1
BluRay version of the original film release,Musical Nirvana for the diehard '70s Elvis fan. Elvis in concert in the '70s.  Always a bone of contention among fans  probably because -- like the '60s film years -- it was allowed to go on too long and Elvis found himself in another artistic rut.  Happily  the downturn had yet to really take hold at the time of Elvis On Tour.  He was still involved and committed and enjoying it all in 1972  and fans -- both newbies and long term -- were the better for it all.  This collection's highlights include three previously unreleased full shows as well as a remixed concert  rehearsals  and behind the curtain RCA Studio C  Hollywood tracks  plus the BluRay version of the original film release.  A visit to Elvis Nirvana for Elvis diehards.  What would've made it all the better  for me anyway  would have been the reconstruction of the Standing Room Only (original  discarded title) soundtrack album.  That proposed 1972 LP was sacrificed in favor of the Madison Square Garden album (which actually even copped its cover photo!).  Thus  the singles Burning Love b/w It's a Matter of Time and Separate Ways b/w Always on My Mind were relegated to budget Camden releases  and An American Trilogy b/w The First Time I Ever Saw Your Face remained homeless.  Thus far it's only ever been available as an overly expensive Follow That Dream import release.  Including it here would've been the perfect -- though decades late -- salute to early '70s Elvis and his fans.  Still  as is  On Tour is worthy of five golden scarves and I highly recommend it.,0
great for making pasta and soups,Great stockpot  perfect for everyone!. This is a great stockpot for the money. First  it is super attractive  well made and lightweight. I love this color  too  it blends with all my kitchen decor. I love Rachel Ray products as they always provide good products at reasonable prices. This 6 quart size is great for making pasta and soups. This would make an excellent bridal shower or housewarming present for anyone. Highly recommend!,1
quality and effective,Good quality and effective. Used to size a power take off shaft for a new tractor implement. Was able to cut through two mating shafts with hardly any noticeable wear on a single disc. I will be keeping a supply of these in my tools.,1
good quality,Good quality  reasonably priced desk/table. This Decoholic computer desk is surprisingly nice for the money. Nicely made  good quality and super easy to put together (took me about 10 minutes and I am usually technically challenged when it comes to this stuff). Super functional  nice size  it can be used as a desk or even as just a place to showcase items in your home. I already had a desk in my home (one with drawers) and I am using this as a place to put my printer. Highly recommend!,1
lasts a long time,Good way to tint and color brows. I have sparse eyebrows which have a lot of gray. I tend to get them tinted at least once a month and really should do it more often. When I saw this I was thrilled to try it to help maintain my brows between tinting. On the plus side  the lighter brown color works well for me and it lasts a long time. I am not thrilled with the applicator which makes applying difficult (I wish it was more of a brush than a pointed applicator). I can recommend this to anyone looking to darken or enhance their sparse eye brows.,1
dresses up my plant collection,Attractive. A very nice looking flower pot.  It really dresses up my plant collection.,1
Bernadette Peters is phenomenal,Wonderful. Bernadette Peters is phenomenal all the time and this DVD of her performance is wonderful. She has the greatest voice. I bought a used DVD and am hoping it will play okay.,1
play music,Great microphone speaker. My son loves to sing so I bought him this for xmas. It was easy to pair up with my iPhone 6s. I was able to play music from my music library or the amazon music app. Great sound. I wasn't sure how to lower the sound though from the microphone. I had to do it from my phone. And I wish there was an option to do a light show instead of just picking one LED color. Love being able to charge using USB instead of batteries. I definitely recommend this bluetooth karaoke microphone.,1
easy to clean,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
fit runs a bit small,Runs a Bit Small. These are good leggings for all types of workouts. The fabric is very soft and stretchy. There's good tummy control. The waistband may roll down a bit while doing some exercises. The fit runs a bit small. I sized up for comfort.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,0
ruggedly made micro USB cable,Nice Rugged Cable that Can Fulfill a Lot More Roles. This is a nice  ruggedly made micro USB cable. So it can be so much more than just a PS4 cable.  In fact I have found that our PS4 is more sensitive to bad cables than any other device we have  so since it works on our PS4  we can expect it to work for all our micro USB devices.  At $9 you can get a cheaper cable  but again  we have had issues with cheaper cables in the past on the PS4. It is not an outrageous price by any means but you could save a little.  What you do get for the added cost is a nice thick cable with strong ends that I don't foresee unravelling any time soon.  We love the color which also helps identify it as our PS4 cable.  We are very happy with it and are glad to be able to charge another controller at the same time.,1
charges fast,Great for kids. Really great quality for price. Nice big screen and the protector is great. It came set up to my amazon account already (I don’t know how they did that). There are a TON of free downloads. Games and shows. Charges fast and battery lasts a while. My daughter was so happy and loves it. Highly recommend,1
effective,Loud but effective. This thing works GREAT considering how inexpensive it was. It's quite loud at full power  but you can adjust the speed up and down depending on your needs. Most importantly  it effectively sucks in dust when you file over it  helping to keep down the scattering of nail dust all over yourself  your clothes  your work surface  etc.,1
good,These are good. I like these better than some of the more well-known brands.  We enjoyed the mix of different shapes and flavors.,1
giant number/buttons,large dial corded phone. purchased for use when the power goes out... giant number/buttons... NOT back lit... but super easy to see.  Speaker phone works  handy when you need to keep your hands free.  3 giant boxes for pictures of persons you want to speed dial... I don't use that part... but this phone was designed for an older person I think.  :)  A considerable amount of control options... med  high or very high handset volume... ringer hi/lo or off... and a slide control of the speaker volume...  It has a redial button.  A speaker button.  And a flash button.  It has a red corner on the top left that indicates the ring - so when you have the ring off (and when it is on) that light flashes.  There is a dedicated 911 button that is red. The handset sets in the cradle fairly well at the top... the bottom a bit less... and the bottom is what matters.  If the bottom is off the cradle  the phone registers off the hook. I use it sitting on a corner stand... it does have a hole you could hand on the wall.  It is bright white.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. I hope that the time I took to write this detailed review is helpful to you in some way!,1
wait,Great Collection!. Well worth the wait! Excellent collaboration! Thank you!,1
can be used as a ring box forever,Beautiful ring box. This is a beautiful ring box that will be fantastic to propose to someone. I liked it so much  I got another. The box is wood and it is held together with a magnet. The box is just expensive looking and can be used as a ring box forever. These boxes are hand made too. Quality all around.,1
Love it,Great music.. Can't go wrong with Elvis gospel. Love it.,1
haunting,"A must-have CD for an outstanding price. I first read about Daniel Taylor on the SchollSociety messageboards and Amazon.com and I was intrigued. A Canadian countertenor with a voice comparable to Andreas Scholl's? ...I couldn't resist. I took it along on a three-hour bus ride to Tadoussac  Québec.  As the mournful opening strains of Erbarme Dich commenced  the haunting  sweeping violins and viol carried me along the winding roads through the mountains. The sky was overcast  and as I heard Taylor's voice for the first time the sun came out. I was in Heaven beautiful vistas of mountains on one side  jagged cliffs plunging into the St. Laurent on the other and Daniel Taylor's voice in my ears. Erbarme Dich is deep  passionate  and so achingly beautiful. I am an avid lover of Bach but it was the first time I had heard anything from St. Matthew's Passion. I was more familiar with many of the other Dowland songs: Time Stands Still  Come Again  Flow My Tears  and I Saw My Lady Weep  all of which are present on Andreas Scholl's ""English Folksongs and Lute Songs.""  Daniel Taylor's voice is exquisite. Haunting. Ethereal. A creamy  lush  pure sound  more feminine than Scholl's tone  reminiscent of brilliant Japanese countertenor Yoshikazu Mera. As with Scholl  the effect sounds effortless and angelic. ""Daniel Taylor: Portrait"" is an excellent introduction to an amazing talent. Ten stars.",1
1$/ issue price,Excellent journalism for a fair price. Excellent surveys  original articles. The level is amazing for 1$/ issue price. Recommend from all my heart!,1
starting out as an amazing read,Amazing read.. Amazing read...confirmed my personal beliefs that we are already living on paradise here on earth  and it will be up to man kind to figure how to love one another in order to maintain this precious ecosystem and continue to flourish and develop as a people.  I was a bit disappointed that Bruce did not share a bit more about his personal transformation  but overall an easy read for the non-scientific minded like me!  Also I just picked up Suggestible You  by Erik Vance which was mentioned in Bruce Lipton's book and this is starting out as an amazing read as well.  If anyone has other suggested reading  please pass them along,1
heavily salted with good statements,Don’t waste your money. Got this based solely on the positive reviews listed- i think that those reviews were heavily salted with good statements . This stuff did nothing for my poor little congested kitty  no improvement or miracle cures as written  and by the time I realized it  the return window was closed and I’m stuck with a $50 bottle of snake oil.,0
car races,Grease. Good girl meets bad boy.... high school.... fast cars...great music you can sing along.  What's not to like??  I actually got this movie because my 5 year old grandson has recently &#34discovered&#34 musicals and I thought he would like this one with the car races.  I wasn't work.  We sing it AND dance it out.  Awesome fun. Worth owning.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful  nor do I shy away from answering comments/questions.  I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews.  My purchases are VERIFIED  FULL price and 100% independent.  As are my reviews!  They are fully my opinion  which could differ from yours - and that's ok.  Happy shopping!,1
tend to use it when I can keep my Kindle plugged in,works  but drains the battery. I purchased this for use with Kindle Fire while I am in Canada and can't access my streaming any other way... The up side is that it works really well  a bit pricy  but I use it.  The downside is that is sucks the battery down quite steadily and quickly.  I tend to use it when I can keep my Kindle plugged in. If they could work on the battery drain  it would be a five star.,1
barely any scent,Softest hands ever  lightly scented w/ lemongrass oil  lemon oil  orange oil  rosemary. I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!)  and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft  smooth  clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F)  dry day. Super moisturizing.  Oddly  I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps  and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches  nausea)  but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners)  I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass  but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil  orange oil  and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean  but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.  I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent  and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich  super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did  I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here  lol. I kinda want it as a body wash. My hands feel SO GOOD after using this. I just keep touching my hands.  One does not need a lot of soap  so feel free to just add a little to the hand. I would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down. Or if you like this soap and have a foamer  then just a wee bit of this with a lot of water will do it.  Love their designs on the bottles.  Water  Organic Coconut Oil  Organic Olive Oil  Vegetable Glycerin  Organic Guar Gum  Lemongrass Oil  Orange Oil  Organic Jojoba Oil  Lemon Oil  Rosemary Extract  Organic Aloe Vera (Potassium Hydroxide is used to saponify the organic oils into soap  but none remains in the final product),0
honest personal experience,sparkle lens covers with 'crystals' on rim. Samsung watch 4  40mm  frame covers.  I love sparkle  however  these are really rough and snag things - thus I removed it and tossed.  I wish the 'sparkle' crystal edge had been better polished and/or set in so they would not be so scratchy.  Eh.   Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes. Bottom line  I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,1
Junk,Junk. This is absolutely junk!! The bit won’t even stay in. A total waste of money. Do not buy! ,0
adorable,Improved grip. Bought this for my sister to improve her grip strength. she loves it and it's adorable too,1
have to tether it,Super cute but a bit front heavy.. It's very cute and big  however you HAVE to tether it or it won't sit up on its own. I still like it  4 stars.,0
enough to share,oil syringes. I purchased these to drip a little olive oil on my popcorn!  Easy to control portion that way.  Works just as I would like.  Easy to use and clean.  There are a lot of them  so enough to share  or store of future use.  It is plastic with a rubber (or like rubber) stoppers. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful and I hope my review was helpful to you.,1
religious agenda,Too religious. I wanted to enjoy literary essays  stories  and articles  but it seems like every issue I received this last year is packed full of a religious agenda of one variety or another.  To be sure  the themes seem to be an eclectic variety of spiritual and cultural mysticism  but the magazine never just leaves it out.  It's always a tome espousing some collection of beliefs  cultural systems  and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence using religious narratives  symbols  and sacred histories or allusions from one or another.  Everytime I read it  I feel like I'm being proselytized.,0
1 with zipper,Nice pockets and 1 with zipper. This is as close to perfect as you can get. I like having my registration and insurance right where I can get them without bending over the glove box. The world we live in nowadays and many cops are on edge  to begin with. Has a place for my sunglasses and my gas car.,1
satisfying ending,"Wonderful Music & A Gritty  Hard Life Story. One of the best things about this movie is the really good music it has  especially the vocals by a singer I never heard of before this movie.  Her name is Marideth Sisco  a homely  white-haired  rotund lady with the voice of an angel.  Hearing her singing in this movie makes it worth watching for that alone.  Other artists also contributed to the movie and they are all good.  I won't repeat the plot  which other reviewers have covered.  The biggest criticism I have seen is that this is an unfair portrayal of rural country people.  Yes and no.  I am sure there are people who are as scary and nasty as these in the country  but they are few and far between.  Just like anywhere  there are good and bad people in the country  just as in the city.  This is an entertainment movie not a documentary.  The biggest problem I have with the movie is that the actress who plays 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) in the movie seems a little too fresh faced and clean for the role.  Given the responsibility she has in the movie  you would expect her to show more signs of fatigue and despair  even at 17.  And some dirt she is always just too clean looking.  She does a good job in the role and perhaps the contrast between her purity and courage and the roughness  cowardliness and cruelty of those around her is one of the main points of the movie.  This is NOT a ""must see"" movie and is a little uncomfortable to watch at times  as some of the characters are pretty rough types.  For example  ""Teardrop""  the brother-in-law of the main character  sniffs cocaine several times during the movie.  Overall I stayed interested in seeing what was going to happen and the ending was somewhat satisfying.  If you don't want to watch the movie  buy the music soundtrack.  4 stars for the movie 5 stars for the soundtrack.",1
countries,Interesting look at different countries. Hard to get friends to play,1
color variety,Simple headbands that loosely grip my headwish there were more color variety. There are 12 headbands in this set and practically all of them look a similar shade of pastel pink  purple  and yellow. Only one headband is bold with an emerald green. I would have liked a red  black  and brown in this set. However  this appears to be designed for young girls or ballerinas who would love these colors.  I tried these on and the headbands are comfortable and do not squeeze my head. They also stay put. I have a small head so these would probably feed a youngster just fine.  The current price of $15.99 comes to a reasonable $1.33 per headband.,1
white and gold design,Great straightener for all hair types!. This is a great flat iron. I have been using irons for many years now as I love to keep my naturally wavy hair as a straightening mechanism. This Hot Tools iron is really nice. It feels well in my hand  is relatively light weight and is easy to maneuver all around my hair. And my hair looks so smooth and shiny! The iron heats up quickly and evenly and makes my hair styling go relatively fast. I also love the white and gold design  looks great on my bathroom counter. Highly recommend!,1
saffron currant braid,Sugar and spice and everything nice!. Samantha Seneviratne’s “The New Sugar and Spice” takes classic comfort bakes like cinnamon rolls  cookies  breads and cheesecake and reinvents them  using seductive hits of spice in creative and crowd-pleasing ways. In the introduction  the author points out that “the flood of sugar has diluted real flavor  muffled complexity  and concealed true richness ” so her goal was to create delicious  healthier desserts that use spices in a starring role in place of the overwhelming sweetness so prevalent in many desserts.  Chapters are divided by spices (sometimes with complementary pairings)  including peppercorn and chile  cinnamon  nutmeg  clove and cardamom  ginger  and savory herbs and spices. Along the way  Samantha includes stories about her family’s roots and how her Sri Lankan heritage influenced her culinary style  along with fascinating historical insights and storage tips on the various featured spices.  Cinnamon  hazelnut and date buns  ricotta cheesecake with bourbon-raisin jam  orange and honey baklava  orange-clove pull-apart bread  and saffron currant braid were all recipes that instantly called my name. Several years ago  I became hooked on Scandinavian baking and now tend to use cardamom liberally in yeast rolls and sweet breads (even in my morning coffee)  so naturally I was thrilled to see a whole chapter starring my favorite spice!  Measurements are given in both volume and weight (which I appreciate as I find weight measurements to be more reliable). Samantha’s guidance is spot-on there are helpful hints both for new bakers as well as experienced ones to guarantee the best results  particularly for recipes involving yeast. Gorgeous photography by Erin Kunkel highlights various ingredients and finished bakes for maximum (mouth-watering!) impact.  In addition to familiar treats  you’ll find updated versions of international classics such as profiteroles  clafoutis and tarte tatin  Scandinavian bakes like saffron currant braids and cardamom-laced shortbread  Thai banana fritters  Indonesian kue lapis  Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars that are perfect for fall  and other fragrant  delightful baked goods that spiced up my rather predictable baking repertoire. As an experienced home baker  I appreciated the challenge and loved the complexity that the various spices gave to my baked goods and will certainly be baking my way through “The New Sugar and Spice in the near future!  (I received my copy through Blogging for Books),1
no smell emanates from the bag after many hours,Great wet dry bag. I use these for transporting disposable pads. This bag has 2 compartments  so i can keep the clean ones seperate from the used. I can store about 10 pads in this bag. No smell emanates from the bag after many hours  which is great. Bag also washes well in the washing machine.,1
durable,Easy to clean!. Works perfect in the fridge. Very sturdy  durable  easy to keep clean.,1
Crosswords Plus does nearly all of the same things,"Decent  But Expensive Not Fully Functional on New Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" Tablet. CROSSWORDS by Standalone is a decent crossword puzzle app  but inflexible and expensive.  On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet  the working display shows about two-thirds of a weekday NY Times puzzle grid  and I can't find any way to resize the grid to show the whole puzzle at once. (You must swipe down or hit an arrow button to reveal the lower one-third of the grid.)  The Across and Down clues appear alongside the grid in a readable typeface  but the clues are cut off at the right.  (Perhaps this is an 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD issue that the developer will correct fortunately  clicking on a cut-off clue will display the full clue below the grid.)  The puzzle hints--found under the list icon beside the app icon  at the left--don't always work as expected.  For example  ""reveal entire puzzle"" only filled in one word (for the 1-down clue) when I started from the ""hints for 1-down"" screen.  In contrast  ""reveal entire puzzle"" filled in the entire puzzle when I started from a ""press-and-hold-on-clue"" popup.  Worse  the general settings for navigation (e.g.  ""skip filled squares""  ""show mistakes"") don't seem to function at all.  (Perhaps this is another Kindle Fire HD issue for the developer to fix.)  The app allows you to enter multiple letters in a single square  and to look up puzzle info (must-haves for NY Times crossword solvers).  If you are a NY Times crosswords subscriber  the app will automatically download the daily puzzles for you.  The app comes with an assortment of puzzles already installed  and allows you to browse for and download many more puzzles from the Internet.  It also allows you to establish an account and compare your times with other solvers.  However  the FREE [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] app does nearly all of the same things.  (Crosswords Plus does not download your NY Times subscription puzzles automatically  although it makes it easy to download them daily it doesn't come with puzzles loaded  although it points you to free Internet sources and it doesn't have a feature for comparing scores with other solvers.)  In addition  [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] allows you to resize the grid  offers an alternate clues-only view  includes the usual hints options  and has navigational settings (skipping boxes  etc.) that are fully functional on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet.  Even if this CROSSWORDS app worked perfectly  I would still prefer [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]].  For this reason  and because of the high price and current Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet issues  I rate CROSSWORDS at 3 stars.",1
packaging is simple,Two-toned delight!. These two toned faux hammered earrings are delightful. These are turquoise (smooth) and copper colored (hammered). They are hand-painted/handmade. The posts are stainless steel and nickel free. I have sensitive skin and didn’t notice any irritation or redness. While the packaging is simple  I did like that it included a “thank you” label on the box. These earrings are very classy and can be worn everyday. Overall  these are some cute earrings for under $16.,1
the other two in the series,Outstanding!. This man has become my new best author love his humor writing style&he kicksass takes no prisoner's.What a ride so if you like lot's of action lot's of kicking the bad guy's ass this book and the other two that are in the series are you ticket to a wild ride.Mr Monk pls don't stop writing the world will be very dull indeed without you!Would give 10+star's if possible.,1
easy to set up account,Primarily provides you with great peace of mind!. I suffer from a few minor health ailments (including hypertension and high cholesterol). But  more importantly  I have a bunch of allergies the most sever of which is to penicillin. I am  now in my 60's so I am thinking more of illnesses and accidents more than ever. So  when I saw this bracelet I wanted to try it. I love that it was so easy to set up my account. I also like that this is a lightweight bracelet and is sleek and attractive. This bracelet gives me peace of mind knowing in the event of an incident where I was not able to communicate  the bracelet will provide medical personnel with all the info they need to treat me. I highly recommend this to all  for the price this is a great little device.,1
more plug in options,plug extender with shelf. This is really great.  I use the shelf for my cup dispenser and my sonic toothbrush.  I have WAY more plug in options than I need... a bunch of plug ins INCLUDING USB ports!  Further  there is a night light.  It points directly at my toilet cubby so it's about perfect.  It plugged right into the wall plug and is VERY stable even without the screw (I put into a GFI  so I couldn't use the center screw).  The only negative I have to report is that the plugins are all toward the front.  I wish there was a side plug in so that the plug head of my toothbrush didn't stick straight out... Eh.  That's a small complaint  I couldn't ding a star for that cause it's kinda a personal thing.  The shelf has little grooves that was SUPER easy to slide the shelf right on.  The unit is bright white (works perfectly in my white bathroom).  To be honest  I didn't think I was gonna love this as much as I do.  Having said all that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
sturdy,Reusable christmas boxes. These are flatter reusable christmas boxes with magnetic flaps.  They are sturdy and pretty.

matches my decor perfectly,Great hair dryer gets the job done quickly!. This Jinri hair dryer is among one of the best I have ever owned. Strong and powerful  my hair dries super quick. It has varying speeds and heat levels which allows me to dry and style my hair at the same time. It also fits well in my hand  is relatively light weight  and I can maneuver from the front to back of my head easily. I love this red color as well and it matches my decor perfectly. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a new  quality hair dryer at a reasonable price.,1
magnet is not very strong,Weak Magnet. This charges a phone very quickly but that is about the only positive thing about it.  The magnet is not very strong at all.  Barely holds onto a 14 pro max with a MagSafe case on it.  Barely bumped the phone will fall.  Works a little better with a 14 mini.  The AirPod charger charges very slow even though it gets the AirPods very warm.,0
black dog on the game,My daughter loves it she's a black dog on the game. My daughter loves it good game🐶🐶🐶🐶,1
comfortable to wear in layers,Love this. I love these tops....I've now ordered 3. They are sheer which makes it more comfortable to wear in layers. For the money spent  it is a great purchase. Will probably get a couple more colors.,1
brightly colored pink,Awesome little jeep. Awesome little jeep.  It is a nice quality build.  Pretty easy to put together.  Fits a toddler great!  Easy to maneuver  except for those short turns  haha!  It holds up to 50 lbs so it can last a smaller child for years.  I could have ridden in this until I was in 6th grade  but I was a tiny child. Lots of fun and brings lots of excitement to see their very own brightly colored  pink jeep!  Be sure you have it fully charged before giving it to the child  because they will want to ride it all day!,1
easy clean-up,Must have  so handy!. I’m so happy I ordered these for all of the holiday care packages  easy clean-up  and stacking cookies!,1
powerful and complete database for really getting into the meat of any opening,"Superb Chess Database and Preparation Software. I am a longtime user of Chess Assistant  having used it since version 6.0. Chess Assistant is at its heart a database program but it is a lot more than just a database manager with a lot of chess games stored in databases - it also is a tournament preparation partner  a playing partner and top-drawer analysis tool. Compared to other commercial chess database applications available  it is a phenomenal value.  There are three editions of Chess Assistant available. The base level package is the Starter package and it is a great place to start when working with this type of application. The Professional package is similar but has additional content and has a more powerful commercial chess-playing ""engine"" included. The Mega package is the top-of-the-line offering and has even more content included. I will focus on the Professional package.  Chess Assistant includes several databases of games. The most notable is the HugeBase which includes over 5 million games. There is a Guru database which includes games from the top chess players in the world. There is also a Correspondence database that includes games between notable correspondence players. All of these databases are searchable via a number of criteria  such as player name  opening system used  date  result and more. Using the search functions  it is very easy to isolate any desired categories of games  such as all games played by a specific player in a range of dates where said player used a specific opening system.  Not all of the databases are collections of games. One database in particular is the Openings database and it is used to study opening systems. This is a powerful and complete database for really getting into the meat of any opening. It ties in with the other databases as well so following a specific line in an opening can show the percentage of wins to losses using any given line.  Where this database system really shows its power is in the functions geared towards preparation for opponents. With a single menu item selection all of the games by a specific player can be pulled from a database with a breakdown of openings used and the success rate of those openings against the player being researched. Professional players will find this to be invaluable - in short order this functionality can quickly expose an opponent's soft spots.  Chess Assistant does a lot more than manage databases of chess games. It includes several chess playing engines that can be used for sparring. And  because of built-in support for WinBoard and UCI protocols  adding other engines is easy to so that almost all of the available chess engines for download on the Internet can be linked in and used for playing  either against a human opponent or against each other.  Engines that are linked in can be used for analyzing games as well.  Once a game is in one of the databases  there are functions for performing game analysis that provide a quick and complete automatic analysis of said game with minimal interaction from the user. Analysis can be based on the amount of time the engine is allowed to use or the depth to which the engine should search (depth being in ""ply""  or half-moves). Analyzed games are automatically annotated by the engine and additional annotations can be made by the user.  The Professional package includes Houdini 3 Pro  currently the strongest chess playing engine available in the world. (The Starter package includes Houdini 3  not Houdini 3 Pro). Houdini is powerful enough that it will cruch all opponents (including the world champion) with ease so it is not the best choice for a sparring partner unless you want to expose weaknesses in your game with clinical precision. Where Houdini shows its value is actually in game analysis  where it can find even the most subtle advantages and explain where errors occurred that other engines cannot see.  Another nice feature included in Chess Assistant is an interface to the Internet Chess Club (ICC)  where one can watch games  play and interact with other players. There is limited guest access  so be aware than not all functions are available to non-subscribers.  Chess Assistant's user interface has remained relatively unchanged over the several years I have been using it and its the one criticism I have of the application. Though many functions are grouped appropriately  there are a few cases where finding a specific setting requires a but of hunting through menu selections and dialog boxes. Also  I dislike some of the default settings as well  one example being that engines are given only a small amount of memory for hash tables which limits their strength. These are nitpicks and can be worked around but are worth mention.  Chess Assistant is a powerful and fairly complete chess application  combining database functionality with the ability to link in chess playing/analysis engines. It is the one chess application I use consistently and in my opinion is worth every penny. If you need a chess database application  Chess Assistant is probably the best value available.",1
lack of overall cohesiveness compared to Tension and the Spark,"Darren truly comes into his own as a solo artist on TDTWM. Darren Hayes  former multiplatinum-selling frontman for Aussie duo Savage Garden ([[ASIN:B000BUXUUG Truly  Madly  Completely- The Best of Savage Garden]])  has come into his own on This Delicate Thing We've Made. It's been a whirlwind few years for Hayes: on his third solo album after [[ASIN:B0000630UH Spin]] (2002) and [[ASIN:B0002QCBE0 The Tension And The Spark]] (2005)  Darren parted ways with Sony  started his own label Powdered Sugar  and married his partner Richard Cullen in a civil ceremony in London.  As one review rightly pointed out  if Hayes was still attached to Sony / Columbia  no megaconglomerate record company would have ever financed anything as ambitious and hard to categorize as This Delicate Thing We've Made. Spanning 25 tracks on 2 CDs  the album is all over the place sonically in a tribute to some of Darren's idols  including Prince  Michael Jackson  and Kate Bush  and the authentic retro vibe is courtesy of a 1983 Fairlight CMI syth. Darren's earlier collaborations with Robert Conley on Spin (Crush (1980 Me) and Tension and the Spark continue on TDTWM  along with Justin Shave as producer (Justin played keyboards on Darren's Big Night In tour).  Even though there is a unifying theme of time travel  Darren's bouncing off the sonic walls  from funk to electro to boy band to uniquely Darren. Unexpected samples (barking dogs  airplanes  horses) crop up in the middle of songs  and two songs (Conversations with God and Neverland) strongly remind me of Tori Amos-influenced Casey Stratton ([[ASIN:B00016XO56 Standing at the Edge]])  who shares the same soaring falsetto and sense of lyrical drama.  My main issue is the balance between uptempo flirtations with electronica (club hit Step Into the Light  Casey  Listen All You People  Me  Myself  and I) and slower ballads  which make up most of the second disc. I feel that TDTWM lacks the overall cohesiveness of Tension and the Spark  and I find myself skipping over a few of the tracks (the aforementioned Bombs Up In My Face and the dark  gritty Setting Sun). However  TDTWM grows on me with each successive listen. It's such a nuanced  complex work that multiple listens are required to do Darren's creative vision justice. As with previous releases  there are several B-sides available exclusively  on the TDTWM singles [[ASIN:B000SFYGXY On the Verge of Something Wonderful]]  [[ASIN:B000SFZ05M On the Verge of Something Wonderful  Vol. 2]]  and [[ASIN:B000SN3VNM On the Verge of Something Wonderful]]: Step Into the Light remixes  Fallen Angel  and I Just Want You To Love Me  as well as a ""bootleg"" digital single available on Darren's official website (www dot darrenhayes.dloadshop.com/shop.asp?arid=2 ) that features God Is In The Room and Ocean.  Kudos to Darren for the creative  pass-the-good-karma origami bird marketing that ties in with TDTWM's theme.

fantastic smell,Fantastic!. I bought this for a great nice for a gift and she loved it. Smell fantastic as well as moisturizing? Great price!,1
strong garlic flavor,handy and so easy to use. I have IBS and my gastro doc has instructed me to do the FODMAP diet for 8 weeks.  Very  very frustrating diet.  So much you cannot eat that seems strange.  One thing is garlic.  Used in pretty much EVERYTHING you buy.  However  you ARE allowed to use garlic &#34infused&#34 oil... So  I decided to try this to help with the lack of salad dressing and on other foods.  I actually carry it in my purse because I eat out fairly often.  So I ask for some balsamic vinegar and use a couple of sprays of this garlic infused oil.  Quite tasty and easy.  So... you can make your own garlic infused oil  but it will only keep for about 1 week according to the recipe.  I wanted something less smelly to make (the smell will last in your kitchen for days making your own)  and something that would last a bit longer.  This oil is NOT for cooking... it is a &#34finishing&#34 spray... meaning you put it on food AFTER it is cooked or on salad or other cooked/raw foods. Taste is very personal  however  for me  it has a very strong garlic flavor.  Not overly so  but definitely there. It is satisfying.  Honestly  I may keep using it after my weird FODMAP diet days are over.  I was not able to find this anywhere locally so I am once again thankful to Amazon for bringing the world to my front door.  I always update with any useful info if that comes up.,1
Easy to Assemble,Easy to Assemble. I was a little alarmed when I first opened this and saw that they were not assembled. However  assembly was easy and I didn't even have to read the instruction booklet to do so. I am using this toothbrush holder directly on the counter without the adhesive. When I ordered it  I didn't even notice that it was intended to stick on the wall. It's doing fine on the counter. It keeps my sonic toothbrush upright better than it was doing on its own. There are 2 toothbrush holders in this set.,1
easy for the baby to grab and hold onto,"Excellent infant teether with gum massaging nubs drop resistant. There is one BPA-free silicone teether in this package. The silicone is super soft. I consider this cute and engaging. This is easy for the baby to grab and hold onto. It has no sharp edges or parts that can fall off. This is perfect as a teether and is one solid piece. I also love that the ears have nubs which act as a gum massaging / tooth cleaning ""tool."" As is typical  always supervise when the baby is using this. This is rated for 0 to 12 months.  This is made in China. The current price of $6.29 ($6.99 minus 10%) is competitively priced for this. Overall  I consider this a great teether that is drop resistant and small enough for newborns. I had given one like this to my neighbor's infant and he absolutely loved it.",1
great price,A must-have for your earthquake kit!. These are great! I bought them for our earthquake kits and will buy more! In case there's a big one and aftershocks  have this handy in case of more falling objects. Great price as well. Took a few minutes to figure out the straps to put them together- then it was a breeze-  very happy with this purchase.,1
fits in my shoe perfectly,These are the best lower back pain relief insoles around!. I am on my feet all day with my job and I tend to wear some kind of heel (whether it's a wedge or a 2 inch heel). I need support and cushioning or  by the end of the day  I have terrible lower back and heel pain. I found these Pain Relief Orthotics earlier this year and I am so glad I did. Light weight  fits in my shoe perfectly for my size 9 feet  and definitely makes a major difference by the end of the day in the way my back feels. I am sure I will never be able to get rid of all the pain  but with these Dr. Scholl's insoles  I feel refreshed and not like I used to. I highly recommend these for any one on their feet (waitresses  bartenders  sales associates  etc) and I know your feet (and back) will thank you.,1
look nice,Nice Cotton Boxer Briefs. These have nearly everything I look for in boxer briefs.  They are tagless  comfortable  nice fitting  and look nice.  The only thing that is missing is a fly hole which is a bit annoying  but forgiveable if everything else is good.  And everything else is good.  I have put two through the wash and they look good and given the quality feel of them  I would expect that they will last well.,1
bully stick,Great Variety of Items to Try. The package arrived well before Christmas and my dog insisted on immediately sampling. Here is what I remember being in the pack for to 20-50lb size dog. 1 pkg of 2 meaty knee cap bones (VERY messy and greasy)   2 pig snouts  1 puffed sow ear  1 peanut butter filled bone  two beef tendons  two braided esaphogus  I think there may have been a bully stick or two in there as well.  When it arrived I didn't think it was much  but it has lasted us for quite a while.  So far everything has been a hit with my dog and it was nice to try some new treats without having to make the decision of what to buy and being able to see what she likes.  I figured it was about $30-35 worth of product and I'll try for another month to see what comes in the next box. I always buy my cow ears from pawstruck and appreciate that you know where the products come from (country of origin) that they are safe and don't have all kinds of chemical additives,1
needed under the headrests of my new car,Great Neck Cushion. Soft and comfortable.  These are just what I needed under the headrests of my new car.  I have no idea why head rests now come sort of tilted forward  and in my particular car (Toyota Corolla) there is no way to tilt them back.  It feels like my head is being forced forward.  So  these pillows are the perfect touch to give my neck the needed cushion while I'm driving or as a passenger.  They're the perfect firmness  not too soft and not too firm.,1
disappointed,Nice  but don't expect a snow globe!. Was disappointed when I had to reorder it because it got lost then itcame(the 1st one) so I had to send it back. Was also disappointed because I thought it was a real snow globe. Should have read up on it. My fault.,0
Cinnamon,Sugar and spice and everything nice!. Samantha Seneviratne’s “The New Sugar and Spice” takes classic comfort bakes like cinnamon rolls  cookies  breads and cheesecake and reinvents them  using seductive hits of spice in creative and crowd-pleasing ways. In the introduction  the author points out that “the flood of sugar has diluted real flavor  muffled complexity  and concealed true richness ” so her goal was to create delicious  healthier desserts that use spices in a starring role in place of the overwhelming sweetness so prevalent in many desserts.  Chapters are divided by spices (sometimes with complementary pairings)  including peppercorn and chile  cinnamon  nutmeg  clove and cardamom  ginger  and savory herbs and spices. Along the way  Samantha includes stories about her family’s roots and how her Sri Lankan heritage influenced her culinary style  along with fascinating historical insights and storage tips on the various featured spices.  Cinnamon  hazelnut and date buns  ricotta cheesecake with bourbon-raisin jam  orange and honey baklava  orange-clove pull-apart bread  and saffron currant braid were all recipes that instantly called my name. Several years ago  I became hooked on Scandinavian baking and now tend to use cardamom liberally in yeast rolls and sweet breads (even in my morning coffee)  so naturally I was thrilled to see a whole chapter starring my favorite spice!  Measurements are given in both volume and weight (which I appreciate as I find weight measurements to be more reliable). Samantha’s guidance is spot-on there are helpful hints both for new bakers as well as experienced ones to guarantee the best results  particularly for recipes involving yeast. Gorgeous photography by Erin Kunkel highlights various ingredients and finished bakes for maximum (mouth-watering!) impact.  In addition to familiar treats  you’ll find updated versions of international classics such as profiteroles  clafoutis and tarte tatin  Scandinavian bakes like saffron currant braids and cardamom-laced shortbread  Thai banana fritters  Indonesian kue lapis  Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars that are perfect for fall  and other fragrant  delightful baked goods that spiced up my rather predictable baking repertoire. As an experienced home baker  I appreciated the challenge and loved the complexity that the various spices gave to my baked goods and will certainly be baking my way through “The New Sugar and Spice in the near future!  (I received my copy through Blogging for Books),1
hard to find items,this is a fun game  some items are really hard to find. this is a fun game  some items are really hard to find but thats the challenge..lol what I dont like is the rest of it you have to build cities read about the people and help them...I just want to find the items not all the rest..good graphics too.,1
shrinks up when not in use and is pretty compact,Nice hose  good value. Great hose  good value for the money. The 75ft length is super helpful for getting those far areas but it shrinks up when not in use and is pretty compact.,0
"""hit 'Sugar Town'""","Wonderful Fun. These are mostly moldy-oldies of course  but Nancy puts a lot pizazz into these songs.  This is jazzy  bouncy fun.  The band is great too  but never overpowering.  There is some humor here too in a couple of the songs.  This is just a rollicking good time and succeeds in many ways.  Probably somewhat different than most of Nancy's stuff.  Worth it alone for the hit ""Sugar Town"" and the bonus track of ""Something Stupid""  which is also a great song (duet with her father).  The pink bikini picture is another plus  but I would have bought this album even with a plain white cover.",1
nice,smaller than expected and color was wrong both times I ordered. Nice  but smaller than expected and both times they sent wrong color ordered gold and got white  ordered again and got blue labels,1
adjustments for each plant,Great. Great product  really helps me to know what the PH level of my soil is so I can make adjustments for each plant. Also  very useful for determining soil moisture levels so I don't over water or let the plants dry too much.,1
smells wonderful,Smells wonderful. AND anti bacterial too!,1
enjoys painting,Better Than Using a Paper Plate!. My daughter enjoys painting in her free time. She uses acrylic paint that comes in little tubes and likes to blend her own colors. I ordered this for her because she was using a paper plate for her paints and this looked like it would be easier to use. It also keeps the paints separate and not touching accidently. It cleans up pretty easily  too.,1
control it in the shower,Great way to scrub and exfoliate!. I have been using scrubs in the shower for the past few years. I have really dry  crepey skin and scrubs really help. I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw these cubes  couldn't figure out if I would be able to control it in the shower (trying to get it onto my legs and arms). I was pleasantly surprised  however  to see how easy it was.  As I begin to use it the cube stays in the palm of my hand and begins to 'melt' slowly as I moved it up and down my arms and legs. There was plenty to go around and it was super easy to use. My skin felt amazing after just one use. I really did like the fragrance  too. I will be buying a few more of these for myself and also as stocking stuffers for my two daughter-in-laws (a unique gift). Highly recommend!,1
sweet potato wontons,“There is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”. Susie Fishbein’s bestselling series “Kosher By Design” goes out with a bang with the final ninth volume “Kosher By Design Brings It Home.” Inspired by Susie’s travels to France  Italy  Mexico  Israel  and North America  you’ll find kosher versions of favorites such as Korean short ribs  lasagna bolognaise  and shoyu tamago ramen (which normally has a pork-based broth here in Japan).  I have several kosher cookbooks that I cook from regularly (Including The Joy of Kosher and “The New Kosher”)  but this was my first experience with the “Kosher By Design” series.  The menu leans most heavily towards Israeli and Italian dishes  including staples like arancini (fried stuffed risotto)   ravioli  Tuscan bean and farro soup  veal scallopini  brachiole  (fried) pizza Napolitana  ragu Napolitano  and lasagna  but you’ll also find Asian-inspired dishes (short ribs  spicy kim chee hangar steaks   ramen  chicken adobo) and Latin flair in the form of chicken flautas  ceviche  and pulled beef tacos.  The salads and dairy / fish sections were particular favorites of mine. I love light  refreshing salads for nearly every meal  and the Israeli-inspired salads here are perfect for hot  hazy days when you don’t feel like spending hours at the stove. I loved the Provencal wheatberry salad  Lumina market salad  Carmel Spa pomegranate almond salad (I use pomegranate molasses as a salad dressing and was happy to see it in a recipe!)  kale squash Caesar salad  root vegetable apple salad  and Chedva’s warm French potato salad was a revelation: baby potatoes  haricots verts  and a tangy white wine-herb dressing made this memorable (to make it dairy  you can add crumbled feta while warm).  Poultry includes rosemary lavender chicken  Amalfi sage chicken  and mustard caper chicken  and the meat dishes include various roasts  grills  and stews: pumpkin braised short ribs are perfect for fall  while the lamb cholent “cassoulet” reminded me of my trip to France’s Perigord in 2012. Dairy dishes include decadent bread pudding  farroto  pasta frittata  and risotto  while the fish dishes really shone: I loved the silan-glazed salmon (see photo) and the showstopping citrus-glazed salmon  layered with rows of perfectly symmetrical cucumber slices atop a citrus mayo. I also enjoyed trying my hand at the khachapuri shakshuka having taught many students from Georgia  I’d long heard of the magic of khachapuri but had never tried making it before. Susie’s clear instructions (and the easy shakshuka topping save the extra for omelettes and scrambled eggs!) make this a winner for breakfast or brunch.  Vegetarians have many options in the sides chapter  including a beautiful (and deceptively simple) eggplant and tomato tart (see photo)  tershi and couscous (I’m a fan of all things pumpkin and had not heard / tried this amazing Libyan Jewish dish before)  sweet potato wontons with teriyaki dipping sauce  chestnut tomato quinoa  and freekeh pilaf. Desserts are sure to tempt with a delightfully sweet/tart lemon tiramisu  Beresheet Spa Kanafe  banana  date  and pecan cake  almond bobka ring  halvah baklava  and fudgy New Fishbein Brownies punched up with espresso powder. Recipes are clearly labeled as meat  dairy or pareve (with some having multiple options depending on dairy-free substitutions) using color-coded icons. Note that some spellings use the Hebrew / Ashkenazi variations (chummos for hummus  seviche for ceviche  bobka for babka  etc.). I love that the font is a little larger and easily readable from several feet away as I tend to cook using a cookbook holder (and the ingredients are handily in bold). Each recipe comes with a full-page photo by John Uher showcasing each dish. The recipes (main dishes in particular) tend to be more elegant / upscale than some of my other kosher cookbooks (dishes like dried fruit and quinoa stuffed capons  turkey breast with hoisin tangerine glaze  and pumpkin braised short ribs would all make wonderful holiday centerpieces)  but there are also plenty of recipes that come together quickly for weeknight meals (the eggplant and tomato tart  fish dishes  and veggie sides).  Overall  “Kosher by Design Brings It Home” is a wonderful finale to Susie’s best-selling series (with nearly 500 000 books sold) and a great way to taste the world from the comfort of your (kosher) kitchen Susie’s headnotes introduce the reader to places and people she’s encountered on her fifteen-year culinary journey spanning several continents and multiple food traditions  from Italian nonnas to Yemenite family recipes passed down across generations. But at the end of the day  in Susie’s words  “there is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”  (Thank you to the Trina Kaye Organization for the review copy!),1
jump,cats  love it. bought  a  year  ago   it  is  cardboard   but  wonderful for  cats  with  or  without claws   they  rest  on  it  jump   etc.  A  great  purchase.  You  will  be  happy,1
not for outdoor use,Big  loose and comfy. Not sure what I thought I was getting  but I wouldn't use these for outdoor (or even in the gym) use. They are super comfortable  baggy/loose and are great for sleeping or just lounging around the house. I don't like the waist band  found it keeps rolling down when I wear them (have to keep pulling them up). I think they are soft and comfy  but not for me for yoga or any other type of sport (unless I am going to use them in my home).,0
bag of very rusty bells,If you want rust powder covered bells  look no further. I got exactly what was described. A bag of very rusty bells  stars  and twine. What a mess!,0
palm oil,fresh and soft. These are subtle licorice pieces. There are pieces that are predominately coconut. I like them.  My bag arrived with a distant &#34use by date&#34 and was soft and fresh. For me  I am so happy to read the ingredient list.  No red dye #40 or yellow #5 or 6.  Here is the ingredient list on the bag: Sugar  cane molasses  wheat flour  glucose syrup (contains sulphites)  desiccated coconut  palm oil  beef gelatin  corn starch  glycerol  natural colors (plain caramel  beetroot red  curcumin  paprika). fat reduced cocoa  licorice exctract  natural flavorings (aniseed  lemon  raspberry  vanilla  orange) glazing agent (beeswax) fruit and vegetable juices for coloring. Allergy alert: equipment shared with products that include peanuts  tree nuts  milk  egg  soy and wheat. NOT a health food.  But a delightful treat without harmful dyes still legal in the USA.,1
so awesome,Great Replacement for Shoe Strings!. OMG I love these!!!  I tested them out on my tennis shoes and they're so awesome.  I am so thrilled to never have to tie my tennis shoes again because they would always come untied while I was walking.  I am going to buy my husband a pair of these for his sneakers  too!  In Love with the Hickies!,1
fits well,Fits well.. Like the color. Use for a Maverick XLT 2022.,1
"<span class=""neg"">designed for young girls or ballerinas</span>",Simple headbands that loosely grip my headwish there were more color variety. There are 12 headbands in this set and practically all of them look a similar shade of pastel pink  purple  and yellow. Only one headband is bold with an emerald green. I would have liked a red  black  and brown in this set. However  this appears to be designed for young girls or ballerinas who would love these colors.  I tried these on and the headbands are comfortable and do not squeeze my head. They also stay put. I have a small head so these would probably feed a youngster just fine.  The current price of $15.99 comes to a reasonable $1.33 per headband.,0
smaller than the original towelettes,Five stars. These towelette are smaller than the original towelettes.  However  they do a great job of cleaning and treating my windshield.,0
water and fade resistant,dining room chair cushions. I have some very  very hard wood dining room chairs.  They have very large seats.  I have been looking for cushions that would fit for months.  Now.  As you can see by the pics I have provided  they do not go all the way to the end of the seat portion of the chair.  However  we you sit on them  the cushion &#34spreads&#34 to the edge  so you don't feel the edge of the chair.  They are approximately 1 1/2&#34 to 2&#34 thick. They are just enough cushioning.  The blue is a sort of a turquoise... definitely not a marine blue  - I think the pic I provided pretty accurately shows the color.  The only other color option was a green.  I do wish there had been a more neutral color option... a dark tan... a chocolate brown?  I do think you could turn the cushions over.  The ties are sewn well and strong.  The design is sort of quilted in look and in texture - it is the same on both sides. The tags say &#34made in the USA with imported/USA materials.&#34  As for cleaning.. it says spot cleaning only. Fill and cover are listed as 100% polyester.  I do like that they are water and fade resistant.  Even though I am using them inside  perhaps they will stand up to little more use. I never hesitate to update my review should new info seem useful.,1

bright and colorful,paper flower bouquet. I purchased this for my mom who is at a distance with the Covid rules... It is a beautiful display and folds flat so she is going to keep it.  Win/Win!  Bright and colorful.  I even survived the mail system.,1
valuable resource for writers,A consistently excellent resource for writers. I have subscribed to Writer's Digest for decades. It is a consistently valuable resource for writers of both fiction and nonfiction. Rather than resting on its laurels as a leader in the field of writer education  WD is constantly updating its offerings. Its content is useful not just for beginning writers  but provides insights that veteran writers can profit from as well.  A big benefit of subscription is access to substantial resources on the WD website. They offer free articles for every genre imaginable  editor blogs  writing competitions  forums  opportunities to join online critique groups and receive peer reviews  and much more.  One thing WD does not offer subscribers  however  is access to current and past issues on their website  unlike most other magazines do these days. This is quite unfortunate  as it can be very useful to have a PDF of a magazine article one wants to clip and save without having to go to the trouble of scanning it oneself.,1
fall hazard,A slipping hazard. The shoe top fabric is nice but the bottom is made of some kind of plastic that reminds me of the wheels on a big wheel.  They are a fall hazard.  I wouldn't even donate them so as not to bring that on anyone else.  I actually threw them out and will be more careful in future orders.,0

variety,Good assortment. Good variety,1
hits and nothing but the hits,The one single-disc Billy Joel hits set you really need. Hands down  far and away  this is the best single-disc Billy Joel collection you're going to find.  Anywhere  anytime.  The Hits is aptly named:  The hits and nothing but the hits  all killer and no filler.  Will it miss a favorite or two of yours?  Very likely.  Will it still pack an amazing musical bang for your buck?  Absolutely!  The ideal collection for the casual fan who doesn't care to collect a lot of albums and non-hits.  Also  an ideal set for the bigtime fan who wants a single hits disc for when they have a sudden urge to get into Billy's big ones  and nothing but the big ones.  A full Five Stars and very highly recommended.,1
phones sit in the chargers,"nice set. id give it 5 stars except i dont like how the phones sit in the chargers  they lean forward instead of backward including the base  i hope these live longer than my last set  i lost display on each of them  by dropping them  people drop things panasonic  you should make them a bit more sturdy and i know they have a ""rugged""  one but 60 for one handset is a bit ridiculous too",0
figure out the straps,A must-have for your earthquake kit!. These are great! I bought them for our earthquake kits and will buy more! In case there's a big one and aftershocks  have this handy in case of more falling objects. Great price as well. Took a few minutes to figure out the straps to put them together- then it was a breeze-  very happy with this purchase.,0
flimsy skirt,Harem waist. I liked the heavier material its not a flimsy skirt.,0
Love this Pizza place,Love this Pizza place. This is a great pizza place,1
Dr. Pen,Great microneedling pen for at home use!. I typically go for microderms and facials several times a month and it can add up money-wise. I have gotten microneedling facials done in the past and they typically run about $100-150 for a good one. I noticed that the last one I had received earlier this year  the spa tech was using a Dr. Pen. So  when I saw this  I wondered how easy it would be to try to do this myself. I was so surprised to see it was easy! In spite of the fact that it is a little uncomfortable with the deeper settings  I knew that I was going to see a noticeable improvement. After using this three times in the last two months  I can vouch for how great (and young) my skin looks. I do need to use some aloe vera after use (to keep the redness down). The results are just as good (if not better) than doing it in a spa setting. Highly recommend!,1

plastic seems a little flimsy,Works well. The Lampelc Headset Charging Dock was easy to put together. Plastic seems a little flimsy but it's doing a good job holding the headset and controllers. I have two Oculus Quest 2 sets so I had headsets  controllers and charging cables all over the place. This stand keeps everything together and it looks nice. I love how the green light lets me know when the headset is fully charged.,0
pleasant,Light Floral Scent. This fragrance has a light floral scent. I normally don't like floral scents  but this one is pleasant. The petals are a great way to try out scents. The towelettes are basically one time use. They're not wet and overly saturated  but they do transfer the fragrance to wherever you wipe them. These are perfect for traveling! I'm putting  a few of these in my 19 year old daughter's stocking this Christmas!,1
wouldn’t want to use for quality music listening,Great value gaming headset. These really look great. My 9 year old loves to play fortenite with these. They seem to be built tough but with kids nothing is safe. The sound quality works for video games but wouldn’t want to use the for quality music listening. These are a steal for the price if your look for a value gaming headset with a cool look. Mic works well and it comes with a splitter adapter for separate mic and input sound.,0
first is one of the best,Pirates of the Caribbean 4 set. I am HUGE Pirates fan AND a Johnny Depp fan... so double bonus for me.  You have to own all 4 if you're going to watch them. Each one good in it's own way.  Clearly the first is one of the best.  However  I personally love the last of the 4 so far.  I love the mermaids.  Oooo.  Watch out guys.  In any case... I would say ok for age 8 and up... but that is a personal thought... to each their own I don't judge.,1
nostalgic walk down a snowy memory lane,"Retro-inspired country Christmas is a walk down memory lane.... ""The Farm Chicks Christmas"" by Serena Thompson is the follow-up to 2009's [[ASIN:1588168662 The Farm Chicks in the Kitchen: Live Well  Laugh Often  Cook Much]]. The first Farm Chicks book was a countrified cookbook peppered liberally with stories and reminiscences by Serena and Teri  antiques-inspired craft ideas (a reusable stencil was included in the front)  and comfort food: easy recipes for breakfast treats  appetizers  soups and salads  and decadent desserts  over fifty in all.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas "" on the other hand  is written only by Serena  a contributing editor for Country Living magazine and antiques show hostess (her best friend Teri has retired from their business). The book still includes numerous country-inspired craft ideas you'll find decorative  retro-inspired self-adhesive gift tags and notecards at the back  along with various decorating ideas for ""the most wonderful time of the year."" However  the ratio of crafts to recipes is reversed from the first book there are only 17 recipes included at the back with gift-giving suggestions on how to package them.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" captures the magic of childhood Christmases  from family visits to the tree farm (complete with recipe ideas for hot drinks to tote along)  holiday decorating ideas (holiday scalloped bunting  vintage-inspired snowball pompom ornaments  cone trees and vintage funnel trees  banners and more)  and photos of Serena's friends' and family's homes decorated for Christmas.  Much of the book is more like a scrapbooked photo essay  with crafts sprinkled in every few pages. Also  the decorating tips (and included photos) are vintage country in the Farm Chicks fashion: displaying old farm toys standing in coconut snow  for example  or stacking metal funnels to make ""trees."" If you're not a fan of all things country  this probably isn't the holiday book for you.  The included holiday recipes are few  and aimed mostly at gift-giving  like the sweet and salty nuts  mini orange bundt cakes  and various types of cookies (butter cutouts  chocolate-covered peanut butter balls  snowballs  Spritz cookies). As with the previous book  a handy list of metric equivalent charts is provided at the back. I tried the sweet and salty nuts recipe first  and though tasty  I didn't think that the ""sweet"" flavor predominated it was more of a subtle afterthought (there's only 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of honey for 3 cups of nuts).  Overall  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" is a nostalgic walk down a snowy memory lane  but it has narrower mass appeal than ""Farm Chicks in the Kitchen"" due to the reversal of the recipe-to-crafts ratio and the genre-specific decorating style (I enjoyed the many beautiful photographs  but won't find myself making yarn-ball wreaths or filling jars with spare Christmas lightbulbs anytime soon).

Fast shipping,Five Stars. Great deal  sounds terrific. Fast shipping,1
helped make the mixing easier,flex edge beater kitchenaid. Love love love this beater.  I have a 4.5 quart tilt head kitchenaid  model KSM85PBSM.  Fit and worked perfectly through the holiday cookie season. It really helped make the mixing easier  more thorough.  Easy to clean.  If you own a kitchenaid  you need this beater!  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
easy to read,Handy to have. This is handy to have in your glove box When you need to check your tire pressure. Very easy to attach to the valve stem and easy to read,1
reasonable price,Just a lovely clean masculine fragrance that smells like a good soap. I use essential oils in my diffusers and this sandalwood essential oil is perfect for that. This is also great for those who make body butters or other lotions.  The fragrance is  clean and masculine and smells like a good soap. I use anywhere from 3 - 5 drops in my diffuser depending on the size of my water reservoir. The resulting aroma is lovely.  The current price of $15.99 for this large 3.38 fluid ounce bottle is reasonable as it comes to less than $5 per ounce.,1
smooth surface,It's pretty. Love the clearly printed photo  smooth surface  and standard size fit. Cons  hardware on these style seats is not the best  it works  and there are a couple of almost sharp edges I've found on the inside bottom of the seat opening.,1
Highly recommended,High quality paper and printing. Highly recommended! Graphic 45 never disappoints. With their delux kits you get extra embellishments,1
eyelashes come back faster,Help your eyelashes come back faster will let you know how it works after 8 weeks. I was going to return one but it takes 6 to 8 weeks to notice a difference and I do want to have Fuller eyelashes and eyebrows so I'm going to give it a chance even though it was a little pricey my eyelashes deserve it,1
bimonthly subscription,Amazing customer service and cats are obsessed.. I recommend the “without treats” subscription as you get an extra toy. So far my cats are obsessed with at least one toy from each box we’ve received. The others are still appreciated. They're always based around a cool theme and there is one wand toy included each month. At least a couple are manufactured in the US (maybe handmade?). They seem pretty high-quality overall. I’ve gotten two boxes so far and love that meowbox offers a bimonthly subscription through the website. Meowbox also has amazing customer service.,1
use by date,fresh and soft. These are subtle licorice pieces. There are pieces that are predominately coconut. I like them.  My bag arrived with a distant &#34use by date&#34 and was soft and fresh. For me  I am so happy to read the ingredient list.  No red dye #40 or yellow #5 or 6.  Here is the ingredient list on the bag: Sugar  cane molasses  wheat flour  glucose syrup (contains sulphites)  desiccated coconut  palm oil  beef gelatin  corn starch  glycerol  natural colors (plain caramel  beetroot red  curcumin  paprika). fat reduced cocoa  licorice exctract  natural flavorings (aniseed  lemon  raspberry  vanilla  orange) glazing agent (beeswax) fruit and vegetable juices for coloring. Allergy alert: equipment shared with products that include peanuts  tree nuts  milk  egg  soy and wheat. NOT a health food.  But a delightful treat without harmful dyes still legal in the USA.,1
Her character ages rapidly both physically and psychologically,"Fans of Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Somewhere in Time will adore Portrait of Jennie. Jennifer Jones ([[ASIN:B00008LDO7 The Song of Bernadette]]) and Joseph Cotten star in Portrait of Jennie  a 1948 film that revolved around a painter's obsession with a beautiful  mysterious girl who seems to live more in the past than the present. Eben Adams (Cotten) is a washed-up painter on hard times and lacks inspiration until he meets Jennie (Jones) in a New York park. Jennie has an unusual way of speaking about past events as though they are current (referring to Germany's kaiser  and to theaters that had been demolished). Her fresh-faced beauty appeals to Adams  and Jennie makes the wish that he wait for her to grow up so that they can be together.  Jennie's sporadic appearances allow time for Eben to work on other commissions  and to research Jennie more carefully by interviewing people who had worked with her parents (famous high-wire circus performers). Inevitably  dark truths are uncovered that disturb Eben's ""painting-perfect"" romance with the soft-spoken  beautiful Jennie. His portrait of her is a testament to his love and brings him artistic fame. Eben is also introduced to Miss Spinney (Ethel Barrymore)  a headstrong old maid who deals in paintings and who wants to see Eben produce something more spiritual. Other notable names include Lillian Gish as Mother Mary of Mercy  Cecil Kellaway as Matthews  and a young Nancy Davis Reagan in the art gallery.  Joseph Cotten is an engaging narrator  and his growing dependence on Jennie and his depression over Jennie's long absences is utterly believable (if a bit melodramatic). Jennifer Jones has more to work with here than in her first Oscar-winning role as Bernadette  although seeing a well-proportioned twentysomething trying to portray prepubescent innocence was a little bit creepy (see: Judy Garland in [[ASIN:B000ADS63K The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]). Her character ages rapidly both physically and psychologically  so Jones was able to display a range of emotions  from a childhood crush to deeper musings on the nature of love and faith. Some of the secondary characters suffer from disappearing Irish accents others shamelessly (sometimes woodenly) overact.  The film follows several conventions of its time  and appears dated. The ""special effects"" are pretty standard several scale models are used and a green tint is used for the final scenes. There are some beautifully dreamy shots of New York City  and the fabulous effect of having shots appear as though they were painted on canvas. The DVD transfer features some artifacts and print flaws. There are no extras to speak of. However  fans of time-travel romances [[ASIN:B000083C6R The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]]and [[ASIN:B00004W46I Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)]] will enjoy Portrait of Jennie  although the strongest film of this genre is undoubtedly The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. Despite its shortcomings  Portrait of Jennie is a pretty decent love story.",1
scripted,A great career while it lasted. Finally settled in last night to watch this movie. Let me start by saying that I love a good mystery and that I usually enjoy these kind of movies. Not much more can I say that hasn't been said before. First  the acting was absolutely awful. The movie is so scripted  it's almost as if the actors are reading their lines. The roles and characters are more than predictable (i.e. you have all token nationalities in the 'bad guy' gang  so they are equal opportunity offenders). I found most of the action in the fight scenes to be totally absurd. I could no more see Kim B. slinging a tire iron at someone (and getting it lodged in the victim's nostrils) then my mother doing it. It was almost comical. The underlying piece of Kim's marriage to an abusive man  was also ridiculously scripted and acted (damn  if any housewife kept a house as dirty and junk filled as she did  who wouldn't be yelling at her from time to time?). Anyway  just reliving this movie to write this review is painful. The movie was like a bad Saturday Night Live/MadTV skit. Run  don't walk  from buying or even renting this one.,0
fabulous,Love these they are amazing. These are fabulous I keep my cats food in one and treats in another both stay very fresh I've had her treats for 3 months and they are still soft they're easy to open easy to shut they are perfect I'm thinking of buying some to store my own food,1
wrist is starting to hurt,Pretty good mouse  works well but not really good for smaller girl hands. This mouse is unfortunately too big for my hands.  I wear a small to medium in gloves in women's sizing.  I love the mouse but am finding it too uncomfortable to use and my wrist is starting to hurt.  On the hunt again for a mouse that fits my hands.,0
working display shows about two-thirds of a weekday NY Times puzzle grid,"Decent  But Expensive Not Fully Functional on New Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" Tablet. CROSSWORDS by Standalone is a decent crossword puzzle app  but inflexible and expensive.  On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet  the working display shows about two-thirds of a weekday NY Times puzzle grid  and I can't find any way to resize the grid to show the whole puzzle at once. (You must swipe down or hit an arrow button to reveal the lower one-third of the grid.)  The Across and Down clues appear alongside the grid in a readable typeface  but the clues are cut off at the right.  (Perhaps this is an 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD issue that the developer will correct fortunately  clicking on a cut-off clue will display the full clue below the grid.)  The puzzle hints--found under the list icon beside the app icon  at the left--don't always work as expected.  For example  ""reveal entire puzzle"" only filled in one word (for the 1-down clue) when I started from the ""hints for 1-down"" screen.  In contrast  ""reveal entire puzzle"" filled in the entire puzzle when I started from a ""press-and-hold-on-clue"" popup.  Worse  the general settings for navigation (e.g.  ""skip filled squares""  ""show mistakes"") don't seem to function at all.  (Perhaps this is another Kindle Fire HD issue for the developer to fix.)  The app allows you to enter multiple letters in a single square  and to look up puzzle info (must-haves for NY Times crossword solvers).  If you are a NY Times crosswords subscriber  the app will automatically download the daily puzzles for you.  The app comes with an assortment of puzzles already installed  and allows you to browse for and download many more puzzles from the Internet.  It also allows you to establish an account and compare your times with other solvers.  However  the FREE [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] app does nearly all of the same things.  (Crosswords Plus does not download your NY Times subscription puzzles automatically  although it makes it easy to download them daily it doesn't come with puzzles loaded  although it points you to free Internet sources and it doesn't have a feature for comparing scores with other solvers.)  In addition  [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] allows you to resize the grid  offers an alternate clues-only view  includes the usual hints options  and has navigational settings (skipping boxes  etc.) that are fully functional on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet.  Even if this CROSSWORDS app worked perfectly  I would still prefer [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]].  For this reason  and because of the high price and current Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet issues  I rate CROSSWORDS at 3 stars.",0
stocking stuffers,It IS Perfect!!. I'm 62 and love this primer. That's why I'm here searching for more. If the price is right I may pick up a couple more for stocking stuffers.,1
fun for them to take,Great gummies to help build tiny immune systems!. I saw these during the current pandemic and thought they would be great for my two gransons to take to help build up their immune systems. I wasn't sure how they would like them and I was pleasantly surprised that they actually liked them! I have been giving these to them daily for two weeks now and have just ordered another bottle. I find it funny that they actually remind me when they need to take them  lol. I think anything that's good for them and also fun for them to take is a win-win. I highly recommend.,1
shelf for cup dispenser and sonic toothbrush,plug extender with shelf. This is really great.  I use the shelf for my cup dispenser and my sonic toothbrush.  I have WAY more plug in options than I need... a bunch of plug ins INCLUDING USB ports!  Further  there is a night light.  It points directly at my toilet cubby so it's about perfect.  It plugged right into the wall plug and is VERY stable even without the screw (I put into a GFI  so I couldn't use the center screw).  The only negative I have to report is that the plugins are all toward the front.  I wish there was a side plug in so that the plug head of my toothbrush didn't stick straight out... Eh.  That's a small complaint  I couldn't ding a star for that cause it's kinda a personal thing.  The shelf has little grooves that was SUPER easy to slide the shelf right on.  The unit is bright white (works perfectly in my white bathroom).  To be honest  I didn't think I was gonna love this as much as I do.  Having said all that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
dangerous item for someone with kids,Not What I Expected. I ordered this thinking it had a cigarette light charger so I could use it in my car. Nope - it has a standard USB charger. It has a cigarette LIGHTER so you can light your cigarette. Well  I have no need for a cigarette lighter  plus I think that could be a dangerous item for someone with kids. It does have a variety of charging types which is helpful and those work well. I don't have any apple products  so I couldn't test that out  but the others worked fine. I think the description needs to be improved so others don't make the same mistake that I do.,0
fog only lasts for short bursts,Ahhh. This is a decent fog machine however the fog only lasts for short bursts. I got it for our Halloween setup but the fog looks unintentional (if that makes sense). It would produce the fog  then the fog completely dissipates  then more fog.  If you used this as a set prop in a 12x12 room  it would likely work well. I did try a few different fog liquids and still no success. We ended up borrowing our neighbors and it worked well. Their machine looked similar to ours so I don’t know what occurred.  I think it works ok  just needs to be a very small area.,0
start over,Super cool sharks. I my daughter likes the sharks one time she accidentally deleted it and had to start over if u like sharks please get this game,0
not quick,Does work to charge S7  but definitely not quick .... Does work to charge S7  but definitely not quick charge. Questioning whether or not it's genuine OEM -- however it is inexpensive and works.,0
"""danceable feast for the ears and refreshingly original""","Interesting twists on dance/electronic. I first heard of Parisian DJ David Guetta (a fixture in Ibiza and Paris) on the ""Pioneer: The Album Vol. 3"" while living in Spain (Ibiza CDs are EVERYWHERE) with his fabulous single ""Love Don't Let Me Go."" After a long wait  ""Just A Little More Love"" is being released in North America---it's ABOUT TIME!!!. His album is a pleasing blend of styles and moods  all of it intensely danceable. The main highlight for me was not only Guetta's fantastic mixing  but the soulful  searing vocals by gospel phenom Chris Willis (backing vocalist for Amy Grant  CeCe Winans  Twilla Paris  Garth Brooks  and Dolly Parton among others) that made the album come alive. ""Just A Little More Love"" sounds like a throwback to the heyday of the `80s  with elements of funk and disco scattered throughout the driving beats. The album spawned a number of singles  including Ibiza megahit ""Love Don't Let Me Go."" This North American release features an altered tracklist from the European debut  adding the Just For One Day (Heroes) remix from Guetta's new album F*** Me I'm Famous (named after an Ibiza tradition)  cuts several others (Chris Willis' You  Atomic Food)  and substitutes edits for several (Just a Little More Love Elektro edit  Distortion vocal edit  Just a Little More Love Wally Lopez remix edit). The majority of the thirteen songs are vocal-driven  with the exception of 133 and Lately  both instrumentals. Themes range from the noble: social reform (Can't U Feel The Change)  self-empowerment (It's Alright)  love and desire (the campy Sexy 17  People Come  People Go  Give Me Something  the riveting Love Don't Let Me Go  You Are The Music) and just plain fun (Distortion). This North American release is much more geared for club play with the addition of Just For One Day and the edits/remixes. A danceable feast for the ears and refreshingly original. Remember to check out Guetta's new album F*** Me I'm Famous as well.",1
action plan book,Type 2 Diabetic cookbook and action plan book. My sister was recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. So I purchased this book for her.  She really appreciated the information along with interesting and inspiring recipes.  She took an education class - recommended by her doctor - and most of what was taught in the class followed the suggestions in this book.  I think it's a great &#34starting&#34 book for someone who is new to diabetes based on my sister's input.,1
happy story,Rio. As I was busy floating over the movies we owned I suddenly realized we owned Rio2 but not Rio!  Yikes!  It's a really beautiful story of birds in the Amazon - singable music and a happy story.  Worth the purchase all day long.,1
sturdy,Works Great!. Got for our bathroom remodel for a more rustic look. My husband attached to a new vanity it’s sturdy works great,1
feel is okay,A Lot of Mouse. I have never used a gaming mouse before. Actually I've looked down on people who did for the same reason I don't like some players being on steroids in major league sports. But now that I'm getting older  my reactions are slower  my fingers are not as quick on the keys and...Oh...I guess I like it for exactly the same reasons athletes love steroids...  But on a serious note.  Mousing and key gnashing do take a toll. I don't know that this mouse is a complete solution to it. But I have had relief of being able to have some things macroed to a single mouse button.  If nothing else  it has created a different movement.  I like the quality of the mouse.  The tracking is very good  the feel is okay  the looks are richly industrial.  I'm not huge on the extending base to the mouse.  I just wish it had been a little bigger to fit my hand  but it fits fine without extending. Personally  a little heavier would feel a little better as well.  All in all I'm very impressed  and wished I had given into &#34juicing&#34 my game a long time ago.,1
don't leave a residue after wiping,Great for kids with eczema!. I have two kids with eczema on their hands and they cannot use regular alcohol wipes.  These wipes were perfect and did not sting their skin and it wipes clean!  They don't leave a residue after wiping either which is a plus!,1
doesn't have a lot of fragrance and doesn't last long.,Smells Awful  Not Worth the Money. The only reason this even gets two stars is that the Pumpkin Spice Latte actually smells pretty good. Other than that  this set is horrible. The pumpkin cupcake scent isn't good. It doesn't smell anything even close to a cupcake or pumpkin spice. It's more of the artificial cinnamon smell and even that's not good. Also  I don't get why it's a light pink when it's supposed to be pumpkin cupcake but that's not even the issue. This scent was awful and gave me a huge headache. Do not like it at all. I do really like the Pumpkin Latte though as it has a very nice pumpkin spice smell with a hint of vanilla that levels it out. It isn't highly scented but my warmer is in a small room and the smell is nice and I can smell it nicely in that room. I can't however smell it anywhere else throughout the house  which is a shame. I use many different waxes from all types of companies and usually  I can smell the scent  even faintly  throughout the house  not with this one though. I still really like the scent though  and it wouldn't hurt for it to be tripled scented than what it is now. The pumpkin spice scent is okay. It isn't horrible but it isn't that great either. It doesn't have a lot of fragrance and doesn't last but only a few hours if that. Overall these were some of the worst wax cubes that I have bought and I DO NOT recommend these at all. If they changed the scents and added more scents to these  then maybe that would make these better but as they are right now  I will NEVER buy these again. I would much rather spend the money and get Scenty wax melts.,0
attractive,Perfect size. These pots are attractive  durable  and a great value.  They are perfect for succulents  and their 4 inch size allows room to drop in a 3 inch planting pot.  I love the wooden saucer  and will be looking for it whenever I shop for planters again.,1
wheels are slightly below the platform and roll,This cart will absolutely exceed your expectations!. This cart exceeded my expectations by 200% even at the $169 price tag.  It is designed to work hard and not break.  It’s built like a tank  I have no doubt about the 400 lb load rating. The larger wheels easily go up/down stairs and curbs.  I expect this cart to last a very long time.  One cool feature is that when the cart is closed and the wheels are folded up  if you hold it vertically  the wheels are slightly below the platform and roll.  This comes in handy if you don’t have any cargo and you’re have limited access  you can close the cart and roll it instead of carrying it.  You won’t be disappointed with this cart!,1
hour-glass one is easy to hold in the center,Love the colors in this sponge set sponge texture is light metal holder is great. This is a lovely set of three sponges in nice colors of  pink  burgundy  and teal. It also comes with a great metal sponge holder  a silicone brush cleaner  and some cleaning solution. The sponges are light and airy like most sponges like this on the market.   The burgundy sponge with the flat side is great for smooth applications. The typical egg-shaped (teal) and the hour-glass (pink) sponges are good for blending or any large make-up application. The hour-glass one is easy to hold in the center.  These feel good in the hands  blend reasonably well  and feel soft against my skin. These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.  I personally do not use a silicone sponge cleaner. I prefer to use my hands and soap and water but having the silicone cleaner with cleaning solution provided is a nice touch.  The sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges as well as whether it is for gifting or not. The colors are important too--at least to me.   The current price of $7.99 is a great deal for this.,1
does what I need it to do,Ok. Works well. Works ok does what I need it to do,1
stinks so bad,STINKS!!!!. OK so this product is amazing at catching flies however it stinks so bad! My whole backyard smells like a rotting fish market within like four days. We moved it to an even for their location away from the area where everyone hangs out in and it still stunk so bad. We had to throw it away. I would so totally buy this if you were not anywhere near it but if you plan to be socializing within 300 yards or so from it prepare for stink,0
series,Very Good. Excellent soundtrack for excellent series.,1
works on our PS4,Nice Rugged Cable that Can Fulfill a Lot More Roles. This is a nice  ruggedly made micro USB cable. So it can be so much more than just a PS4 cable.  In fact I have found that our PS4 is more sensitive to bad cables than any other device we have  so since it works on our PS4  we can expect it to work for all our micro USB devices.  At $9 you can get a cheaper cable  but again  we have had issues with cheaper cables in the past on the PS4. It is not an outrageous price by any means but you could save a little.  What you do get for the added cost is a nice thick cable with strong ends that I don't foresee unravelling any time soon.  We love the color which also helps identify it as our PS4 cable.  We are very happy with it and are glad to be able to charge another controller at the same time.,1
hold boxes of 100 gloves,glove box holder/dispenser. I purchased 2 of these... one for the kitchen and one for the bathroom.  Very simple  coated wire.  No more digging for where I last put the box of gloves.  Tidy and organized.  I like them.  They do come with lightweight mollys and screws - the frame is really light too.  I am hopeful the mollys will help when you add the box of gloves - I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. UPDATE:  This item will hold boxes of 100 gloves - nothing than that.,1
deep way of getting to people,"Disappointing Debut Album. What were they thinking to put out an album like this from the man who wants to sing opera?  This is an odd assortment of songs with only Nessun Dorma from opera.  And what's with singing pop songs in Italian?  Did they not have enough opera songs that Paul was good at so that they had to take other songs that he knew and make them sound like opera?  Then to include the hymns (O Holy Night and Silent Night)  which Paul does okay with  but have been done far better by many singers.  The worst stinker on the album is the Spanish version of My Way.  Also Paul has an interesting way of pronouncing MUSIC.  He sings ""Moo-Sick""  rather that ""Mew-Sick"" as most of us say it in the song Music of the Night.  Paul has a way of going deep into the soul (or something like that) and bringing people to tears with his songs. (Yes  me too.)  He is not the best singer  but with that way of getting to people in a very deep way  he will succeed.  Give the man 10 stars  but this recording doesn't rate much more than 3 or 4.  It's a shame and I truly hope this is not the ""one chance"" for Paul Potts to shine.  I honestly believe he will shine if they do a good job on future albums.",1
Can't wait to give it to him,FAST Shipping!. Ordered this book for my father in law for Christmas & the shipping was FAST. Item arrived as expected. Can't wait to give it to him.,1
grotesque,Cheap cheap cheap cheap material. This does not look as full and vibrant as the picture! This is poorly constructed and entirely not flattering to anybody type! The material is so thin that you can see right through it and the feel of it just makes you break out in a rash just by looking at it before you even put it on. This is grotesque and if you cannot pronounce the name of the company you should not buy!,0
paper quality,300 sheet drawing pad. My 7 year old is a budding artist - for real - this pad is a godsend.  He can draw and draw and follow his inspirations each day - leaving each piece in place to review later with the spiral binding.  I love these pads.  You get 3 pads.  That will keep him busy for a few months. The paper is good paper quality  artist quality.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new inf seem useful.,1
generous size,Adds the little extra to your soaking bath time. Who doesn’t like bath bombs? Well clearly if you are on here you do and you are in the right place if you ask me. These bath bombs are great. They are a very nice generous size which means they last a nice long time giving you a nice longer experience while you enjoy your nice soaking bath. The fragrances these have are fantastic. I tend to be very picky when it comes to fragrances and love that this one has a huge variety  from citrus to flowers to “plain” vanilla.  You get a total of 12 of these bath bombs for just over $20 which is a good deal in my eyes and well worth it. These come in a very nice box that also lends perfectly to gift these for the holidays but also for birthdays but really any occasion if you ask me. I will probably have to get these again when I am out. The only one I am not a fan of is eucalyptus mint  but that is because I just don’t like that fragrance but it will come in handy when I have a cold or flu to clean up those sinuses.,1
not what I was expecting,Not what I was expecting. It was okay for a one time purchase. Thanks,0
The seller is quick and it came in great shape,Fantastic. This game is amazing for two people. Great for a couple in my scenario. Instructions not in English  but they are easy to find. The seller is quick and it came in great shape.,1
product came in good shape,Finally got it. I've been wanting this song in 'hard copy' for awhile so when I saw this CD/DVD combo (and it was my birthday)  I snapped it up. The seller was great. The product came in good shape and in good time all the way from Japan so I'm really happy. I was a little worried about region but I was able to play it with the Power DVD with no issues. The song is one of my favorites from Exile the Second as is the music video so it is nice to have the hard copy for my library.,1
works well,Didn’t stick at all. Cool concept and works well but if it doesn’t stick then what’s the use,1
fits her perfectly,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
extremely pricey,Nice supplement but on the pricey side. On the plus side  I rarely eat breakfast in the morning and I easily can take one of these with no adverse stomach or heartburn side effects. In reading the ingredients  these appear to be chock full of almost everything my 60 year old body needs to be healthy and feel energetic. I have been taking them now for two weeks and I honestly do not feel different  but I am sure it is too soon to tell. On the negative side (hence the deduction of one star)  this is almost $50 for a little over 3 week supply. I find this extremely pricey and not something that I will continue taking once I have completed the bottle (unless I have a miraculous awakening that I do not feel currently). Thinking that Centrum Silver or One a Day for Women can fill most of this for a far more reasonable price.,0
same product three months in a row,Disappointed. I have been getting the snack boxes for about a year now. When they first started they had a nice variety of healthy options that were different from usual snack fare. The last four boxes however have been a huge disappointment. I have even gotten the same product three months in a row. And the snacks seem to have degraded from actual healthy options to “health halo” options such as natural potato chips. After having been extremely disappointed for the third month in a row now  I am cancelling my subscription. I wouldn’t even recommend this unless you like getting the same things over and over.,0
sturdy,Not bad - ok for price. Ok value for money  seem to be sturdy and they look ok,1
extremely helpful tool,Super oily and extremely sharp be careful.. At first I really didn't like how oily they were stacked together. I literally sliced my thumb open on the first one I was trying to take off the pile. I sliced my thumb again as I was trying to wipe the oily residue off before loading the rotary cutter. So use and clean with a lot of care. I was on a time crunch to complete a project and didn't have the time for the accidents my first attempt caused me. 😂  However  as long as you are careful and use cautious care they were a great buy for a little price. I will purchase these again when I finish using all that came in the pack.  I did ask a quilter friend that regularly uses her cuter and wheels why they needed to be so gross with oil. I was told that it has to do with how many come in the stack and to keep them very sharp while being tossed about during the moving  handling  and shipping. I don't know if her answer is the reason or not but it did make sense to me.  Just handle with extreme care always. Do not let young children use a rotary cutter. And don't let teens that can barely cut with scissors use either. (I'm not being funny with the teen part they will hurt themselves.) Take my word for it. I had teens helping with the project. Only responsible people should use these extremely helpful tool! This was the best tool (along with the self healing mat) I was ever gifted!,1
no grill to clean or grilling on a surface that might not be cleaned well,"Convenient. These disposable grills are awesome for a quick  easy bbq.  They are perfect for ""precooked"" like hotdogs/brats.  If you want to grill something raw  chicken/beef  I find a piece of foil over the top of cooking food is helpful to focus the heat.  I love that the ""charcoal"" is all natural and no lighter fluid is necessary. I use the smaller size when it's just me. The larger size cooked 8 hotdogs and 4 brats easily (space).  I also like the sanitary aspect of using these... no grill to clean or grilling on a surface that might not be cleaned well. NOTE:  Beware of using the wire brushes on your grill - the metal brissles can be ingested and puncture your intestines - which is life threatening not to mention painful!  When using a regular grill  once the grates have cooled you can soak the grill grates in garbage sack with a little detergent. Next day  hose them off. Yeah  it's a little more of a hassle  but NO metal brissles to ingest. All in all  these disposable grills are really meant for ""lightweight"" grilling projects. I just like the additional positive aspects of using them  like the cleanliness aspect. Hope this info helps!",1
microphone speaker,Great microphone speaker. My son loves to sing so I bought him this for xmas. It was easy to pair up with my iPhone 6s. I was able to play music from my music library or the amazon music app. Great sound. I wasn't sure how to lower the sound though from the microphone. I had to do it from my phone. And I wish there was an option to do a light show instead of just picking one LED color. Love being able to charge using USB instead of batteries. I definitely recommend this bluetooth karaoke microphone.,1
Muslim couple,"A lovely tale of matchmaking  true love and modern India. Hyder Ali  a retired clerk  is driving his patient wife crazy with his post-retirement boredom. They are a Muslim couple living in Visakhapatnam (Vizag)  a coastal city in Andhra Pradesh in eastern India. His only son  Rehman  is a political activist dedicated to helping India's exploited  which gets him into trouble with the police (and his father). Mr. Ali decides to start a marriage bureau to earn extra income  and in doing so  finds unexpected happiness and reconciliation.  Mr. Ali  aided by his shrewd wife  quickly gains numerous clients seeking arranged marriages. Farahad Zama does a great job of easing Western readers into India's complicated caste system  along with its many restrictions  without departing from the story and events at hand. Some of the families insist on the unobtainable (the perfect wife: beautiful  pale complexion  English-speaking  rich  matching caste  or a software engineer husband in California)  but Mr. Ali is able to match several successfully.  The two main foci are the situation with Mr. Ali's son Rehman  who is arrested for participating in a political protest  and the unfortunate situation of Mr. Ali's young secretary Aruna  who was forced to drop out of graduate school due to her father's prolonged illness and their precarious economic situation. The narratives weave together seamlessly  along with the fruits of Mr. and Mrs. Ali's matchmaking prowess.  Indian culture is the real star here: the contrast between ancient traditions and modernity. We're given a taste of how Vizag's Christians  Muslims  and Hindus live side by side  of the intricacies of Muslim and Hindu weddings  and the sprawling Indian bureaucracy. There are numerous culinary delights  from rooh afza to idli  coconut chutney  and prasaadam. The author thoughtfully includes several cultural primers masquerading as Mrs. Ali's English ""essays"" that give the reader a background into Vizag  the caste system and Urdu and Telugu words for extended family. It reminded me of the recent excellent Vine selection [[ASIN:1416583688 The Case of the Missing Servant: A Vish Puri Mystery]]  another novel set in India that also dealt with Indian arranged marriages and Indian culture and customs.  A delightful  sparkling read that is full of moments of humor and unexpected tenderness  ""The Marriage Bureau for Rich People"" showcases both the good and bad of modern India: corruption and poverty tempered by quiet generosity and strong communities. Romantic and light without being cloying  this is a perfect summer read that fans of Indian culture will be sure to enjoy.",1

nice quality build,Awesome little jeep. Awesome little jeep.  It is a nice quality build.  Pretty easy to put together.  Fits a toddler great!  Easy to maneuver  except for those short turns  haha!  It holds up to 50 lbs so it can last a smaller child for years.  I could have ridden in this until I was in 6th grade  but I was a tiny child. Lots of fun and brings lots of excitement to see their very own brightly colored  pink jeep!  Be sure you have it fully charged before giving it to the child  because they will want to ride it all day!,1
enjoy this magazine over others,I really enjoy this magazine over others. I get tons of women's magazines.  Most of them I don't need or just flip through them.

country oriented,little bit of rock  a little bit of country and a little bit of rap. it is funny  how within one song you can get a real mix of composition!  for a new comer  she has a great voice and like a review before  she definately has a bit of carrie underwood  a bit of pussycat  and a little bit of Wyonna too.  The lyrics are definately more country orientated.  Strong voice  great music beat and many of the songs  I couldnt help tapping my feet and I am going to incorporate many of songs in my personal spinning exercise program.  Definately a good album to play in an open car!,1
headaches,Contains a poisonous toxic chemical formaldehyde. I am highly allergic to formaldehyde   it cause me to be dizzy. Have headaches   watering eyes. Sore throat.

I read the remarks  and another person asked Amazon if there was formaldehyde in it  and they referred this person to the manufacturer. Located in Hong Kong   they gave the person the run around on the answer. And never did admit it. It is illegal to put it into anything here in the US. I was exposed to it through 2 different sets of sheets and one face cream. And now this hair conditioner. Ive contacted the manufacturer   but I doubt I'll hear from them!!,0

buttons are nice and large,"Decent controller  but the six-button may be more suitable.. For most of the earlier games on the Genesis  this controller works fine. The buttons are nice and large  and three is all you need for many of the platformers. For a majority of the other games  the six-button controller is a bit more useful  but also has a better shape (in my opinion). I find the three-button controller to be a bit goofy in the hands  and I can never find the ""perfect"" position to hold it in between my palms. The six-button one slides into my hands like most other controllers. Still  it's a great controller to own in any retro-game enthusiast's collection.",1
conscious eating,Simple recipes for a long life  the Shoku-Iku way!. Much like the traditional Japanese Buddhist shojin ryori  Shoku Iku (“food education”) is a Japanese concept involving conscious eating: what we eat  how we prepare it  and how different foods are combined. Much like the traditional Japanese Buddhist shojin ryori  shoku iku is based on the power of five: each meal should have five colors (green/blue  red/orange  white  black/brown  yellow)  tastes (sweet  sour  bitter  salt  umami)  senses  food groups and cooking methods (steam  simmer  broil  grill and fry  no-cook  sushi).  Makiko Sano’s new book “Healthy Japanese Cooking” (published in the UK as “Shoku Iku”) immediately caught my eye having lived in Japan on multiple occasions  I have long been attracted to Japanese washoku (traditional cuisine) and shojin ryori (Buddhist vegan cuisine). Traditional Japanese meals are based on the freshest seasonal ingredients  engage all the senses  and if eaten properly and with mindfulness  should leave you satisfied but not stuffed (the Japanese concept of hara hachi bu  or eat until you are 80 percent full).  Beginning with the essential dashi (stock) and dressings (rosemary soy  sweet soy  sesame salad sprinkle  shabu shabu and others)  there are very handy illustrations and step-by-step photos to instruct you on rolling sushi  julienning vegetables  etc. Dashi is the backbone of most Japanese soups / hot pots  and you'll find several variations here  including basic dashi (kelp + bonito flakes)  vegetarian dashi (kelp and dried shiitake)  Motoko's dashi (made with liquid from cooking brown rice I had not seen this method in my other cookbooks!)  and two soup stocks.  I found the chapter on steaming particularly helpful as I have not cooked fish via this method before  but you’ll find heavenly steamed sea bream  a posh cod dinner in 20 minutes  steamed chicken  stuffed veggies  pork dumplings  etc.  most cooked in the microwave. However  a word of caution these recipes were tested at 800 watts  and it would appear that American microwaves are more powerful in general (mine is 1.58 kW)  so you may need to adjust cooking times.  Some of the steamed dishes are cooked on the stovetop my new favorite discovery is the “Full Japanese” garden breakfast  full of leafy greens  tomatoes  mushrooms and eggs nestled into the greens. I also loved the vegan monk recipe for stuffed pumpkin and steamed sticky rice  which is full of carrots  shiitake  and mushrooms (you can leave out the chicken to make it vegan). And my favorite steamed custard chawanmushi also makes an appearance  as do perfect teatime snacks mochi  sweet potato treats  and fruit buns.  The fried chapter includes Japanese burgers and shrimp barbecue  but you’ll also find healthy low-fat vegetarian options like Japanese grilled vegetable “stir fry” (half grilled  half steamed)  eggplant and shallot salad  “full of goodness” (with a liberal helping of my favorite Japanese vegetable  lotus root!)  and chili tofu. The sushi chapter features an amazing brown shiitake and pumpkin sushi  temaki  sesame seed salmon sushi  brown rice tuna sushi with sweet-hot sauce  five senses super-tasty salmon sushi  and some new variations like wasabi cream cheese sushi with lamb  avocado and pear quinoa power sushi  and sushi canapes.  Ingredients are listed both in metric and US (volume). Beautiful full-color photos by Lisa Linder capture the aesthetic of Japanese cuisine  with beautiful tableware that offsets the featured dish perfectly.  The resulting dishes  all of which embrace the “shoku iku” philosophy  are light  nutritious  and provide plenty of variety of colors  flavors  and textures that are sure to brighten any meal. I found several new dishes that I plan on making frequently  including the egg and tofu dashi soup  rice noodles with mushroom broth  pan tai  iced tomatoes  brown shiitake and pumpkin sushi  and steamed sticky rice.  If you are new to Japanese cooking / flavors  then “Healthy Japanese Cooking” is the perfect introduction as it uses commonplace ingredients (you may have to order some of the more traditional ingredients like kombu and bonito flakes online)  simple techniques  and is aligned much more closely with the traditional Japanese diet based on fish and vegetables than many Japanese cookbooks aimed at Western audiences.  (Thank you to Makiko Sano for the review copy!),1

characters are throwaway,A quick read  but a disjointed and lightweight plot. Dead and Gone  the ninth installment in Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire series  is both a curse and a blessing. Let's start with the good news first: the blessing is that it's a quick  breezy read (I finished it in a couple of hours). The curse is that the plot is lightweight  many of the characters are throwaway  and the book reaches a new level of graphic violence on par with HBO's [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]] adaptation.  As I've noted in the most recent Southern Vampire novels  Sookie is starting to show her age. She's currently without a love life she's sworn off Bill after discovering his treachery  she broke off her relationship with weretiger Quinn  and Eric seems to want to claim her for her own (finally  we get some more Eric action!).  In Dead and Gone  Sookie is once again called upon to discover the perpetrator of a gruesome crime when one of her shifter acquaintances is found brutally murdered behind Merlotte's. Like the vampires before them  the Weres have also decided to go mainstream  and this may be the reason behind the death. There's also a secondary plot involving Sookie's fairy connections through her great-grandfather Niall  and of a brewing war between rival fairy factions that threatens Sookie and everyone that she loves.  The main problem with Dead and Gone is that little time is given to what is supposed to be a central theme. Sure  Sookie's fairy heritage has been revealed in bits and pieces over several books  but in Dead and Gone  this plays a central role yet little is revealed about Harris's fairy culture other than the fact that Sookie is constantly in danger. Regarding the level of violence  the bodies pile up with little rhyme or reason characters that have been present in several books are handily dispatched for no apparent reason other than to generate  collateral damage. Several pregnant women are murdered. There are also graphic depictions of crucifixion and torture that may be disturbing to some readers.  The narrative is disjointed and contains numerous errors regarding events in earlier books. The biggest flaw is the lack of interest too much time is spent on the initial murder while the real battle is anticlimactic. The numerous red herrings (Octavia discovering a long-lost flame and moving out  former friend Arlene's betrayal that nearly results in Sookie's demise  Quinn's single appearance  Sookie mentioning her nephew Hunter only twice) only serve to fill pages and do nothing to advance the backstory or the action. Dead and Gone isn't a total loss  but it's not an engrossing read either  more of a beach book that's good for summer afternoons. Yes  it reads quickly  but I felt like precious little had actually occurred in 300 pages. I can only hope that the next installment sees a deeper story and more character development.,0
in-jokes regarding Canadian law,"Another fine example of Canadian humor...that you'll never see in the US. I first read about Bon Cop  Bad Cop while riding the train to Montreal. There was a bilingual featurette on the film in VIA Rail's magazine  and I was instantly intrigued. I'd seen Colm Feore at Stratford four years ago  and I was familiar with Patrick Huard from the Les Boys hockey film franchise. I studied at Laval University in Quebec City for two months  and specialized in Quebec Studies (history  literature  and cinema) as an undergraduate  so I was intrigued to see how the film would balance both the bilingual and bicultural aspects of living in Canada. The issue of Quebec is a contentious one for a number of political  social  and cultural reasons. Bon Cop  Bad Cop attempts to use humor in an attempt to defuse volatile issues between the Two Solitudes (English- and French-speaking Canada).  A series of brutal murders in the Canadian hockey community pairs together two very different cops: Torontonian Martin Ward  (Colm Feore) a by-the-book  prim-and-proper intellectual  and rough-and-tumble David Bouchard  a shoot first  ask later detective from Montreal. Naturally  the two despise each other at first sight  and the rapid-fire bilingual one-liners between Martin and David are fast and furious from the get-go. Some critics panned the film for a seemingly forced  unnatural balance of bilingual script  but as someone who's trilingual  I frequently switch languages when speaking to other bilingual friends nothing unnatural there.  Much of the comedic humor comes from the culture clash between Martin and David  Ontario and Quebec there are numerous in-jokes regarding Canadian law  stereotypes of Quebeckers (diehard smokers  dangerous drivers  womanizers) and Torontonians (cold  boring  workaholics) and nods to popular Canadian culture (Rick Mercer of This Hour has 22 Minutes does a great Don Cherry impression  Uniprix commercial spoof  cameo by Nanette Workman). There are some hilarious scenes involving tortured translation between the Quebec police chief and his Ontarian counterpart as the two (fully bilingual) detectives watch in disbelief. The secondary characters really shine  from a speed-talking coroner to Martin's glamorous  hip sister who's hot for David  as does the bilingual script. The special effects are very well done considering that the film had an $8 million budget.  In the vein of earlier Canadian comedies like [[ASIN:B00006FDCT Strange Brew]]and [[ASIN:B00006IUG0 Men With Brooms]](a curling ""comedy"" from Paul Gross aka Constable Benton Frasier of [[ASIN:B000A0GY0K Due South: Season One (4-DVD Digipack)]])  Bon Cop  Bad Cop is a sendup of that great Canadian pastime  hockey. Of course  beer  curling  beavers  and the fleur de lis make prerequisite appearances  as does marijuana (there is a priceless scene involving a self-destructing marijuana greenhouse that brought to mind the British comedy [[ASIN:B00003CXMY Saving Grace]]). Romantic interest? Check. (You'll never think of ""Vive le Quebec libre!"" quite the same way again...) Action? Car chases? Explosions? Check. The weakest part of the film is the villain  who is never really developed we never know  or care  why he turned psychotic. There is also a gratuitous amount of violence and swearing (nearly all in French) that seemed over-the-top  but it's obvious from the start that this is a film that has no intentions of taking itself seriously.  Looking at these elements separately  Bon Cop  Bad Cop would appear to be another shallow attempt at creating a uniquely ""Canadian"" comedy. But there is an unexpected depth and tenderness in the character development between Martin  David and their respective families (both men are divorced single parents)  and the bilingual dialogue really shines. Huard and Feore give standout performances  and I felt right at home in that strange limbo between Quebec and Ontario from my experiences in both English- and French-speaking Canada. This is a gem that deserves to be seen!",1
bright white beard,santa hair and beard. The picture shows such a lovely bright white beard and hair piece... however.. the one I received is really gray.  NOT bright white at all. Disappointed.  It comes netted  so I removed a bit of the netting to see it was just the netting that was gray... sadly not.  The netting does keep the faux hairs neat until you want to use them.  However  I am going to be looking for a more true white set. UPDATE:  11/22... Ok... The wig is a mess.  We discarded it.  And again... the beard is GRAY.... NOT WHITE.  However  I will report that it is very full.,0
recommend paying the few bucks extra for that ability,fire lane signs. Purchased 10 of these for our street after Fire chief declared.  They are a good quality.  I accidentally bought the kind that is NOT graffiti washable.  I do recommend paying the few bucks extra for that ability - otherwise you must replace the whole sign.,1
designs,Festive Masks!. For the first year of the pandemic  I primarily wore reusable cloth masks. This fall I started wearing disposable ones. I like to coordinate my masks to my outfits or the seasons. I'm very happy with these Christmas masks. They're individually wrapped. The masks feel a little thicker than some of the other disposable ones I've used. They're soft  too. I like the designs a lot. They have the metal nosebridge piece. The elastic ear straps are secured between layers of the mask rather than attached on the side. They seem very secure. They're also comfortable. I will be wearing these as soon as Thanksgiving is over!,1

writers,"Wine Reviews  News  and More. Wine Spectator is a good wine magazine that seeks to keep the reader informed about new wine products  wine facts and education  and wine events. This magazine is published 17 times per year  so it is available often enough that most wine lovers will have more than their fill of reading material.  Most of the material in Wine Spectator deals with buying wine  and you can expect to find several rating lists in every issue. The editors of the magazine supply the majority of the wine ratings  so when you read that one wine earned 95 points and another only 80  you need to keep in mind that these ratings are from the perspective of people who have sampled hundreds or even thousands of different wines. And with each rating or analysis  there is often contact information  such as the name of the winery or web page  so that you can learn more and/or inquire on making a purchase.  To help shoppers find the wines in each issue  Wine Spectator includes a detachable card that includes the names of the different featured wines. This is a handy addition  because it eliminates the need to copy down names of wine on paper or attempt to memorize the titles. All you do is check off the wines you like on the card and take it with you to your favorite beverage store for easy reference.  Wine Spectator seems to have an obsession with lists and with outlandish proclamations. It is common to find lists like ""World's 100 Greatest Pinot"" or ""The 50 Finest California Reds"". Consumers are attracted to listings  and that is probably why the magazine gave in and made lists a regular part of most issues. And it is common to find extreme statements like ""This is the best Cabernet Sauvignon on the Planet"" or ""Greatest German White Wine Ever"". The publication does this to attract attention and sell more issues  but it could get annoying to some readers.  In spite of these few annoyances  Wine Spectator is still a good magazine. The writers at Wine Spectator are very good  very convincing  and very persuasive. They really know wine  and it comes through in their articles and recommendations. The editors articulate themselves very well and they know just the right way to describe the different brands and styles. It all adds up to a very informative magazine publication on the world of wine.",1
fits well without interfering with the operation of the phone,Great OtterBox Phone Case!. This case lives up to the OtterBox name. It fits well without interfering with the operation of the phone. The two tone colors is attractive. The phone case is comfortable to hold and easy to grip. It's not bulky  but still offers adequate protection. The only criticism that I have is that I find the little flap that covers the charging port to be annoying.,1
bit pricy,works  but drains the battery. I purchased this for use with Kindle Fire while I am in Canada and can't access my streaming any other way... The up side is that it works really well  a bit pricy  but I use it.  The downside is that is sucks the battery down quite steadily and quickly.  I tend to use it when I can keep my Kindle plugged in. If they could work on the battery drain  it would be a five star.,0
clean up beautifully,Can't buy a better set of cookware anywhere!. Let me begin by saying I love Circulon cookware. My kitchen is a walking advertisement for it. It is designed for the cook  from the detailed handles that fit correctly in the palm of your hand to the way the pots clean up beautifully. I have never had a problem with the non-stick cookware peeling or pitting or scratching in anyway (unlike the Calphalon I have had in the past). Now specific to this set: This is the perfect housewarming or shower present for the bride to be. This set will last for years and will make even the most novice chef appear to be a professional on the first try out. There is every size in the set (perhaps with the exception of a really large stock pot) which a chef could ever need. Last weekend  I actually used almost the whole set simultaneously cooking an Italian dinner for my extended family  and I can assure you the set was well used  scraped and stirred for several courses. After the set was washed   it looked like I just took it out of the box. Circulon may be a little more pricey than some lower cost manufacturers. But it's the old adage  you get what you pay for. Circulon is simply the best!,1
excellent bridal shower or housewarming present,Great stockpot  perfect for everyone!. This is a great stockpot for the money. First  it is super attractive  well made and lightweight. I love this color  too  it blends with all my kitchen decor. I love Rachel Ray products as they always provide good products at reasonable prices. This 6 quart size is great for making pasta and soups. This would make an excellent bridal shower or housewarming present for anyone. Highly recommend!,1
meat dishes,A gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!. When I think of Malaysian dishes  it’s the spicy  layered flavors of Norman Musa’s “Amazing Malaysian” that I think of. It opens with street food and snacks  and moves on to seafood  meat  vegetables  rice and noodles  pudding and drinks  and the Malaysian pantry. Gorgeous photos of street scenes in Malaysia pepper the pages  while the gold-embossed cover looks great sitting out on a table or countertop.  You'll find street snack favorites like chicken satay  net pancakes  roti canai  and fried spring rolls  along with Indian lentil patties  grilled fish paste in banana leaf  tofu stuffed with crunchy vegetables  and the gorgeous Kak Besah’s curry puffs. The seafood dishes reminded me of many preparations I had last year while working in Taiwan whole fish steamed with lemongrass  ginger and chilies  squid stir fry  and scrambled eggs with oysters. The meat dishes featured are mostly chicken and beef (no pork unlike Ping’s book)  with lamb curry  beef rendang  and numerous chicken dishes.  One of my new favorite recipes is the Nyonya Vermicelli Noodle Salad  which features rice noodles  tofu beansprouts  and ginger with plenty of lime juice and fresh herbs (if you are vegetarian  leave out the shrimp paste and prawns). I also loved the Malay Vegetable Dhal Curry  pumpkin in turmeric and coconut milk  and eggs in chili sambal (think shakshuka).  Rice and noodle dishes include tomato rice (nasi tomato)  wok-fried flat noodles  curry laksa  chicken rice  herbal rice  and several egg-fried rices in addition to fried noodles. Desserts range from the effortless (fresh mango  honey and coconut  tropical fruit salad) to the more elaborate (pandan custard and sticky rice layered sweet  sticky rice balls  soy panna cotta with passion fruit and crushed chocolate cookies. And you’ll find any number of refreshing drinks  from lemongrass and honey tea and rose syrup drink to pulled sweet tea and iced fresh lime juice.  At the end are several staple condiments  from the ubiquitous chili paste and ginger soy sauce  to sambals (chili  coconut)  sauces  and vegetable pickles.  Norman Musa’s recipes tend to be a bit more advanced but also result in more complex  nuanced flavors. This is a gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!,1
a little expensive,Great individual packets  perfect for many uses.. Convenient for traveling  these Tylenol tablet packets are great to take with you on the go. I keep a pack in my handbag at all times and I don't need to worry about them getting dirty or having them loose. I recently went on a cruise and took a few with me in my suitcase and it was perfect. Dual purpose  these are great for minor colds or allergies as well as using as an analgesic. These are a little expensive  but you are paying for the convenience of being able to have them in individual packets. Highly recommend to anyone who wants their pain/congestion pills in convenient packets to take on the go with them.,0

extend it at an angel,"Helpful Around Home. I'm 5'6""  so I'm not short  but our kitchen cabinets are way out of my reach. I hate having to drag the step stool in just to reach things on the top shelf. This tool is very helpful in those situations. And it's much smaller than the step stool and fits nicely in the pantry. I like that you can rotate the part that grips onto items. I also like that you can extend it at an angel is you want. It works pretty well for most items. I have found that the claw part (for lack of the official term) doesn't expand enough to fit around some things. I was trying to reach the container of salt so I could refill the shaker and it barely fit around that. Other than that  I like it.",1
red silicone handle,stainless steel steak press. I purchased this press AFTER buying a cast iron one that requires careful cleaning and reseasoning after each use.

It's the same weight as the cast iron one - I am giving the cast iron one up and keeping this one!  Works perfectly!,1
great for River Run Rustic Wood Crafts,Cuteness. Love the different size prints  I am a hobby crafter and make various items  signs and home decor. These are great for my River Run Rustic Wood Crafts.,1
doggie loved it,Lil pug. This little guy is the cutest thing ever.  Gave it to my niece as a gift because she just bought a real life doggie like it.  Both she snd her doggie loved it!,1
pleasant aroma,Just a lovely clean masculine fragrance that smells like a good soap. I use essential oils in my diffusers and this sandalwood essential oil is perfect for that. This is also great for those who make body butters or other lotions.  The fragrance is  clean and masculine and smells like a good soap. I use anywhere from 3 - 5 drops in my diffuser depending on the size of my water reservoir. The resulting aroma is lovely.  The current price of $15.99 for this large 3.38 fluid ounce bottle is reasonable as it comes to less than $5 per ounce.,1
turns the screen on and off,Great. Fits the tab well and has a hand strap. Also turns the screen on and off. Good buy!,1
clamps feel very strong,Nice solid 4 ft x 10 ft foil duct.... The most economical foil duct at your local HD might be the Everbilt brand that is 4 ft x 8 ft long. They also have a 4 ft x 25 ft if you need something longer  but for a dryer vent  10 ft is more than enough. This looks heavy duty  the clamps feel very strong. We'll see how this works. Looking forward to installing this. 5-stars!,1
Toys were very cute and durable,Pups loved it!. Toys were very cute and durable. My Chi  who tears all her toys   hasn’t been able to conquer these two. Extremely happy that treats are sourced and made in USA and Canada. Wouldn’t purchase if different.,1
Great magazine,Great magazine. Love this magazine!  Great price too!,1
business card size picture of the puzzle,Animal Crossing Vibe. This cat island puzzle has an Animal Crossing vibe to it. The image is fun and colorful  plus it has lots of cats! The pieces are a good size and cut well. I didn't notice any puzzle dust. I did not care for the company logo being on the back of every piece. That actually made it a little more difficult to sort because you had to look at both sides to make sure you were putting the right side up. It doesn't come with a poster of the image either. I really appreciate that addition to puzzles. It's a pain to have to hold the box in your hand just so you can see where things go. The full image is on the bottom of the box. The lid has a blown up picture that doesn't show everything. Plus  the brand logo is on both of the images. They really are pushing their logo on us!! They do include a business card size picture of the puzzle but that's really impossible to use because it's so small.,0
content is heavy on paint color samples,Lacks interesting content. One of the most worthless magazines I have ever subscribed to. It's the same ol'  same ol' issue after issue. It's content is heavy on paint color samples  and little else. Don't waste your money.,0
Can be purchased through Amazon,Works Just as Advertised. Really a good product and I'm very happy that it can now be purchased through Amazon.,1
cannot load more than 1 rubber band at a time,rubber band six shooter. I purchased as a prop to a costume really  and as the appearance of a six shooter - it's ok.  I don't want it to look like a real gun.  As a rubberband gun... Eh.  You cannot load more than 1 rubber band at a time and it shoots the rubber band about 30% of the time.  The trigger is  really wonky - it bends back and forth - thus part of the firing problem.  It is black and gold plastic.  So... in conclusion - if you're looking for a toy gun... it's ok.  If you're looking to fire rubber bands  keep looking.,0
standard adapters,Great gaming headset. Great value gaming headset. Comes with all the standard adapters. Fit is comfortable and connects easily to Xbox and iPad. Mic works will with online game play. These aren’t an all around headset. The audio isn’t going to blow you away if you’re an  audiofile. This is a value headset for gaming.,1
conversation starter,Nice alternative to standard paper masks. I am writing this review during the 2020 pandemic. I had never used one of gaiter face masks before (I had more traditional paper or cloth wrap around the ears ones). I was actually pleasantly surprised how comfortable these are to wear and easy to pull up and down when you are in and out of locations where you need a mask. These are easy to put on  they do fit snugly (which may or may not be a comfort issue for you). They are not very comfortable in a hot environment because these are not cotton based (I live in Florida and they are hot when being worn outside). However  when shopping  these are great. Not sure how resistant they are to the virus  I typically will wear a filter or even a tissue on the inside when I am going into a crowded area for extra protection. These are cute and colorful and definitely a conversation starter.,1

canon ink cartridges,canon ink cartridges. Goes with a wireless canon printer that I ordered... which is total junk... keeping it for the copying and scanning ability  thus keeping the ink.  I always update my reviews should something arise.,1
edge is a bit sharp,Excellent optics  great for spinning tops. While this product is probably intended for optical use  the 250mm focal length from my trials is the best curvature for spinning tops to quickly and consistently achieve a stable centered vertical state.  It is lightweight at 50 grams and thin 2.5mm thickness at the edge.  The top edge is a bit sharp  and to reduce the chances of it breaking under the stress of a top hitting against the surface  I wrapped the entire back of mine up to that top edge with adhesive vinyl (black electrical tape would work fine too).  A fee fine scratches have appeared on the mirror from lots of use with some heavier tops  but none that impair the spin to any significant degree.  I usually set this on top of my foreverspin base which matches the curvature  and if the tabletop isn't exactly level  I can adjust the mirror position to achieve a centered spin.  Optically very little distortion and bright.  Great product  well made.,0
absolutely loved the first book,Like it. Good epilogue. Considering that I absolutely loved the first book I knew I would appreciate another peek at my favorite gargoyle and mate.,1
easy to use,Works Great!. I love Command strips and use them all the time. I didn't even know there were black ones. These work really nice with black frames on colored walls. The white strips that I've used in the past are somewhat noticeable when used on anything other than white walls. These work as expected. They are easy to use  too.,1

great price,Great Music great price. It is a great cd!! Had a in issue with shipping and Amazon took care of everything.,1
clock display,Great way to combine both your alarm and your white noise machine!. I love this JKZ combination white noise and alarm machine. I had been using a standard white noise machine for years now (it's the only way I can get a decent nights sleep). I had been looking for one to replace my existing one that would have a clock display on it (so I can see the hours and get rid of my separate clock which takes up too much space on my end table). I love the way this looks (attractive and modern)   the variety of sounds is great and the display is large and clear. Highly recommend!,1
breads and pancakes,"Note: This is the US version / reprint of ""Curry Easy Vegetarian"". Earlier this summer  I ordered the excellent &#34[[ASIN:0091949475 Curry Easy Vegetarian]] from the UK as I adore Madhur Jaffrey (and vegetarian Indian cookbooks in general  especially the two fantastic Gujarati cookbooks by [[ASIN:1444734717 Prashad Cookbook: Indian Vegetarian Cooking]]. True to form  this is an excellent  informative guide to vegetarian cooking across India that includes over 200 recipes for vegetables (roasted  stir-fried  curry)  dals  grains (pilaf  flattened rice  upmas)  breads and pancakes  numerous delicious egg and cheese dishes  chutneys  and drinks  sweets and desserts. From what I can tell  &#34Vegetarian India&#34 appears to be identical (as referenced in the book's title page) but in US measurements  so if you already own &#34Curry Easy Vegetarian &#34 you will be getting the exact same recipes. This is a lovely  user-friendly introduction to vegetarian Indian cuisine highly recommended.",1
"""NO more hair pulling""",Chums original. Work exactly as they should.  I put them on a pair of Oakly's that had rubber temples and pulled my hair ALLLLL the time.

saves potential damage to my furniture,Great dog bed  my puppy loves it!. This is a perfect bed for my 4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix dog. She is 35 lbs and this large size fits her perfectly. Soft and comfortable for her  she loved it from the minute I opened the box. And it is easy to clean. As an fyi  I don't crate my dog so I am using this as a standalone bed. However   I know that if I used this in a crate it would make crating far more comfortable as well. The color is great  too  and makes a nice addition to my living room as a comfortable place for her to sit (instead of sitting on the couch with me  lol). Because of this  it saves potential damage to my furniture and Roxie absolutely loves this bed. Kudos to MidWest Homes to a great dog bed!,1
charges a phone very quickly,Weak Magnet. This charges a phone very quickly but that is about the only positive thing about it.  The magnet is not very strong at all.  Barely holds onto a 14 pro max with a MagSafe case on it.  Barely bumped the phone will fall.  Works a little better with a 14 mini.  The AirPod charger charges very slow even though it gets the AirPods very warm.,1
self stick circular tabs,"led push lights. Using these in our ceramic pumpkins... they are bright and perfect with the remote.  Came with 6 lights and 2 remotes.  Each light takes 3 AAA batteries which are NOT included.  The remotes do have batteries.  You can turn the lights on  off or choose a timer.  They are perfect for our use.  They include self stick circular tabs  for use if you want to ""stick"" them somewhere.  You can also ""press"" the center of the light (which does stick up a bit) to turn on/off.  Each light is about 3"" in circumference.  The outer is bright white plastic.  I think these were a good value.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.  And I hope my review was helpful to you!",1
Pirates fan,Pirates of the Caribbean 4 set. I am HUGE Pirates fan AND a Johnny Depp fan... so double bonus for me.  You have to own all 4 if you're going to watch them. Each one good in it's own way.  Clearly the first is one of the best.  However  I personally love the last of the 4 so far.  I love the mermaids.  Oooo.  Watch out guys.  In any case... I would say ok for age 8 and up... but that is a personal thought... to each their own I don't judge.,1
great towel,Very soft and absorbent.. This is very soft and it's absorbent.  I love having a special towel for the dog.  I hate using my towels on my dog.  I don't even like washing her towels in my washing machine  but gotta do what I gotta do.  This is a great towel. I need a bigger one for my horse/dog  but the small is great for our yorkie mix.,1
no problems using it,Excellent. I purchased the powermower 3 years ago and only purchased the hedge trimmer because of the batteries. Was I surprised what power it had and easy to use I am a female and have no problems using it. I recommend it highly. Battery I use is from mow power mower.,1
mother will love these,Great quality. Coolest thing. Best ever. Handmade charm is lovely  my mother will love these.,1
softer improvement in skin,Good night time moisturizer. This is a nice night time skin moisturizer. Thick and creamy  this is meant to be used at night (does not absorb quickly into the skin). I have used Crepe Erase in the past and don't feel that this lives up to its more famous brand  but overall it is a decent moisturize. I have seen a softer improvement in my skin and the crepiness  does seem to be diminished  but I am afraid it is just a temporary improvement (if I stop  I am sure it will quickly return). Overall  it's a nice moisturizer but may be overpriced.,1
called me and said that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew,"Ahhhh ... my favorite magazine. I'm not an archaeologist. If I was born redundantly wealthy I think that I might have been one.  Archaeology is my ""stop everything and read it on the day it arrives"" magazine. I've been a subscriber for years. I read EVERY article. As a reader of archaeology and paleontology tomes  this magazine is the adjunct to my selections of books to read. My wife and I have planned vacations around Archaeology's articles.  I've detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites.  During a cross country moving event 7 years ago  I let the subscription expire for lack of new address. Someone from Archaeology  not a telemarketer for sure  called me and said that I had been such a long term customer that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew ... was it something about the magazine quality? The voice on the other end was just so dang disappointed as she pleaded for feedback that it was stunning enough for me to remember 7 years later. The magazine must be read by a small but dedicated subscriber base and I think the magazine staff themselves makes the calls.  My only complaint is that it only prints every 2 months. If archaeology is among your interests  you would entertain your fancies with a subscription.",0

slight intentional grit adds scrubbing action,"Aromatic bars of ""Soap Shields"" that gently scrub & cleanse. These small bars of soap smell really good and perform well in terms of cleansing and not leaving skin feeling stripped. I like that they are made in USA  handmade in Ohio. These are not fancy soaps. They are small  but they are not necessarily travel sized. They just have a good size and shape that fits perfectly into the hand. That stood out to me on first use. I really like how well it fits in my hand. The bars are tear dropped or pear shaped. More specifically  it is shaped to be a like a defense shield. Get it?  As this is meant to be a bit of an immune defense/support item.  The bars are thin  but not fragile. I can palm it and easily rub it all over without it falling out of my hand. I have been using one bar on and off for a couple of weeks now  and it isn't just disappearing. There are six loose bars in a resealable bag.  The soap has a slight intentional grit to it . This adds some scrubbing action. Creates a nice lather and rinses well. The scent is an intriguing mix of essential oils. Clove  Cinnamon  Oregano  Peppermint  Parsley  Eucalyptus and Rosemary essential oils Not overpowering. Really quite nice.  It has been an odd  but unexpectedly pleasant product to use. The price is budget friendly. I find nothing bad about them or my experience so far. I may consider them again when I run out. I really think they are worth the try.

"""overhang"" severely limits where you can put the mount","Decent arm hampered by a couple issues. [[VIDEOID:943921a96fbe3453c9c79a9de29a598]] I've been using the arm for a few days  and I have a few thoughts about it.  First  the good. The arm is quiet  the covers work well to cover the springs  and it holds my Samson Q2U in place without issue.  Next  the meh. The base of the mount is plastic  and with that  there is a wobble (see video) when adjusting the mount  which is not something I'd expect at this price point.  Another issue is with the base clamp. While the clamp itself is sturdy and padded so as not to hurt your desk  there is an ""overhang"" (maybe for use as a headphone holder?)  which severely limits where you can put the mount. As a result  I couldn't put the mount on either side of my desk (my preferred location  and instead had to put it in the computer bay at the front.  Overall  this isn't a terrible arm  and if you can get past the issues I mentioned above  I'd recommend it.",0

cooked more evenly,Great indoor  relatively smokeless grill  but difficult to clean. I recently sold my house and moved into an apartment where I intend to stay for about three months until my new house is ready. I love to grill in my old house and new house I had And will use a gas grill.  I knew living in a strange place for a few months and being out of my regular routine  I would really miss the healthier meals that I would make. When I saw this Krupp’s grill  I was a little hesitant.  Currently living in an apartment  I didn’t want to have to worry about smoke detectors going off  or anything else that might impact the building on them. From a personal perspective  I was worried that I wouldn’t like the taste of the food given that I’m used to growing on outdoor grills. Boy  but what a mistake I made! This is an absolutely great grill. I found very little smoke and cooking hamburgers  and they tasted great. I even think they cooked more evenly then they would’ve on the grill.  My only complaint  and that’s why am removing one star  is the cleanup. I did line the pan with aluminum foil which did help. However the inside of the grill underneath the heating element. It’s very difficult to clean. With the splashing of grease from the burgers it did take me a while to try to get this clean  and I’m still not sure if it was 100% clean. I probably won’t be using this quite as often as I would have an outside grill  but in a pinch  this is a great grill to use indoors for an apartment or a home.,1

very natural gloss,Krylon Crystal clear gloss spray.. So... I used this on some sort of polished river rocks in my yard... they just weren't &quotshiny&quot enough.. after a few months in the Arizona sun.  Sooo.. I thought I'd try this.  I was very happy with the results.  The river rocks look &quotwet&quot and polished again.Not fake... very natural gloss - So happy with the results.  I am hoping it lasts longer that the so called &quotpolish&quot that was original to the rocks I mean  I paid extra for the &quotpolished&quot rocks! *sigh*  In the mean time this was very easy to apply.  I got the hose out... rinsed the rocks all off and allowed them to dry.  Used a blower to get rid of extra dust and pine needles (from neighbors pine tree) and sprayed evenly.  Solidly dry in 30 minutes.  Really happy with the results. Even though this probably not the usual application!,1

Janelle,once you start. keep season going. I have binged watchtched seasons 12 and up.  Repeated some of them.  I then went back to beginning.  tried 1-5 and chose to finish later.  -*  This is my one comment for season 6.  at the end  3 of the last 4 contestants  didnt understand why America always Loved Janelle.  I am not usually a bestie w someone like her  however i found a best friend that was similar.  I have Huge respect for her because she is unapologetically herself.  That doesn't mean she doesn't have insecurities or another human emotion that we can all feel.  I guess what i repect is she is not a liar.  So far everyone else covers up with a lie.  If she has  i have not seen it yet.  Yay for you beautiful Lady.  I hope you win!!!!,1
good quality insole made with recycled materials,Great insole for foot comfort and great for the environment!. Good quality insole made with recycled materials. I've always loved Dr. Scholl's products and this insole is no exception. Soft yet firm  makes it so much easier for me to go through the day on my feet. I love the fact that it is made with recycled materials and is better for the environment. I will be using these going forward since I like them so much. Highly recommend.,1
"quickly know which one is 
the softer sensitive one VS which on is the deep clean",Great Fit!. This replacement brush heads are a great fit on my Oral B Pro Limited toothbrush. They are way more affordable than the Oral B ones. They work well  too. I am very pleased with them. My only issue is that they're not labeled well in my opinion. They have a code on them which identifies what they are  but that doesn't help unless you know the codes. I want to be able to quickly know which one is the softer  sensitive one VS which on is the deep clean. I think I'm just going to have to look them up and write on the packaging.,0
love the product,Love the product but it hasn’t worked long for me.....twice. I am bummed to be only able to give this 2 stars because I love the product and the fact that you have 2 batteries. However  I bought one and it only lasted a couple of months of user time before it wouldn’t work and just make a loud screeching sound in my ear. I decided to order another one hoping it was just a fluke (because  as I mentioned  I really like the product) but after another couple of months of use  the batteries won’t charge and I have 2 charging cords. I love the product but am leery of paying another $25 if it’s only going to last a couple of months.  Update: ugh....I decided to order this for a third time and it isn’t even being delivered in time (as it was promised).,1
Ink lasts 3X as long as Lexmark,Canon MP480 all in one. I owned Lexmark Pinter about 4 of them and 3 HP. I like this one the best  even it was less expensive than my other printer. Reason: I never had a printer in which the Ink lasted 3X as long as Lexmark  the other printer nickel and dimes you to dead over the ink to expensive and does not last.  Cannon ist excellent,1
glow,Great facial serum made a noticeable difference in my skin!. This is a really nice facial serum containing collagen. I typically use a serum every morning on my face after showering and have done so for at least 20 years or so now (at the recommendation of my dermatologist). I really like this new serum from Manilla. I always thought Asian women had beautiful skin and now I think it might have to do with the rice milk ingredient (something I never tried before). This serum goes on light and absorbs easily into my skin. It has a light fragrance that I really like  too. My skin over the past few weeks has begun to look noticeably healthier  smoother and has a definite glow. I will be ordering more. Highly recommend!,1
bunny keychain,Good job. Nice selection  some good products. I liked some of the cookies best. Like that it seems you are avoiding sugar alcohols which neither of us can tolerate. We had a coupon that made the pricing very fair and reasonable. Not sure if we can afford to keep it up all year since we only eat about 2/3 of the box. The bunny keychain was cute. I removed the keychain and it's one of my dogs favorite toys (yes  we watch her closely with it).,1

boost overall mood,Helpful!. I used to live in the midwest. In the winter  it was dark when I went to work and dark when I came home. I was never diagnosed with SAD  but I believe I suffered from it. I live in the south now and it has been better. Though this winter  we've had a lot of grey days. On those days  it's easy to feel lethargic. This light has been helpful! It provides outdoor light  indoors! It's easy to use. The buttons are on the lower front. This comes with the power brick which was nice. A lot of electronic items I've gotten recently don't come with one any more. I have this light set up in my home office. Not only does it help boost my overall mood  but it gives me a bright work space which I like. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the little stand on the back of it. It feels like it's going to break easily. So far it's doing okay  but when you move it to get it positioned  it seems questionable. Other than that  I am enjoying this lamp.,1
tracking is very good,A Lot of Mouse. I have never used a gaming mouse before. Actually I've looked down on people who did for the same reason I don't like some players being on steroids in major league sports. But now that I'm getting older  my reactions are slower  my fingers are not as quick on the keys and...Oh...I guess I like it for exactly the same reasons athletes love steroids...  But on a serious note.  Mousing and key gnashing do take a toll. I don't know that this mouse is a complete solution to it. But I have had relief of being able to have some things macroed to a single mouse button.  If nothing else  it has created a different movement.  I like the quality of the mouse.  The tracking is very good  the feel is okay  the looks are richly industrial.  I'm not huge on the extending base to the mouse.  I just wish it had been a little bigger to fit my hand  but it fits fine without extending. Personally  a little heavier would feel a little better as well.  All in all I'm very impressed  and wished I had given into &#34juicing&#34 my game a long time ago.,1
lower the sound from the microphone,Great microphone speaker. My son loves to sing so I bought him this for xmas. It was easy to pair up with my iPhone 6s. I was able to play music from my music library or the amazon music app. Great sound. I wasn't sure how to lower the sound though from the microphone. I had to do it from my phone. And I wish there was an option to do a light show instead of just picking one LED color. Love being able to charge using USB instead of batteries. I definitely recommend this bluetooth karaoke microphone.,0
zips up but not around the base,Great for Traveling. This make up brush bag is great for traveling. It's long enough to accommodate assorted sizes of brushes. It zips up  but not around the base. It can be stood up for easy access  but it's not always steady. I like that it's clear vinyl at the top so you can see the contents.,1

variety and possible variations,Make showstopping desserts on your countertop with minimal effort!. I’m a fairly recent convert to the slow cooker bandwagon I only purchased my first slow cooker a couple of years ago and started out by baking my way through all the desserts in Michele Scicolone’s excellent “The Mediterranean Slow Cooker ” which introduced me to the joys of making flan  cheesecake  and fruit compote in the slow cooker.  Fast forward several years later and I was looking to expand my slow cooker desserts repertoire  so imagine my delight when I got an e-mail from Lisa Ekus that highlighted “Slow Cooker Desserts” by Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore! Roxanne and Kathy are cookbook authors  food consultants  cooking teachers and food bloggers who have written seven cookbooks and a popular blog  www.pluggedintocooking.com.  As soon as my copy of “Slow Cooker Desserts” arrived  I couldn’t wait to dig in to the many inviting recipes covering not only cakes and cheesecakes  but also bread puddings  fruits  and candy and fondues. The book opens with a good compact guide to slow cookers  bakeware  and ingredients. The layout is uncluttered and straightforward  and each recipe is followed by helpful tips  making it perfect for novice bakers. The gorgeous photography by Jennifer Davick deserves a special mention as well.  The first recipe I tried was the Praline-Pumpkin Cheesecake. I decided to substitute a gingersnap crust for the graham crackers  and it added the perfect touch of spice to complement the spices in the cheesecake filling. Note that you do need to blind bake the gingersnap crust prior to baking in the slow cooker  but this only adds a few minutes to the prep time. Also  perhaps it was the brand of gingersnaps I used  but I would recommend adding a little extra melted butter until the crust comes together – the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter for ½ cup crumbs. One thing I would suggest is to also liberally spray the sides of your springform pan as well – mine is supposedly nonstick  but I followed the recipe (which only specifies to spray the bottom of the pan) and a large portion of my cheesecake edges stuck and broke. I normally do spray the entire pan with Baker’s Joy  but I follow the recipes as written when I am testing for reviews.  The finished cheesecake texture is very fluffy and a bit crumbly  so I did have difficulty cutting it neatly I’m not sure if I may have beat TOO much air into my filling and will beat for less next time. The praline topping (made in the microwave in under three minutes) is destined to become my new secret weapon in the kitchen! This homemade caramel was delicious and deceptively easy and would also make a great addition to ice cream or cakes. All combined (gingersnap crust  spiced pumpkin filling  praline topping)  this is a great fall dessert with minimal effort and also frees up your oven for other baking tasks.  The second recipe I tried was the candied cranberry and crystallized ginger chutney this one called my name because I am a certified fiend when it comes to candied ginger. I had a bag of organic cranberries in the freezer that I was looking to use up  so it worked out perfectly that I already had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry (even the ginger liqueur!). My bag of organic cranberries was slightly smaller than the 16-oz. bag called for in the recipe  so I scaled back on the sugar quite a bit as I was using candied ginger (I used ¾ cup sugar in place of the 1 ¼ in the recipe  and it was plenty sweet for me). It also had the bonus of making my kitchen smell amazing as it cooked! I cooked mine down for a little longer the recipe says that it should be thin  but I like my chutney on the very thick side more like a compote. The recipe calls for between 5 to 7 hours on low and I ended up cooking mine for 3 hours on high due to time. This would be fantastic stirred into yogurt  as an accompaniment to Indian food  or even as a side dish in place of jellied cranberries or cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.  The third recipe was the chocolate cashew clusters. I’d seen slow cooker candy (including nut clusters) pop up in my Facebook feed  but I’d never tried making it before. The recipe uses salted cashews  semisweet and milk chocolate chips  a dark chocolate candy bar  and candy coating to create decadent nut clusters that look like they came from a candy shop. These take about 1 ½ hours on low plus cooling / set time (3 to 5 hours).  Other recipes on my to-make list from “Slow Cooker Desserts” include the cinnamon-calvados applesauce  rice pudding with cherries  and many of the cheesecakes (brownie chunk  German chocolate  ginger-peach  coconut cream) and cakes (cider-glazed apple-walnut cake  Southern sweet potato cake  pineapple butter cake). There is enough variety and possible variations (I need to find a way to make a cookie butter cheesecake!) to keep you happily baking for months to come.

great purchase,Good purchase.... Not unhappy with this purchase at all...... Needs more bass but otherwise a great purchase.,1
initial,Great Set!. A few weeks ago  my children and I started crafting with resin. One of our friends saw our initial pieces and requested an initial. Well  we needed a new mold then! This is a great mold that has all of the letters A-Z and digits 0-9. The molds aren't too shallow so the finished letters are a good thickness. The set also comes with some fun accessories such as the tassels and key rings. There's also some glitter and a tool for putting the holes in to the finished letters. I ended up ordering some different key rings  because I wanted clips so we could clip our initials to our bags if we wanted. Overall  this is a fun set to have.,1
highly recommend,Highly recommend. Love this box!,1
company logo on the back of every piece,Animal Crossing Vibe. This cat island puzzle has an Animal Crossing vibe to it. The image is fun and colorful  plus it has lots of cats! The pieces are a good size and cut well. I didn't notice any puzzle dust. I did not care for the company logo being on the back of every piece. That actually made it a little more difficult to sort because you had to look at both sides to make sure you were putting the right side up. It doesn't come with a poster of the image either. I really appreciate that addition to puzzles. It's a pain to have to hold the box in your hand just so you can see where things go. The full image is on the bottom of the box. The lid has a blown up picture that doesn't show everything. Plus  the brand logo is on both of the images. They really are pushing their logo on us!! They do include a business card size picture of the puzzle but that's really impossible to use because it's so small.,0
Moisturizing,Moisturizing. I've been using this cream primarily around my eyes. It's a thin consistency and is more like a lotion than a cream. It has a light pleasant scent. Most importantly  it doesn't irritate or sting my eyes. I've had several eye creams that when my eyes tear or if I sweat  it runs into my eyes causing some stinging or burning. This does not  so that is quite good. It's a gentle  moisturizing product.,1
Not what I thought,Is straight. It's aight. Not what I thought it was gone be. Ion be out at night so want get to enjoy color changing.,0
honest personal experience,"Hallmark brand greeting cards. I have purchased these cards before and the quality is Hallmark.  I keep them on hand for the time I didn't have time to grab one or need one unexpectedly.  They are great!  I think they are good for either men or women  despite the ad mentioning for ""women.""

All my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different.  I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers.",1
turquoise (smooth) and copper colored (hammered),Two-toned delight!. These two toned faux hammered earrings are delightful. These are turquoise (smooth) and copper colored (hammered). They are hand-painted/handmade. The posts are stainless steel and nickel free. I have sensitive skin and didn’t notice any irritation or redness. While the packaging is simple  I did like that it included a “thank you” label on the box. These earrings are very classy and can be worn everyday. Overall  these are some cute earrings for under $16.,1
USB C cords,USB C cords. If you just purchased the latest gen of android cell phone (for me  the Samsung S10+) you will need a new type of charging cords... they do charge on the cord free units - but if you're away from those  you will need these cords.  There is also a micro usb to usb C adapter - will save you a few bucks - but eventually you'll want new cords. These work great so far - however  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
wobble when adjusting the mount,"Decent arm hampered by a couple issues. [[VIDEOID:943921a96fbe3453c9c79a9de29a598]] I've been using the arm for a few days  and I have a few thoughts about it.  First  the good. The arm is quiet  the covers work well to cover the springs  and it holds my Samson Q2U in place without issue.  Next  the meh. The base of the mount is plastic  and with that  there is a wobble (see video) when adjusting the mount  which is not something I'd expect at this price point.  Another issue is with the base clamp. While the clamp itself is sturdy and padded so as not to hurt your desk  there is an ""overhang"" (maybe for use as a headphone holder?)  which severely limits where you can put the mount. As a result  I couldn't put the mount on either side of my desk (my preferred location  and instead had to put it in the computer bay at the front.  Overall  this isn't a terrible arm  and if you can get past the issues I mentioned above  I'd recommend it.",0

eyeshadow,I really hope this service and products improve in my next box!. I recieved 4 items plus a makeup bag with my first month of this subscription. The description of what is supposed to come in each months box clearly stated that there were supposed to be 5 (five) full sized products  consisting of all lip products and one random makeup item. I received a full sized lip liner  a normal sized lipstick and very small  what I would call sample size lip scrub and eyeshadow. They were extremely small. Also  the lipstick was smudge proof  but remained SO sticky the entire time I wore it. I mean  my lips kept sticking together and even stuck to my napkin when I wiped my mouth. I didn't like it. The price is not bad  and I'm going to continue my subscription for a few more months to see if the products improve  but if they remain consistently poor  then the value isn't actually good for the price and I will cancel.,0
pacing keeps you on the edge of your seat,I greatly enjoyed Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions. As a huge fan of the inspector Montalbano series and other international detective stories  I greatly enjoyed Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions.  The pacing keeps you on the edge of your seat  and  although some elements require you to seriously suspend credibility  overall this is a highly entertaining romp.  Beautiful Sicily is the real star here   and you’ll find plenty of romance and hijinks with the high-spirited German expat Auntie Poldi  who has a few tricks up her fashionable sleeve  and who has set her sights on hunky police detective Vito Montana  and the tension between the two simmers and sizzles for much of the book.  The daughter of a German police detective  Poldi possesses great instincts and a knack for sleuththing that has her trying to find a killer involved with the mafia.  I can’t wait to read more of her adventures in the second book Fruits of the Lord.,1
loaded with antioxidants,Another great L'Oreal product!. I love L'Oreal products and have been using them for years. This daily moisturizer is great. It is loaded with antioxidants and contains a lot of great anti-aging ingredients. I have been using this daily for over a month now and I love the way my skin looks and feels. If I had any complaints it would be that I would have liked a higher than 25 SPF for use down here in Florida (so I ave to supplement it with additional sunscreen when I leave the house. Outside of that  this is a really nice moisturizer which goes on lightly and is quickly absorbed. Highly recommend.,1

fit snug,This zipper is hard to zip. This feed back is for the BERTER Women's Sauna Suit Sweat Body Shaper Vest for Waist Trainer Zipper Neoprene Tank Top for Exercise Gym Workout Suit Fitness Weight Loss.  I expected it to fit snug  but the zipper is a struggle and then the part that was zipped unzipped going down from the bottom of the zipper before I finished zipping it.  Maybe  the sizing is off  but I feel like if the zipper would have worked properly  it would have done its job.,1
a little on the short side,Pretty shirt a little on the short side. Really nice shirt. A little thicker material than I thought (polyester)  but the colors are really pretty and virant and it lays off my shoulders nicely. If I had any complaint at all I wish it were longer. I tend to like a t-shirt which comes down almost to cover my butt  this stops at about half way down my stomach. So keep that in mind if you are looking to hide a couple of extra pounds (this isn't the shirt for that).,0
witches,"Sims 2 goes out with a bang. The ""unofficial"" word is that Apartment Life will be the final expansion pack for the Sims 2 line. I don't really know if that's true  but if so Apartment Life closes the series on an up note.  Along with Seasons and Nightlife  Apartment Life is one of my favorite expansions. I really like the apartment feature  it's been long overdue. It's so much easier now to start off a sim newly graduated from University by having them live in an apartment. It's so much easier to get them suitable living quarters.  I am so glad we finally have spiral stairs and playground equipment. They were both very much needed 4+ expansions ago.  The social townies can be kind of annoying in a way  but the reputation feature is nice. One thing I don't like is how the new social greetings will mess up the greetings from locals at the Bon Voyage vacation neighborhoods. It's very rare now for my locals to do their normal greetings  instead they do the new social ones and my vacationing sims have a harder time of meeting the ""learn local greeting"" want without cheating on my part. But it's a minor frustration.  Witches are pretty interesting. I like the neutral spells but some of the evil and good witch spells are kind of blah. Plus  I'm really not into the skin overlays with the evil and good witches. I don't like the green or sparkly skin so I use a mod to stop it. But overall I do like the witches and am glad we have them. They're the only paranormal creature in the Sims 2 line I've had more than a passing interest in.  Apartment Life is a great EP and given the choice I'd gladly buy it again. I think it will keep my creativity & gameplay with Sims 2 going for a very long time.",1
not a real snow globe,Nice  but don't expect a snow globe!. Was disappointed when I had to reorder it because it got lost then itcame(the 1st one) so I had to send it back. Was also disappointed because I thought it was a real snow globe. Should have read up on it. My fault.,0

extend it at an angel,"Helpful Around Home. I'm 5'6""  so I'm not short  but our kitchen cabinets are way out of my reach. I hate having to drag the step stool in just to reach things on the top shelf. This tool is very helpful in those situations. And it's much smaller than the step stool and fits nicely in the pantry. I like that you can rotate the part that grips onto items. I also like that you can extend it at an angel is you want. It works pretty well for most items. I have found that the claw part (for lack of the official term) doesn't expand enough to fit around some things. I was trying to reach the container of salt so I could refill the shaker and it barely fit around that. Other than that  I like it.",1
Cute,Cute. Got for grand son. He likes them. Lots of fun times. No issues,1
quality made,Really nicely made boat shoes!. For the money  these are really nice boat shoes. I love the color and the canvas material and they fit my husband's size 10 feet perfectly. He has several other boat shoes in his wardrobe  but almost all cost twice at what these shoes are currently priced.  Really nice shoes  quality made  reasonably priced. Highly recommend!,1
Sam Cooke,Britain does it again!. What started out as a uniquely American genre  that of blues  soul  and gospel  has somehow managed to become the creative property of Britain ... ever since the decline of classic Motown  Britain has been churning out an amazingly talented bunch of blue-eyed soul singers and blues musicians. One of the more recent additions is James Hunter  who first burst onto the scene under the stage name Howlin' Wilf in the 1980s ([[ASIN:B000HOJNI4 Cry Wilf!]]). His several solo recordings are strongly influenced by R&B  early rock and roll  and soul. His 1994 debut Believe What I Say includes guest performances by Van Morrison (Hunter also appeared on several of Van's albums during the '90s and was part of Morrison's Rhythm & Blues Revue).  Believe What I Say opens with the jivin' Two Can Play  with its sassy staccato sax riffs punctuating this tale of infidelity. Hunter's smooth  sensual update of torch song The Very Thought Of You comes off as more late-night smoky jazz  with a delivery that Ray Charles would be proud of. Turn On Your Love Light features a smokin' duet with Van Morrison.  One of the few covers is Ray Charles' Hallelujah I Love Her So. Compared to Charles' original  which leaned towards Big Band brassy  Hunter's backing saxes sound the same on every track  and I felt the instrumentals lacking punch in the first half  but the bridge (with guitar) redeems the song and gospel feeling creeps in toward the finale.  Out of Sight is a tight soul ditty that pays homage to James Brown with its knockout brass/drum punches. Hear Me Calling has some hand-waving gospel vibes going  complete with call-and-response chorus.  The majority of the songs sound like they could have come off the radio from the mid-'50s to late '60s. They're pleasant enough  but the sameness of the backing detracts from the potential to differentiate between tracks. Hunter's writing chops create songs that feel authentically retro. His singing voice combines elements of Ray Charles and Sam Cooke  and his guitar shows heavy influence from Chuck Berry and legendary blues guitarists such as B.B. King.  Hunter has continued to polish his sound on his subsequent solo releases [[ASIN:B0000259AM Kick It Around]] and [[ASIN:B000E1NX1S People Gonna Talk]]  but it's enjoyable to hear his first solo work after his turn with Howlin' Wilf and the Vee-Jays. He's one of the most authentic of the current crop of blue-eyed soul artists  and really inhabits that long-lost R&B/soul/blues era as if it were only yesterday instead of decades ago.,1
thick,Wow. These christmas bags were super thick.  Very worth the money especially since I received a discount.,1
thin & scratchy,Cheaply made  loose threads  thin & scratchy. Title says it all  really. It's thin  it's a very loose knit  there are loose threads everywhere... it's on the wider side so it won't stay up over your nose or keep your neck warm  although wearing it as a hood  around your head   or as balakava is ok. It's more expensive than and less nice than similar products from other brands. Washing it did make it a bit softer  but I have no idea how a reputable brand that is so popular can also be so cheap and poorly made.,0
Great colors,Super projecting lights for all party uses! Amazingly good!. This is a super cool product. I live in a new 'cool' 55 and older community in the Daytona Beach area and we have parties at neighbor homes several times a week. When I first set these up I wasn't sure what to expect. But after seeing the  variety of lights  patterns and speeds I knew this would be a hit. We had a Motown party last weekend and this projector was the highlight of the night! Great colors  great remote control capability and even responds to voice commands. This would be a great addition to any home (young or old) for use when there is a party to be had. I definitely highly recommend this gadget for all ages and holidays!,1
Received lots of compliments,Gorgeous time piece!  It's timeless. I haven't figured out how to get it programmed but it's a stunning watch piece.  Definitely an eye catcher.

Barely holds onto a 14 pro max with a MagSafe case on it.  Barely bumped the phone will fall.  Works a little better with a 14 mini.  The AirPod charger charges very slow even though it gets the AirPods very warm.,0
stay closed,diamond drill organizers. I usually have several projects going at one time.  These boxes are a life saver to me as I can load them - I number the boxes with the color legend and makes it so easy!  They are easy to fill and use with your trays.

At this point  I would purchase these again if I needed more.,1

vacuum head tilts and moves,This Vacuum Sucks!. This is my 3rd Shark cordless vacuum. We have 3 floors in our home and now we have one Shark on each floor. Our lower 2 floors are hard surfaces  but the top floor is still carpeted. We want to get hard surfaces up there  but it will be a large undertaking to do so because of all the staging that has to be done while working. Because of the carpet  we have put this Shark upstairs. Prior to this  we were using a traditional vacuum. It's definitely portable. I love not having to deal with the cord and outlets. It's heavier than the other 2 Shark models we have because of the canister. However  it's still lightweight enough that I can maneuver easily with it. The first time I used it  I hadn't intended to remove the canister  but I ended up doing so. I found it easy enough to vacuum with one hand and carrying the canister in the other. The suction is strong enough to pick up dry cat food that gets left around the upstairs feeding station. (We have an elderly cat that's not very mobile  so we keep him upstairs and he's a bit messy.) It also did a good job of picking up the cat litter that gets displaced from the litter box. The head of the vacuum (not sure if that's the correct term  but I'm referring to the part that moves around w/wheels and does the sucking) tilts and moves as you are vacuuming. This was particularly helpful when vacuuming on the stairs. I tried this on the hardwoods on the main floor. It easily picked up the leaves by the front door that made it into the entry way. I really like the display on the machine that shows you how much battery is left. I was able to do all of the upstairs (4 bedrooms)   the stair case  and the entry way and there was 60% battery life remaining. We are happy to get rid of the old traditional style vacuum. This is a major upgrade for us!,1
bulky,Good brightness levels  battery life is really good. clip a bit weak.. After trying/owning other portable  battery-operated lights & lamps  have to say this is my favorite for its reliable output of light and its sturdiness. Its battery life is pretty good too. The only thing I wish were better is the 'clip'. Depending on the surface its attached to  it does not always hold well. It (clip) is small but also rather bulky and not very strong to give good support to the bulkiness of the light.,0
love this box,Highly recommend. Love this box!,1
flimsy,It does hold the S pen. If the case was just to hold the S pen this case would get 5 stars but in protection for the phone forget that. No shock walls the case is way too flimsy. And make sure you buy the right S pen. You need the pen made the S21 ultra. I wanted to like the case. The case I have used most is the Speck Presidio 2 Grip.,0
I wish the mute and volume were on the cable instead the headset.,Nice value gaming headset.. Pros: Fit will over my ears. Good clean sound. Mic works well and does not pick up background noise.

Cons: Only con so far is I wish the mute and volume were on the cable instead the headset.,0
had trouble getting nice sounds from it,I love this ocarina! So pretty and easy to use. The manual is very helpful!. Love this will practice til I can get Saria's song and Song of Storms at the very least! (Was a little dissapointed that last one wasn't on the music sheet). I am so glad with the sounds I could get from this on my first try though! I had another ocarina but it wasn't a 12 hole it was a 6 hole I believe and I had trouble getting nice sounds from it it felt a lot different from this one! I am truly in love the design is so good and pretty I did find a few spots that weren't very well painted though but overall I am totally in love with my new Ocarina &#603,0

planned vacations around Archaeology's articles,"Ahhhh ... my favorite magazine. I'm not an archaeologist. If I was born redundantly wealthy I think that I might have been one.  Archaeology is my ""stop everything and read it on the day it arrives"" magazine. I've been a subscriber for years. I read EVERY article. As a reader of archaeology and paleontology tomes  this magazine is the adjunct to my selections of books to read. My wife and I have planned vacations around Archaeology's articles.  I've detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites.  During a cross country moving event 7 years ago  I let the subscription expire for lack of new address. Someone from Archaeology  not a telemarketer for sure  called me and said that I had been such a long term customer that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew ... was it something about the magazine quality? The voice on the other end was just so dang disappointed as she pleaded for feedback that it was stunning enough for me to remember 7 years later. The magazine must be read by a small but dedicated subscriber base and I think the magazine staff themselves makes the calls.  My only complaint is that it only prints every 2 months. If archaeology is among your interests  you would entertain your fancies with a subscription.",1
satisfying,Great protein drink  satisfies and is good for you. This is my new favorite mid-afternoon protein drink. I take it with me to work and have a tasty  satisfying treat that is good for me and satisfies my hunger and sweet cravings.

I love that something that tastes so good and gives me the nutrients that my body needs. Highly recommend this for everyone.,1
love them,"Simple but lovely baby milestone markers. These milestone circles are lovely and nicely made. There are a total of six 10 ""wooden place cards"" blocks that include all the months  with the 12th month saying ""my first birthday "" and various achievements (like the first smile). They are double-sided so that month 4 is on the opposite side of month 3.  They are used as milestone markers when taking pictures during a child's 1st Christmas  ages  etc. There are any number of combinations available. In general I love them and they are two-thirds cheaper than [[ASIN:B091XJK27X milestone blocks]].  The current price of $9.99  comes to $.50 cents per milestone or $1 per double-sided place card circle.",1
packs easily,Great portable flosser. This portable flosser works considerably well. I took it with me on a trip to visit my grandkids recently. It packs easily and does the job of getting loose food particles between my teeth. To be honest  I also have a Sonicare flosser that has a much stronger water flow which I do prefer  but this is a lesser expensive way to get the job done and it is a handy size for traveling. So  I will be using this one when I am on the go as a way to maintain my oral health.,1

small birds will not eat the peanuts,MOSTLY PEANUTS. This product is mostly peanuts. The small birds will not eat the peanuts. I have mostly sparrows and I came outside to find the small amounts of seeds  in the mixture  all gone. The peanuts were still in the feeder. Birds did not eat.

fabric is a lightweight chiffon-like fabric with a hint of stretch,"Ring the Alarm!!!. Someone should call the cops because looking this good should be a crime. This jumpsuit is oh-so-glam! I honestly can't believe how great it looks for the price. The fabric is a lightweight chiffon-like fabric with a hint of stretch. As a woman with rippled thighs  I was concerned about the combination of a light color and a thin fabric. No worries!! There's no show-through even though the pants are unlined. If you're a larger cup size  you'll probably need to wear a tube top or bandeau under this for more coverage. I'm not judging if you want to show off your goodies. The belt is long enough to wrap around twice. I did this for extra cinching. The color I chose is more of a sage green than a true mint. Pay close attention to the size chart. I found it to be very accurate. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the X-Large.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

nice fitting,Nice Cotton Boxer Briefs. These have nearly everything I look for in boxer briefs.  They are tagless  comfortable  nice fitting  and look nice.  The only thing that is missing is a fly hole which is a bit annoying  but forgiveable if everything else is good.  And everything else is good.  I have put two through the wash and they look good and given the quality feel of them  I would expect that they will last well.,1
uncomfortable for all day wear,Socks come over knee the strong compression makes them uncomfortable on me for all day wear. I love the color of these compression socks. I ordered the small/medium size even though I should have ordered a large because I take a size 9 to 9.5 shoe. Nevertheless  these fit me perfectly and the large would have been too big. The compression is strong  so I do find these difficult to wear all day.  The only thing I do not like about these socks is that they come up to my lower thighs which requires me to fold them over to get them below my knees.,0

fit runs a bit small,Runs a Bit Small. These are good leggings for all types of workouts. The fabric is very soft and stretchy. There's good tummy control. The waistband may roll down a bit while doing some exercises. The fit runs a bit small. I sized up for comfort.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,0
comfortable,Nice hoodie. It's comfortable and the color is true. Nice hoodie.  It's comfortable and the color is true.  I would have made the strings a different color  other than white.  It makes them stand out too much.,1
pricey,Bit pricey   but my cats love them.. My cats love these. Dont order in summer or when too hot as they will melt. A bit pricey  but my fur babies are worth the treat.,0

arrived in good condition,Jeopardy puzzle book. My 81 year old mom is a huge Jeopardy fan and in this time of quarantine I thought this might be a fun diversion once in a while.  It arrived in good condition  quickly (I have prime) along with other items I had ordered.  The spiral bounding makes it easy to keep the book open where you want it without struggle.,1

LOVE THIS MAGAZINE,LOVE THIS MAGAZINE. What's not to like about this magazine ?!?!?! Easy reading and beautiful pictures.,1
gets in the way,Another bad design.. Forget it! It does nothing like stated. Just gets in the way!,0
easy to apply,Another great product from L'oreal!. I am 63 years old and am currently experiencing really sparse eye brows (this is a relatively recent problem within the last few years). Anyway  I love this Unbelieva-Brow product. It is super easy to apply and it covers everything (including my grays). It helps me fill in my aging 'gaps' in eyebrows. I will never use another brow product (unless of course L'Oreal comes out with something newer or more advanced. Just love this and highly recommend!,1
Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions,I greatly enjoyed Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions. As a huge fan of the inspector Montalbano series and other international detective stories  I greatly enjoyed Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions.  The pacing keeps you on the edge of your seat  and  although some elements require you to seriously suspend credibility  overall this is a highly entertaining romp.  Beautiful Sicily is the real star here   and you’ll find plenty of romance and hijinks with the high-spirited German expat Auntie Poldi  who has a few tricks up her fashionable sleeve  and who has set her sights on hunky police detective Vito Montana  and the tension between the two simmers and sizzles for much of the book.  The daughter of a German police detective  Poldi possesses great instincts and a knack for sleuththing that has her trying to find a killer involved with the mafia.  I can’t wait to read more of her adventures in the second book Fruits of the Lord.,1
loved this,Really much funnier and entertaining than I expected. I was a little leery about chosing this DVD thinking it would be a little too mild to be funny. But I actually found myself laughing at most of the comedians (most of whom I had never seen before). I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of dirty talking  nasty comedians and is looking for an alternative entertainment format. I loved this  will definitely be looking into prior releases to purchase for my collection.,1
Recommend from all my heart!,Excellent journalism for a fair price. Excellent surveys  original articles. The level is amazing for 1$/ issue price. Recommend from all my heart!,1

fun to use,Ronco Pocket Fishermen. Ronco Pocket Fishermen!  Who doesn't remember those commercials.  I purchased one a santa gift and liked it so much  I ordered another for myself!

always used Doterra oils both on my skin and in my bottled water,Non Returnsble SUCKY products save ur $ and buy Doterra or others!. I would give this a zero if I could!  Stained my diffuser. Smells awful. Only one of the three bottles was shrink wrapped so they were probably diluted or tampered with. You CANNOT RETURN these!  Ironic they can sell “flammable liquids”  but they won’t let you return them. Complete scam when they totally suck. Save your money and buy Doterta oils. They are awesome. They smell right and they work well even when you only use a few drops in your diffuser. These oils said not to put them in your skin!  I’ve always used Doterra oils both on my skin and in my bottled water. Smells great and tastes great.  These however  are just flat out lousy!,1
one of my cats chews them,turned out AOK after all. my cats sniffed them but didnt chew them ....  i unfortunately cant eat them to give a good review  LOL  I guess they will play with them  or ill throw them outside maybe the possums will eat them  UPDATE one of my cats chews them but she's young the older cat  chewed on one and a tooth fell out  LOL i sent a pack to my friend who has a LOT of cats and they are happy,0
caring,wife / daughter love it. my review is from there perspective as one of those edgy romantic comedies and I must of missed things they got.  both liked how  Carell was funny but yet caring. the blunders seemed to be honest and could almost happen to anyone.  it wasn't too long or too short (their words). they have lent this thing to all kinds of friends.  Even was one of the women and wine night movies.,1
historical insights,Sugar and spice and everything nice!. Samantha Seneviratne’s “The New Sugar and Spice” takes classic comfort bakes like cinnamon rolls  cookies  breads and cheesecake and reinvents them  using seductive hits of spice in creative and crowd-pleasing ways. In the introduction  the author points out that “the flood of sugar has diluted real flavor  muffled complexity  and concealed true richness ” so her goal was to create delicious  healthier desserts that use spices in a starring role in place of the overwhelming sweetness so prevalent in many desserts.  Chapters are divided by spices (sometimes with complementary pairings)  including peppercorn and chile  cinnamon  nutmeg  clove and cardamom  ginger  and savory herbs and spices. Along the way  Samantha includes stories about her family’s roots and how her Sri Lankan heritage influenced her culinary style  along with fascinating historical insights and storage tips on the various featured spices.  Cinnamon  hazelnut and date buns  ricotta cheesecake with bourbon-raisin jam  orange and honey baklava  orange-clove pull-apart bread  and saffron currant braid were all recipes that instantly called my name. Several years ago  I became hooked on Scandinavian baking and now tend to use cardamom liberally in yeast rolls and sweet breads (even in my morning coffee)  so naturally I was thrilled to see a whole chapter starring my favorite spice!  Measurements are given in both volume and weight (which I appreciate as I find weight measurements to be more reliable). Samantha’s guidance is spot-on there are helpful hints both for new bakers as well as experienced ones to guarantee the best results  particularly for recipes involving yeast. Gorgeous photography by Erin Kunkel highlights various ingredients and finished bakes for maximum (mouth-watering!) impact.  In addition to familiar treats  you’ll find updated versions of international classics such as profiteroles  clafoutis and tarte tatin  Scandinavian bakes like saffron currant braids and cardamom-laced shortbread  Thai banana fritters  Indonesian kue lapis  Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars that are perfect for fall  and other fragrant  delightful baked goods that spiced up my rather predictable baking repertoire. As an experienced home baker  I appreciated the challenge and loved the complexity that the various spices gave to my baked goods and will certainly be baking my way through “The New Sugar and Spice in the near future!  (I received my copy through Blogging for Books),1
"""soulful searing vocals by gospel phenom Chris Willis""","Interesting twists on dance/electronic. I first heard of Parisian DJ David Guetta (a fixture in Ibiza and Paris) on the ""Pioneer: The Album Vol. 3"" while living in Spain (Ibiza CDs are EVERYWHERE) with his fabulous single ""Love Don't Let Me Go."" After a long wait  ""Just A Little More Love"" is being released in North America---it's ABOUT TIME!!!. His album is a pleasing blend of styles and moods  all of it intensely danceable. The main highlight for me was not only Guetta's fantastic mixing  but the soulful  searing vocals by gospel phenom Chris Willis (backing vocalist for Amy Grant  CeCe Winans  Twilla Paris  Garth Brooks  and Dolly Parton among others) that made the album come alive. ""Just A Little More Love"" sounds like a throwback to the heyday of the `80s  with elements of funk and disco scattered throughout the driving beats. The album spawned a number of singles  including Ibiza megahit ""Love Don't Let Me Go."" This North American release features an altered tracklist from the European debut  adding the Just For One Day (Heroes) remix from Guetta's new album F*** Me I'm Famous (named after an Ibiza tradition)  cuts several others (Chris Willis' You  Atomic Food)  and substitutes edits for several (Just a Little More Love Elektro edit  Distortion vocal edit  Just a Little More Love Wally Lopez remix edit). The majority of the thirteen songs are vocal-driven  with the exception of 133 and Lately  both instrumentals. Themes range from the noble: social reform (Can't U Feel The Change)  self-empowerment (It's Alright)  love and desire (the campy Sexy 17  People Come  People Go  Give Me Something  the riveting Love Don't Let Me Go  You Are The Music) and just plain fun (Distortion). This North American release is much more geared for club play with the addition of Just For One Day and the edits/remixes. A danceable feast for the ears and refreshingly original. Remember to check out Guetta's new album F*** Me I'm Famous as well.",1
bottom is made of some kind of plastic,A slipping hazard. The shoe top fabric is nice but the bottom is made of some kind of plastic that reminds me of the wheels on a big wheel.  They are a fall hazard.  I wouldn't even donate them so as not to bring that on anyone else.  I actually threw them out and will be more careful in future orders.,0
pieces are a good size and cut well,Animal Crossing Vibe. This cat island puzzle has an Animal Crossing vibe to it. The image is fun and colorful  plus it has lots of cats! The pieces are a good size and cut well. I didn't notice any puzzle dust. I did not care for the company logo being on the back of every piece. That actually made it a little more difficult to sort because you had to look at both sides to make sure you were putting the right side up. It doesn't come with a poster of the image either. I really appreciate that addition to puzzles. It's a pain to have to hold the box in your hand just so you can see where things go. The full image is on the bottom of the box. The lid has a blown up picture that doesn't show everything. Plus  the brand logo is on both of the images. They really are pushing their logo on us!! They do include a business card size picture of the puzzle but that's really impossible to use because it's so small.,1
well made,Love  love  love this pet stroller!. I absolutely love this stroller! My small dog (poodle mix) fits in here great (around 9 pounds). This was fairly easy to put together (I am usually technically challenged so that says a lot!). It is well made and my dog just loves it! I love that I can also take it with me for use in the car. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a pet stroller.,1
some dirt,"Wonderful Music & A Gritty  Hard Life Story. One of the best things about this movie is the really good music it has  especially the vocals by a singer I never heard of before this movie.  Her name is Marideth Sisco  a homely  white-haired  rotund lady with the voice of an angel.  Hearing her singing in this movie makes it worth watching for that alone.  Other artists also contributed to the movie and they are all good.  I won't repeat the plot  which other reviewers have covered.  The biggest criticism I have seen is that this is an unfair portrayal of rural country people.  Yes and no.  I am sure there are people who are as scary and nasty as these in the country  but they are few and far between.  Just like anywhere  there are good and bad people in the country  just as in the city.  This is an entertainment movie not a documentary.  The biggest problem I have with the movie is that the actress who plays 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) in the movie seems a little too fresh faced and clean for the role.  Given the responsibility she has in the movie  you would expect her to show more signs of fatigue and despair  even at 17.  And some dirt she is always just too clean looking.  She does a good job in the role and perhaps the contrast between her purity and courage and the roughness  cowardliness and cruelty of those around her is one of the main points of the movie.  This is NOT a ""must see"" movie and is a little uncomfortable to watch at times  as some of the characters are pretty rough types.  For example  ""Teardrop""  the brother-in-law of the main character  sniffs cocaine several times during the movie.  Overall I stayed interested in seeing what was going to happen and the ending was somewhat satisfying.  If you don't want to watch the movie  buy the music soundtrack.  4 stars for the movie 5 stars for the soundtrack.",0
too much other great tea,Yummy. Great Tea  I just have too much other great tea to continue with the service,0
Amazon photo and movie processing,Reverted Again to Simple-Minded Movie Editing Software. Someday  someone will invent easy-to-use  intuitive software for movie editing.  This PINNACLE STUDIO 20 PLUS software is NOT that product.  Because I make movies only for products reviewed on Amazon  I lack the time and motivation to overcome the relatively steep learning curve required for using this full-featured software to good effect.  Once again  I have reverted to using the simplistic Microsoft Movie Maker software for compiling slideshows and editing short movies to accompany reviews.  It's plenty good enough for my purposes  especially given how much the Amazon photo and movie processing takes away from my submitted high-quality photo and movie files.,0

play it with Power DVD with no issues,Finally got it. I've been wanting this song in 'hard copy' for awhile so when I saw this CD/DVD combo (and it was my birthday)  I snapped it up. The seller was great. The product came in good shape and in good time all the way from Japan so I'm really happy. I was a little worried about region but I was able to play it with the Power DVD with no issues. The song is one of my favorites from Exile the Second as is the music video so it is nice to have the hard copy for my library.,1

lightly spiced,Good beef jerky  excellent lightly spiced  perfect for snacking. Great not-overly-spicy beef jerky. Perfect size for packing in my lunch bag for a mid afternoon snack. This is definitely one of my favorites. I did deduct a star because even though the flavor was great  I did find this pack a little on the dry side. I am going to order another package before month end and if I find the next package to be better  I will be adding to this review and changing it to a 5 star. My brother and nephew really love this jerky  too  and have been eating it for years  so I know it's got to be good!,1

"""absorbs well""","this is a medium tint- definitely gives sun kissed glow  absorbs well  hydrates  non greasy. Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says  ""medium"" in the product description  which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level  so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle  BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink  with cool undertones. Still  I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in  but it gives me a slight tanned look  ""a sun kissed glow"".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..  This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen  using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays  converts them to heat  then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available  blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great  and it depends on what works best with  your skin.  This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious  skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter  jojoba  oilve oil  and vitamin e. It comes out thin  and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round  and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often  sweating it off  etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized  I feel better about keeping it so simple.  Again  I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the ""medium"" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a ""sun kissed glow"". If that is at all appealing to you  then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool  fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast  at all. If your skin is real oily  then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy  and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.  My skin: mid 40s  leans dry  semi sensitive  non-acne Rosacea (redness  visible veins)  I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year  and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else  it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot  and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck  then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try  and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).  I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new  or think of anything else.",1
measurements and temperatures,Fantastic blend of complete menus  seasonality  and international flavors. My friend and James Beard Award-winning cookbook author Meike Peters recently released her latest cookbook “365: A Year of Everyday Cooking and Baking” and graciously sent a copy to me here in Japan  where I eagerly pored over the gorgeous food photography with its tantalizing  jewel-like salads.  Meike’s cooking is very much guided by the seasonal calendar  and in “365”  you’ll find a year’s worth of complete menus (including salads  soups  pasta  sandwiches  vegetables  seafood  meat and sweets) that make the most of seasonal produce  marrying them with a range of international influences including hearty German fare  Middle Eastern  and Mediterranean flavors and inspirations.  With the falling of the leaves and the arrivals of colder weather and flurries  the recipes featuring bright  sunny citrus are a welcome respite. Dishes like Winter Caprese with Blood Orange  Beet and Mozzarella di Bufala  Spaghetti with Ricotta  Orange and Crispy Sage Chocolate and Orange Pannetone  and Sicilian Orange Salad with Olive Oil  Marjoram  and Flaky Sea Salt are sure to stave off winter colds and chase the winter blahs away with the generous amount of vitamin C.  Others like Potato and apple-stuffed cabbage rolls with Walnut Butter and Gruyere  German beef  beet and potato stew  and Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Shallots and Apple  provide stick-to-your-ribs comfort.  The salads are a particular delight  including the rainbow potato salad with radishes  shallot vinaigrette and poached eggs  beet and apple carpaccio with pomegranate  raw asparagus and peach salad with orange blossom water and pecorino  and rainbow potato and cucumber salad with dill-pistachio pesto that will bring a splash of color (and flavor!) to overcast days.  Seasonal ingredients are given light-handed treatments that allow their individual textures and delicate flavors to shine  like fresh strawberries with saffron-vanilla sugar  watermelon caprese with mozzarella di bufala  basil and mint  and squash pasta with orange  maple and sage.  If you are someone who  like me  can never seem to come up with a complete menu  that’s one of the beauties of 365: You can also use the weekly menu planner to come up with a seasonal balanced meal by combining the various options for a given week.  I was absolutely intrigued by the idea of candied cherry tomatoes slow roasted and tossed with olive oil  confectioner’s sugar  and herbs  they dissolve into a silky confit that is the perfect complement for fresh pasta and tiny basil. Plus the leftover oil and tomatoes make a fantastic dipping oil!  Measurements and temperatures are provided in both US / Imperial and metric.  This has become one of my favorite cookbooks of the last several years highly recommended.,1

smells lemony,Lightweight moisturizer absorbs rapidly leaves skin moderately hydrated smells lemony. Even though this is baby lotion  I got this for me. This moisturizer is lightweight  slightly creamy  absorbs rapidly  and leaves my skin moderately hydrated. Since it is lightweight  it is a perfect summer lotion. To my senses  it has a mild lemony fragrance even though that is not listed in the ingredients. This is made of all plant-based ingredients (see photo). The current price of $16 is competitive but pricey for this 6.7 ounce tube.,1

fragrance is wonderful,Wonderful way to keep your lips soft and smooth!. I love this Nivea blackberry lip care stick. First  the fragrance is wonderful (reminds me of 'flavored' lip glosses I used to use when a teen. Secondly  it keeps my lips soft and smooth. I live in Florida where the sun and beachside winds can sometimes wreak havoc on my skin. My lips are always feeling dry and this Nivea product  in my opinion  is better than any typical Chapstick ones. Nivea has always been part of my daily skin regime and now I can add lipcare as well. Highly recommend!,1

older version,This planner is an older version  be aware that it is for 2019. This is a nice planner  but it is older and will expire at the end of the year.  It is not a good value even if it was for this year and next.  It's basically a notebook with a calendar pages.  I would value it at no more than $12.,0
decent and comfortable flooring,Nice Quality. These interlocking exercise foam mats are a good quality. They do fit together nicely and would offer a decent and comfortable flooring if that was your intended purpose. Mine is not. My son likes to create cosplay costumes. He uses foam pieces like this to create elaborate costumes. He heats them up and while they're warm and pliable  he puts them up against curved surfaces such as large buckets and as they cool down  they retain the shape. These are smaller than the last ones he got from the store  but they are a good size for creating shoulder pads or smaller needed costume parts. These have been working well for his latest creation.,1

"look is ""modern""",Nice clean sound and a comfortable fit.. These actually look pretty good and fit really well.  Pros: Sound is clean and powerful. Fit is tight enough to walk (or slow jog) in if you wanted to but not too tight. The ear pads are comfortable enough that you don't really notice them. Microphone works well with Iphone 6. And Nexus 7. Others I have talked to said I sounded clear. After initial Bluetooth setup/connection they sync up pretty quick. Look is &#34modern&#34. Initially I wasn't that fond of the look but they look better in person than in pictures.  Cons: Bass it a bit light but not real noticeable. They are a bit loud. If turned up high the sound reverberates around you. Lights blink on the side and can be annoyingly bright if it's dark.,0
it is that good,The Commander. I loved this book  I could not stop reading it  I even was late coming back from lunch at work because it is that good. I want more  please.,1
simple coated wire,glove box holder/dispenser. I purchased 2 of these... one for the kitchen and one for the bathroom.  Very simple  coated wire.  No more digging for where I last put the box of gloves.  Tidy and organized.  I like them.  They do come with lightweight mollys and screws - the frame is really light too.  I am hopeful the mollys will help when you add the box of gloves - I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. UPDATE:  This item will hold boxes of 100 gloves - nothing than that.,1
multiple ways to carry,Would buy again. Finally a large bag that holds everything! With my first I got a cute backpack diaper bag which was great but when another baby came along there was NOT room! Looked around a while and found this. Wish they had more designs because I’m not really a polka dot fan but whatever  it definitely gets the job done. Multiple ways to carry and easy for husband to wear too. He’s a big dude and can fit this on easily. So many pockets and love the fold out diaper change part which has saved us in some questionable changing areas.,1
sized up for comfort,Runs a Bit Small. These are good leggings for all types of workouts. The fabric is very soft and stretchy. There's good tummy control. The waistband may roll down a bit while doing some exercises. The fit runs a bit small. I sized up for comfort.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1
possible romance,Very Enjoyable Period Mystery about Female Botany Graduate Studen. In this delightful debut  A Botanist's Guide to Parties and Poisons introduces us to Saffron Everleigh  the only female working in the University College London Biology Department.  She is the assistant to Professor Maxwell  a botanist. He is an old family friend  who assigns Saffron substantive work and mentors her  an unusual experience for many assistants and exceptional for a woman in this position. Five years ago  Saffron's father  also a botanist  died in WWI. The novel opens in the roaring Twenties. The University has recently secured funding for an interdisciplinary South American expedition.  While Professor Maxwell was not included on the team  Saffron is assisting him in preparing the documentation necessary for a research project to be conducted on his behalf. The book opens with a party to celebrate the upcoming six-month expedition. Dr. Henry  a history professor who will lead the expedition and well-known philanderer is there with his long-suffering wife. Saffron chats up various people  with mixed success. She decides to take her leave  feeling rather invisible as the only female scientist at the party and serving on the lowest rung of professional staff. She happens upon Mr. Ashton  a young biologist as she is heading down a hallway to make her farewells. As they chat  the two inadvertently overhear Mrs. Henry having a highly personal conversation with their hostess. When she makes her way to the room where the party has gathered  Saffron finds celebratory speeches underway. She approaches her hosts to thank them just when another round of champagne is being poured.  Very near Saffron  Mrs. Henry takes one sip of champagne and collapses  to be carried away by ambulance in grave condition. Khavari does a lovely job establishing Saffron as a curious and competent investigator  working to point out poison related information to the police investigating Mrs. Henry's apparent poisoning checking out a decent array of suspects pulling in others to help with her dangerous enquiries giving us a nice feel for several years post-war London life and academia throwing in a possible romance and keeping it light enough to be a cozy and accurate enough to be a pleasing historical fiction piece. The clues are there  not too clear cut  the red herrings are decent and the setting is well wrought. This one is a win for me!  I will definitely look for the next Sapphron Everleigh installment  with pleasure.,1
still in one piece,Even the box cat loves these bags!. Happy with this product. Cats love playing in  on  and with these bags. So far  still in one piece. Would buy again.,1
great item for yourself or a gift,Great magazine for adullts and teens. This magazine has articles covering a variety of topics from weather to airplanes and cars. There is something in each magazine that will appeal to both the adults and the teens in your family. The price is right so it's a great item for yourself or a gift.,1
beautiful color,Earrings. Light weight  beautiful color  I love these,1
Recommended,Five well earned stars... I loved book one. Lissy and Luke's story captured my attention and I couldn't stop reading. I didn't think the second book of the series could be much better but.. it was. Matt and Brook's story was just as amazing but different. Matt and Brooklyn were friends for over two years because Brooklyn was afraid of losing her best friend. Matt patiently waited for the woman that he knew was the one. Although the plot read like a typical love story the execution was superb. The writing was complex  honest  factual and complete. I didn't have the urge to slam my kindle against the wall because of grammatical errors  piecemeal writing or undeveloped characters. This book is print worthy and if you're an e-book reader you should understand what that is... I would give up a section of my bookcase to a print copy of this series. I like this author and respect her writing style therefore I will be picking up book three. Recommended but start with Book 1.,1
great addition to my kids stocking,LOVED these! Great Gift Idea!. LOVED these! Great Gift Idea! The package was smaller than I expected  but the caramels were yummy! Great addition to my kids stocking this year!,1
little stand feels like it's going to break easily,Helpful!. I used to live in the midwest. In the winter  it was dark when I went to work and dark when I came home. I was never diagnosed with SAD  but I believe I suffered from it. I live in the south now and it has been better. Though this winter  we've had a lot of grey days. On those days  it's easy to feel lethargic. This light has been helpful! It provides outdoor light  indoors! It's easy to use. The buttons are on the lower front. This comes with the power brick which was nice. A lot of electronic items I've gotten recently don't come with one any more. I have this light set up in my home office. Not only does it help boost my overall mood  but it gives me a bright work space which I like. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the little stand on the back of it. It feels like it's going to break easily. So far it's doing okay  but when you move it to get it positioned  it seems questionable. Other than that  I am enjoying this lamp.,0
colors are vibrant,Great quality wall decals.. Nice wall decals. The images are clear. The colors are vibrant. The sticker itself is thick and not thin. Easy to apply. Very happy with my purchase.  ***This was the large size.,1
I am stuck with junk,HORRIBLE PRODUCT. This arch is a very bad product. Horrible product! It started out ok  but the holes do not match  once you start to connect the seating part.  I could not get it together. So  now I am stuck with a piece of junk that cannot be put together! I called amazon and told them the problem. I was told to take the unit down and repackage it for return the next day. I am 72 years old with heart problems and I had a hard enough time putting the top part together! Told them to pick it up like it was because I could not take the parts down  they refused! Now  I am stuck with junk  and I paid a lot of money for this junk  on a retirement salary. Please read some of the reviews  I wish I had before making the purchase. The holes do not match and I do not know how to make new holes and I should not have to do that! Beware before you buy this product.!,0
didn't botch it,worked great. I am not a plumber  so the chance of me botching this was about 100%. I didn't I would like to thank the academy  and mostly EasyDrain  for helping me renovate my girlfriends 1930's plumbing in her bathroom like a champ.,1
"husband prefers these ""sock"" covers as opposed to the styrofoam cup style",work well. my husband prefers these &#34sock&#34 covers as opposed to the styrofoam cup style.  He thinks they stay on and protect better.  They arrived quickly  despite noting addtional days for arrival and in good condition.,1
love it,Love it. Holds lots of. Love it.  Holds lots of stuff,1
have it fully charged,Awesome little jeep. Awesome little jeep.  It is a nice quality build.  Pretty easy to put together.  Fits a toddler great!  Easy to maneuver  except for those short turns  haha!  It holds up to 50 lbs so it can last a smaller child for years.  I could have ridden in this until I was in 6th grade  but I was a tiny child. Lots of fun and brings lots of excitement to see their very own brightly colored  pink jeep!  Be sure you have it fully charged before giving it to the child  because they will want to ride it all day!,1
not heavy sweetener,"Great For Rehydrating Especially  After Bout Of ""The Runs"". I have been trying to build up my system with minerals in my water  but not too long ago  I had a bout with the runs- the kind that leave you feeling rather exhausted after a day of running to the bathroom.  I noticed that I was feeling very ill and weak the next day or two  then it dawned on me.  I thought I would try this..  WHAT IS THIS LIKE? This stuff is thickened in a bottle which has a twist of raspberry flavoring added.  It is not sweet  just has a raspberry essence.  There is no sweetener  and the dropper has measuring lines on it.  HOW TO USE THIS? I was so run down when I got thinking about it  I remembered- you can easily get dehydrated when having ""the runs"".  I immediately got out this electrolyte mixture and put a small amount of this (like.25) into a very large glass of water.  I drank it down as gradually as I could and then through the day I added more water.  By the end of the morning  I was feeling TONS better.  This really did help me rehydrate and feel better after being wiped out.  THE BOTTOM LINE This is not hard to take  has just a bit of raspberry flavor  but does help me to rehydrate when I really need help.  I experienced relief greatly after having a bout with ""the runs""  I plan to use a little bit now and then to continue to rehydrate this winter.  MY RATING FOUR STARS.  I love that this helped me through a rough patch when I needed hydration.  I am torn between five and four stars for review.  I am VERY glad there is not heavy sweetener in this like so many things have.  I also am kind of unclear on ingredients or this company.  I also experienced good from it so far  so I am leaving it at FOUR STARS  but REALLY IT IS FOUR AND A HALF.",1
'be wary of ordering books or DVD's from them',be very careful...... This is a great magazine - buy it anywhere but from the source. If you do go ahead and get a subscription  be prepared to receive books and 'specials' you haven't ordered as 'previews'.  Of course they offer a preview period  which is usually over by the time you actually get whatever it is they sent you. Also be wary of ordering books or DVD's from them. I ordered a DVD and kept getting unsolicited  books from CI for a year. The material is pretty good  although not particularly healthy - usually high in fat and calories. It's the company and it's sales approach that is aggravating.,0
real bargain,What a great device!. It’s easy to use  it shaves ice quickly and beautifully  and is a real bargain. I shave ice in the morning  put it in my insulated cup  and snack on it all day..,1
air tight containers,Happy. Now buying in bill is much easier to accomplish with these air tight containers,1
solid journeyman's effort,The Street Was Always There ... and so was Eric Andersen. One of the great unsung heroes of the American folk  folk-rock  singer/songwriter scenes of the '60s and '70s.  Eric Andersen never reached the level of popular success he so truly deserved  but he's just kept on plugging along  year after year  decade after decade  album after album  label after label.  The Street Was Always There is a fine example of his later recorded work.  His voice is deeper  and a bit worn around the edges  yet as soulful and beautiful as ever.  This covers collection may not be classic Andersen  but it is a solid journeyman's effort.  Much like Andersen himself.  Three-and-one-half stars from this longtime fan.,1
foldable,Best pet carrier in the market today!. I have always used hard-sided carriers for my cat which tend to be bulky and difficult to store. I really was interested in trying a soft-sided one and I am glad I did! This is light weight and foldable so if you need to store it you can easily. Quality made  it assembles easily and has zippers that move smoothly and do not snag. My cat is eleven pounds and I got the larger size to give her a little more room and it works great for her. I highly recommend this soft sided pet carrier.,1
too small,stainless swivels. Too small for what I needed  but it's ok... comes in a great plastic sorted case.  I will put them into my husband's fishing tackle box.  He'll be thrilled.,0
not being patient,It all worked out. I can not do a product review because I have not received it . I bought this product 3 weeks ago and today I received it  I’m very glad and sorry for not being patient. I would give it a five but it was along time get to me.,0
jewel-like salads,Fantastic blend of complete menus  seasonality  and international flavors. My friend and James Beard Award-winning cookbook author Meike Peters recently released her latest cookbook “365: A Year of Everyday Cooking and Baking” and graciously sent a copy to me here in Japan  where I eagerly pored over the gorgeous food photography with its tantalizing  jewel-like salads.  Meike’s cooking is very much guided by the seasonal calendar  and in “365”  you’ll find a year’s worth of complete menus (including salads  soups  pasta  sandwiches  vegetables  seafood  meat and sweets) that make the most of seasonal produce  marrying them with a range of international influences including hearty German fare  Middle Eastern  and Mediterranean flavors and inspirations.  With the falling of the leaves and the arrivals of colder weather and flurries  the recipes featuring bright  sunny citrus are a welcome respite. Dishes like Winter Caprese with Blood Orange  Beet and Mozzarella di Bufala  Spaghetti with Ricotta  Orange and Crispy Sage Chocolate and Orange Pannetone  and Sicilian Orange Salad with Olive Oil  Marjoram  and Flaky Sea Salt are sure to stave off winter colds and chase the winter blahs away with the generous amount of vitamin C.  Others like Potato and apple-stuffed cabbage rolls with Walnut Butter and Gruyere  German beef  beet and potato stew  and Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Shallots and Apple  provide stick-to-your-ribs comfort.  The salads are a particular delight  including the rainbow potato salad with radishes  shallot vinaigrette and poached eggs  beet and apple carpaccio with pomegranate  raw asparagus and peach salad with orange blossom water and pecorino  and rainbow potato and cucumber salad with dill-pistachio pesto that will bring a splash of color (and flavor!) to overcast days.  Seasonal ingredients are given light-handed treatments that allow their individual textures and delicate flavors to shine  like fresh strawberries with saffron-vanilla sugar  watermelon caprese with mozzarella di bufala  basil and mint  and squash pasta with orange  maple and sage.  If you are someone who  like me  can never seem to come up with a complete menu  that’s one of the beauties of 365: You can also use the weekly menu planner to come up with a seasonal balanced meal by combining the various options for a given week.  I was absolutely intrigued by the idea of candied cherry tomatoes slow roasted and tossed with olive oil  confectioner’s sugar  and herbs  they dissolve into a silky confit that is the perfect complement for fresh pasta and tiny basil. Plus the leftover oil and tomatoes make a fantastic dipping oil!  Measurements and temperatures are provided in both US / Imperial and metric.  This has become one of my favorite cookbooks of the last several years highly recommended.,1
greatest voice,Wonderful. Bernadette Peters is phenomenal all the time and this DVD of her performance is wonderful. She has the greatest voice. I bought a used DVD and am hoping it will play okay.,1
romantic story with the medical one,"Seeing is believing. ""At First Sight"" is based on the true story of a man who was blind for nearly his entire life due to cataracts and retinitis pigmentosa before having his sight temporarily restored. Based on an essay by British neurologist Oliver Sacks (who also penned Awakenings)  the film follows stressed-out New York architect Amy (Mira Sorvino) as she attempts to ""relax"" at a weekend spa retreat. At the reception desk  she frowns at the list of activities and settles on daily massages instead. At her first session  she meets Virgil (Val Kilmer)  a man with a truly magic touch. To her embarrassment  Amy breaks down crying as someone actually takes the time to touch her for the first time in a long time. Virgil  blind since childhood  excels as a massage therapist and enjoys hockey. Sensitive  constantly smiling and outgoing  he doesn't view blindness as a disability. Amy and Virgil begin seeing each other  but his prickly  overprotective sister Jennie keeps reminding her of Virgil's limitations as a blind man.  When Amy returns to New York and finds a doctor that is a pioneer in restoring vision  she urges Virgil to consider having the operation. This is the start of a very honest and painful dialog between Virgil  Jennie  and Amy as a child  Virgil was subjected to every manner of faith healing in an attempt to cure his blindness. The remainder of the film deals with the aftermath of the surgery and the strain that Virgil's newfound sight places on his and Amy's relationship. After being blind for decades  Virgil's brain is unable to cope with the new flood of visual input  and he is only able to ""see"" by touch for the first few days. It's a refreshing twist on Hollywood portrayals of narrators succumbing to blindness and the sentiment of ""Rage  rage against the dying of the light."" Instead  director Irwin Winkler and the gorgeous cinematography by John Seale paint Virgil's world of darkness in terms of touch  sound (the gorgeous rainstorm that allows Virgil to ""see"" Amy puts [[ASIN:B0002XVQNU Daredevil (Director's Cut)]]'s CGI rain effect to shame!!) and smell (Virgil initially describes Amy as smelling like cinnamon  nutmeg and vanilla  to which his sister says it sounds like he's describing a coffeecake). His post-op world is one of blurry  super-saturated colors  sudden movements  and confusion  and similar to Asperger's Syndrome  Virgil has to learn to ""read"" facial expressions and visual cues.  Winkler deftly balances the romantic story with the medical one  although the film feels a touch long and could have benefitted from some editing (I wasn't crazy about Nathan Lane's cameo  although I love him in other films such as [[ASIN:0792833198 The Birdcage]] ). Kilmer handles pre- and post-op Val with tenderness and insight as a blind man  he relies on his other senses like touch and hearing to guide him  but sight proves more treacherous and difficult than living in a familiar world of darkness. Sorvino's Amy was sweet and supportive  although at times she has difficulty understanding why Virgil would choose his old life over his new one.  The beautiful visual metaphors and the love theme ""Love Is Where You Are"" by Diana Krall only add to the tender appeal of ""At First Sight.""",1
Ahava products,Wonderful product! Highly recommend!. I need to begin by saying I absolutely love Ahava products. I found Ahava on a pilgrimage I did to Israel in 2008 and a visit to the site of Masada at the Dead Sea. I picked up a gift package of a few of their products and I was immediately hooked. Every day I use their Mud exfoliator  at night I use their night cream and at least once a week I use one of their Mud Pack facial products. I am 61 years old and am often told I look to be in my low 50s. I was thrilled when I saw this new Ahava Osmoter product. I have been using this daily now for about a week and I will say my skin feels and looks like it is glowing. It goes on like silk  has a nice subtle fragrnace and my skin feels amazing throughout the day (even after I put on makeup and/or sun screen). I know this is pricy and you might be able to do better purchasing elsewhere (if you find it cheaper). You won't find a product line that is better for you than Ahava  feeding your skin richly with Dead Sea minerals and keeping you looking young and vibrant.,1

Sookie is starting to show her age,A quick read  but a disjointed and lightweight plot. Dead and Gone  the ninth installment in Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire series  is both a curse and a blessing. Let's start with the good news first: the blessing is that it's a quick  breezy read (I finished it in a couple of hours). The curse is that the plot is lightweight  many of the characters are throwaway  and the book reaches a new level of graphic violence on par with HBO's [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]] adaptation.  As I've noted in the most recent Southern Vampire novels  Sookie is starting to show her age. She's currently without a love life she's sworn off Bill after discovering his treachery  she broke off her relationship with weretiger Quinn  and Eric seems to want to claim her for her own (finally  we get some more Eric action!).  In Dead and Gone  Sookie is once again called upon to discover the perpetrator of a gruesome crime when one of her shifter acquaintances is found brutally murdered behind Merlotte's. Like the vampires before them  the Weres have also decided to go mainstream  and this may be the reason behind the death. There's also a secondary plot involving Sookie's fairy connections through her great-grandfather Niall  and of a brewing war between rival fairy factions that threatens Sookie and everyone that she loves.  The main problem with Dead and Gone is that little time is given to what is supposed to be a central theme. Sure  Sookie's fairy heritage has been revealed in bits and pieces over several books  but in Dead and Gone  this plays a central role yet little is revealed about Harris's fairy culture other than the fact that Sookie is constantly in danger. Regarding the level of violence  the bodies pile up with little rhyme or reason characters that have been present in several books are handily dispatched for no apparent reason other than to generate  collateral damage. Several pregnant women are murdered. There are also graphic depictions of crucifixion and torture that may be disturbing to some readers.  The narrative is disjointed and contains numerous errors regarding events in earlier books. The biggest flaw is the lack of interest too much time is spent on the initial murder while the real battle is anticlimactic. The numerous red herrings (Octavia discovering a long-lost flame and moving out  former friend Arlene's betrayal that nearly results in Sookie's demise  Quinn's single appearance  Sookie mentioning her nephew Hunter only twice) only serve to fill pages and do nothing to advance the backstory or the action. Dead and Gone isn't a total loss  but it's not an engrossing read either  more of a beach book that's good for summer afternoons. Yes  it reads quickly  but I felt like precious little had actually occurred in 300 pages. I can only hope that the next installment sees a deeper story and more character development.,0
louder than the Mackie,An excellent personal monitor for vocalists - compares favorably to the Mackie SRM150. I purchased this to augment our guitarist/vocalist's vocals as both an enhancer and as a personal monitor. I am going to directly compare this to a [[ASIN:B003552MFI Mackie SRM150 5.25-Inch Compact Active PA System]] and a [[ASIN:B008O0RKVA TC Helicon Mic Mechanic]]  both of which I also own.  The Mackie is close to the same form factor as this  but lacks the vocal and effects features that this incorporates. Since it's in the same price range it's an apples-to-apples comparison. In fact  I want to disagree with reviews that bemoan that this is cheaply made because for the price it has about the same build quality as the Mackie (and the almost identical Behringer personal monitor). The connectors  buttons and switches are about equal among them all.  This is louder than the Mackie  and with the effects and vocal enhancements is  in my opinion  superior. However  if you already own a Mackie (or the Behringer)  I strongly recommend getting the Mic Mechanic instead because the range of tweaking that device allows is vastly superior to the controls on this VoiceSolo.  Instead of me boring you with opinions and details  I recommend that you check out the VoiceSolo FX150 Video Manual that TC Helicon has posted on YouTube. That  more than the reviews here  is what convinced me to takea chance on this as both a personal monitor and vocal enhancer  and I am glad I did because this is worth every penny in my opinion.,1

brightness levels,Good brightness levels  battery life is really good. clip a bit weak.. After trying/owning other portable  battery-operated lights & lamps  have to say this is my favorite for its reliable output of light and its sturdiness. Its battery life is pretty good too. The only thing I wish were better is the 'clip'. Depending on the surface its attached to  it does not always hold well. It (clip) is small but also rather bulky and not very strong to give good support to the bulkiness of the light.,1

useful not just for beginning writers,A consistently excellent resource for writers. I have subscribed to Writer's Digest for decades. It is a consistently valuable resource for writers of both fiction and nonfiction. Rather than resting on its laurels as a leader in the field of writer education  WD is constantly updating its offerings. Its content is useful not just for beginning writers  but provides insights that veteran writers can profit from as well.  A big benefit of subscription is access to substantial resources on the WD website. They offer free articles for every genre imaginable  editor blogs  writing competitions  forums  opportunities to join online critique groups and receive peer reviews  and much more.  One thing WD does not offer subscribers  however  is access to current and past issues on their website  unlike most other magazines do these days. This is quite unfortunate  as it can be very useful to have a PDF of a magazine article one wants to clip and save without having to go to the trouble of scanning it oneself.,1

Feels like a spa treatment going on... don't have to leave it on for 20 minutes... just rub until white and leave for a 1 minute... I don't think there is any harm in leaving on a bit longer.  It's smells good - VERY light  clean fragrance.  I wish I could say it's a &#34miracle&#34 treatment.. but to be honest  I think it just feels good more than effectual.  I'm ok with that.

reveal entire puzzle only filled in one word,"Decent  But Expensive Not Fully Functional on New Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" Tablet. CROSSWORDS by Standalone is a decent crossword puzzle app  but inflexible and expensive.  On my Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet  the working display shows about two-thirds of a weekday NY Times puzzle grid  and I can't find any way to resize the grid to show the whole puzzle at once. (You must swipe down or hit an arrow button to reveal the lower one-third of the grid.)  The Across and Down clues appear alongside the grid in a readable typeface  but the clues are cut off at the right.  (Perhaps this is an 8.9"" Kindle Fire HD issue that the developer will correct fortunately  clicking on a cut-off clue will display the full clue below the grid.)  The puzzle hints--found under the list icon beside the app icon  at the left--don't always work as expected.  For example  ""reveal entire puzzle"" only filled in one word (for the 1-down clue) when I started from the ""hints for 1-down"" screen.  In contrast  ""reveal entire puzzle"" filled in the entire puzzle when I started from a ""press-and-hold-on-clue"" popup.  Worse  the general settings for navigation (e.g.  ""skip filled squares""  ""show mistakes"") don't seem to function at all.  (Perhaps this is another Kindle Fire HD issue for the developer to fix.)  The app allows you to enter multiple letters in a single square  and to look up puzzle info (must-haves for NY Times crossword solvers).  If you are a NY Times crosswords subscriber  the app will automatically download the daily puzzles for you.  The app comes with an assortment of puzzles already installed  and allows you to browse for and download many more puzzles from the Internet.  It also allows you to establish an account and compare your times with other solvers.  However  the FREE [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] app does nearly all of the same things.  (Crosswords Plus does not download your NY Times subscription puzzles automatically  although it makes it easy to download them daily it doesn't come with puzzles loaded  although it points you to free Internet sources and it doesn't have a feature for comparing scores with other solvers.)  In addition  [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]] allows you to resize the grid  offers an alternate clues-only view  includes the usual hints options  and has navigational settings (skipping boxes  etc.) that are fully functional on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet.  Even if this CROSSWORDS app worked perfectly  I would still prefer [[ASIN:B005U6QIMI Crosswords Plus]].  For this reason  and because of the high price and current Kindle Fire HD 8.9"" tablet issues  I rate CROSSWORDS at 3 stars.",0

6 pieces,"Our handles are not round  these work fine.... I think these things would look more form fitting if your handles were round. That may just be my mind playing tricks on me. If our handles were round  I might think these look better on the flat handles. LOL! In any case  they get the job done. But up close  the fabric does not feel premium  it's on the cheap side. But you need to consider what you're spending for 6 pieces. The higher quality stuff is more expensive and does not come with 6 pieces. The term  ""you get what you pay for"" comes to mind. So I'm not going to deduct a star for that. I think this is 5-Stars for the price you're paying.",1

various achievements,"Simple but lovely baby milestone markers. These milestone circles are lovely and nicely made. There are a total of six 10 ""wooden place cards"" blocks that include all the months  with the 12th month saying ""my first birthday "" and various achievements (like the first smile). They are double-sided so that month 4 is on the opposite side of month 3.  They are used as milestone markers when taking pictures during a child's 1st Christmas  ages  etc. There are any number of combinations available. In general I love them and they are two-thirds cheaper than [[ASIN:B091XJK27X milestone blocks]].  The current price of $9.99  comes to $.50 cents per milestone or $1 per double-sided place card circle.",1

"""pro-Hungary""","General Look at the Business of Budapest and Hungary. Edited much like Chicago's ""Crain's Chicago Business "" the ""Budapest Business Journal"" localizes its content to serve the needs of those doing business in Hungary's largest city. Its tone is not light  though it is very readable. An MBA is not required.  Not as in-depth as publications like the ""Wall Street Journal "" it does  however  highlight news necessary to serious Eastern European investors. Major articles on the current tax situation  work force issues  hedge funds and market trends all indicate that BBJ is working hard. The pieces indicate research and investigation  with a committed effort to examine all sides of the questions.  BBJ follows the personalities  movers and shakers  and trends that impact Hungary  with increasing news about the European Union. Commentaries and editorials are pro-Hungary  recognizing the great difficulty the region has  but the potential Hungary has as a leading financial center. As optimistic as the editorial staff is about the continued economic redemption of Hungary  articles lean honestly about the struggles and hurdles ahead.  Features include reviews of restaurants and entertainment  and presumes many readers are not regular visitors to Budapest.  Advertising is geared toward expats with higher incomes  with nicer restaurants  corporate services  and luxury travel filling the ad space.  While a meatier newspaper would be helpful  this is a good start. As the economy expands  so should this newspaper.  Anthony Trendl",1

buying wine,"Wine Reviews  News  and More. Wine Spectator is a good wine magazine that seeks to keep the reader informed about new wine products  wine facts and education  and wine events. This magazine is published 17 times per year  so it is available often enough that most wine lovers will have more than their fill of reading material.  Most of the material in Wine Spectator deals with buying wine  and you can expect to find several rating lists in every issue. The editors of the magazine supply the majority of the wine ratings  so when you read that one wine earned 95 points and another only 80  you need to keep in mind that these ratings are from the perspective of people who have sampled hundreds or even thousands of different wines. And with each rating or analysis  there is often contact information  such as the name of the winery or web page  so that you can learn more and/or inquire on making a purchase.  To help shoppers find the wines in each issue  Wine Spectator includes a detachable card that includes the names of the different featured wines. This is a handy addition  because it eliminates the need to copy down names of wine on paper or attempt to memorize the titles. All you do is check off the wines you like on the card and take it with you to your favorite beverage store for easy reference.  Wine Spectator seems to have an obsession with lists and with outlandish proclamations. It is common to find lists like ""World's 100 Greatest Pinot"" or ""The 50 Finest California Reds"". Consumers are attracted to listings  and that is probably why the magazine gave in and made lists a regular part of most issues. And it is common to find extreme statements like ""This is the best Cabernet Sauvignon on the Planet"" or ""Greatest German White Wine Ever"". The publication does this to attract attention and sell more issues  but it could get annoying to some readers.  In spite of these few annoyances  Wine Spectator is still a good magazine. The writers at Wine Spectator are very good  very convincing  and very persuasive. They really know wine  and it comes through in their articles and recommendations. The editors articulate themselves very well and they know just the right way to describe the different brands and styles. It all adds up to a very informative magazine publication on the world of wine.",1
dual door closer system,touch and hold smooth dual door closer system. Husband purchased these to replace some others that had given up the ghost.

licorice pieces,fresh and soft. These are subtle licorice pieces. There are pieces that are predominately coconut. I like them.  My bag arrived with a distant &#34use by date&#34 and was soft and fresh. For me  I am so happy to read the ingredient list.  No red dye #40 or yellow #5 or 6.  Here is the ingredient list on the bag: Sugar  cane molasses  wheat flour  glucose syrup (contains sulphites)  desiccated coconut  palm oil  beef gelatin  corn starch  glycerol  natural colors (plain caramel  beetroot red  curcumin  paprika). fat reduced cocoa  licorice exctract  natural flavorings (aniseed  lemon  raspberry  vanilla  orange) glazing agent (beeswax) fruit and vegetable juices for coloring. Allergy alert: equipment shared with products that include peanuts  tree nuts  milk  egg  soy and wheat. NOT a health food.  But a delightful treat without harmful dyes still legal in the USA.,1
dynamics,Solid instrument that can help with not only time  but dynamics and listening skills. I received this as a free review sample. Since there are a number of very detailed reviews I am going to stick to how I use it as a drummer.  First  if you are practicing dynamics  this is an excellent tool. Of course it's designed to develop a sense of time  but it produces a beat in the 60 dB range at one meter. For a drummer this is somewhere in the P to PP range  so if you combine time keeping exercises with dynamics  this is an invaluable tool that I suspect most drummers will overlook because it's based on a design that is literally hundreds of years old. Trust me  this is effective. Moreover  since it is not incredibly loud it reinforces listening skills. I used this for a solid week in my practice room before writing this review and can make the claim that if you are a trained drummer this metronome has the potential to improve your dynamics  listening and time.  A nice thing is this is not as delicate as the old style metronomes upon which the design is based. It's not a toy and does need to be treated with care  but I owned a much older instrument that was temperamental and did not like being moved or handled much. This one is more robust.  Bottom line: if you are uncertain if this will be loud enough  download a copy of [[ASIN:B0054KJND6 Decibel-O-Meter Free]] and measure your own instrument's sound pressure level at one meter and determine if this metronome will be loud enough. For some instruments it may not be  but for many like an acoustic piano  guitar  etc. it will be. For folks like me this works for certain exercises like those I mentioned and it is a lot more pleasant than some of the electronic metronomes I have tried.,1

apartment feature,"Sims 2 goes out with a bang. The ""unofficial"" word is that Apartment Life will be the final expansion pack for the Sims 2 line. I don't really know if that's true  but if so Apartment Life closes the series on an up note.  Along with Seasons and Nightlife  Apartment Life is one of my favorite expansions. I really like the apartment feature  it's been long overdue. It's so much easier now to start off a sim newly graduated from University by having them live in an apartment. It's so much easier to get them suitable living quarters.  I am so glad we finally have spiral stairs and playground equipment. They were both very much needed 4+ expansions ago.  The social townies can be kind of annoying in a way  but the reputation feature is nice. One thing I don't like is how the new social greetings will mess up the greetings from locals at the Bon Voyage vacation neighborhoods. It's very rare now for my locals to do their normal greetings  instead they do the new social ones and my vacationing sims have a harder time of meeting the ""learn local greeting"" want without cheating on my part. But it's a minor frustration.  Witches are pretty interesting. I like the neutral spells but some of the evil and good witch spells are kind of blah. Plus  I'm really not into the skin overlays with the evil and good witches. I don't like the green or sparkly skin so I use a mod to stop it. But overall I do like the witches and am glad we have them. They're the only paranormal creature in the Sims 2 line I've had more than a passing interest in.  Apartment Life is a great EP and given the choice I'd gladly buy it again. I think it will keep my creativity & gameplay with Sims 2 going for a very long time.",1
simple-minded movie editing software,Reverted Again to Simple-Minded Movie Editing Software. Someday  someone will invent easy-to-use  intuitive software for movie editing.  This PINNACLE STUDIO 20 PLUS software is NOT that product.  Because I make movies only for products reviewed on Amazon  I lack the time and motivation to overcome the relatively steep learning curve required for using this full-featured software to good effect.  Once again  I have reverted to using the simplistic Microsoft Movie Maker software for compiling slideshows and editing short movies to accompany reviews.  It's plenty good enough for my purposes  especially given how much the Amazon photo and movie processing takes away from my submitted high-quality photo and movie files.,0

easy to assemble,Easy to assemble  Bike rides smooth  display and fan not so good.. It is a little difficult to slide the seat into place but I think it's only because it's new. The display panel is too small and it's difficult to see it due to no back lighting. The fan is absolutely useless. Even when I lean into the fan  it doesn't blow my hair at all.  It's too high on the display and too weak.  The plug for the display is in the front of the bike  making it a trip hazard unless you want to face the wall while working out.  I had to tape mine to the bottom of the bike.  They should have passed the wire through the frame of the bike so that it could plug into the back.  The bike itself rides smoothly and is very quiet.  It would be nice to have the bells and whistles actually work correctly.,1
yummy tea,OMG- purple tea! Color me happy!  Yum yum yummy!!. Found a yummy tea to match my tumbler!  Lol. Seriously this is my favorite fruit/berry tea. First time I’ve tried it. I purchased it as an add on item.  What a truly pleasant surprise.  I questioned whether I would really get 15-30 servings out of it given the size of the bag  but I’m pleased to say that I measured it out with my teaspoon to be 15 servings so by brewing it twice I will get 30 servings.  I brewed mine the full 5 minutes. Obviously as would be expected the second brew is weaker  but I just mix the 2 brews together in the tumbler shown in the pic. I brew 8 ounces of water. I even tried to make a 3rd brew using 6 ounces of water  but the result was dismal.  I suppose you could still add it to the first two brews if you like s weaker version  but my granddaughter and I decided not to. Sophia age 8 is living this tea as much as I am.  She’s new to loose leaf tea and I’ve now created a little tea monster that my daughter Samantha will have to deal with when I leave. Poor Sam!  Seriously folks of you like fruity  aromatic tea then this tea is for you!  While I was measuring the tea out by teaspoon Sophia actually asked me if she could use the tea bits as potpourri in her room!  It smells divine.  I started to tell her that it would be very expensive potpourri  but let’s face it folks there is even more expensive potpourri than what this costs me so yes- you can use it to make your house smell heavenly too!  Drink up you tea lovers drink up!  I’m raising my purple tumbler to you in a friendly tea toast and please reply to me with the names of your favorite teas and tea makers so that my g baby Fi and I can try them too as well as your favorite kettles  cups  and loose leaf tea holders.  FYI:  I read a review on here yesterday stating that ALL teabags are held together using polymers that scientists are now trying to determine if those polymers cause cance etc. something along those lines anyways.  The reviewer stated that yhst was why they had turned to lease leaf only. As a person who lost both of my parents to pancreatic cancer 22 years apart and has been tested and now knows that I carry an inherited dna gene I urge everyone to begin limiting your exposure and therefore your risk to all things known or suspected to cause cancer.

does not like the wallet style phone cases,Great Alternative to Wallet Style Cases. I recently learned that iPhone sizes were pretty standard  at least for 6 7  & 8 models. So I ordered this for my daughter to use with her iPhone 6. It fits perfectly! This is a unique case that allows some storage which is great for people who can't carry a wallet or purse with them. My daughter loves using this to go to the movies or places with her friends. She can slip her debit card or cash in the back and she's good to go. She does not like the wallet style phone cases  so this is a good alternative. There is a piece underneath the straps that can be removed. It's a little difficult to put back in place  but not impossible. The bands stretch so they can accommodate slight thickness such as keys. The Under Armour logo is pretty discreet. It offers adequate phone protection.,0
semisweet and milk chocolate chips,Make showstopping desserts on your countertop with minimal effort!. I’m a fairly recent convert to the slow cooker bandwagon I only purchased my first slow cooker a couple of years ago and started out by baking my way through all the desserts in Michele Scicolone’s excellent “The Mediterranean Slow Cooker ” which introduced me to the joys of making flan  cheesecake  and fruit compote in the slow cooker.  Fast forward several years later and I was looking to expand my slow cooker desserts repertoire  so imagine my delight when I got an e-mail from Lisa Ekus that highlighted “Slow Cooker Desserts” by Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore! Roxanne and Kathy are cookbook authors  food consultants  cooking teachers and food bloggers who have written seven cookbooks and a popular blog  www.pluggedintocooking.com.  As soon as my copy of “Slow Cooker Desserts” arrived  I couldn’t wait to dig in to the many inviting recipes covering not only cakes and cheesecakes  but also bread puddings  fruits  and candy and fondues. The book opens with a good compact guide to slow cookers  bakeware  and ingredients. The layout is uncluttered and straightforward  and each recipe is followed by helpful tips  making it perfect for novice bakers. The gorgeous photography by Jennifer Davick deserves a special mention as well.  The first recipe I tried was the Praline-Pumpkin Cheesecake. I decided to substitute a gingersnap crust for the graham crackers  and it added the perfect touch of spice to complement the spices in the cheesecake filling. Note that you do need to blind bake the gingersnap crust prior to baking in the slow cooker  but this only adds a few minutes to the prep time. Also  perhaps it was the brand of gingersnaps I used  but I would recommend adding a little extra melted butter until the crust comes together – the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter for ½ cup crumbs. One thing I would suggest is to also liberally spray the sides of your springform pan as well – mine is supposedly nonstick  but I followed the recipe (which only specifies to spray the bottom of the pan) and a large portion of my cheesecake edges stuck and broke. I normally do spray the entire pan with Baker’s Joy  but I follow the recipes as written when I am testing for reviews.  The finished cheesecake texture is very fluffy and a bit crumbly  so I did have difficulty cutting it neatly I’m not sure if I may have beat TOO much air into my filling and will beat for less next time. The praline topping (made in the microwave in under three minutes) is destined to become my new secret weapon in the kitchen! This homemade caramel was delicious and deceptively easy and would also make a great addition to ice cream or cakes. All combined (gingersnap crust  spiced pumpkin filling  praline topping)  this is a great fall dessert with minimal effort and also frees up your oven for other baking tasks.  The second recipe I tried was the candied cranberry and crystallized ginger chutney this one called my name because I am a certified fiend when it comes to candied ginger. I had a bag of organic cranberries in the freezer that I was looking to use up  so it worked out perfectly that I already had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry (even the ginger liqueur!). My bag of organic cranberries was slightly smaller than the 16-oz. bag called for in the recipe  so I scaled back on the sugar quite a bit as I was using candied ginger (I used ¾ cup sugar in place of the 1 ¼ in the recipe  and it was plenty sweet for me). It also had the bonus of making my kitchen smell amazing as it cooked! I cooked mine down for a little longer the recipe says that it should be thin  but I like my chutney on the very thick side more like a compote. The recipe calls for between 5 to 7 hours on low and I ended up cooking mine for 3 hours on high due to time. This would be fantastic stirred into yogurt  as an accompaniment to Indian food  or even as a side dish in place of jellied cranberries or cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.  The third recipe was the chocolate cashew clusters. I’d seen slow cooker candy (including nut clusters) pop up in my Facebook feed  but I’d never tried making it before. The recipe uses salted cashews  semisweet and milk chocolate chips  a dark chocolate candy bar  and candy coating to create decadent nut clusters that look like they came from a candy shop. These take about 1 ½ hours on low plus cooling / set time (3 to 5 hours).  Other recipes on my to-make list from “Slow Cooker Desserts” include the cinnamon-calvados applesauce  rice pudding with cherries  and many of the cheesecakes (brownie chunk  German chocolate  ginger-peach  coconut cream) and cakes (cider-glazed apple-walnut cake  Southern sweet potato cake  pineapple butter cake). There is enough variety and possible variations (I need to find a way to make a cookie butter cheesecake!) to keep you happily baking for months to come.

process of shipping was too hard,It wasn't worth it !!. Well it was worth a shot ! But I gotta pass cause as you can see from beginning to end the last photo its not looking good   my plant arrived in bad shape and the driver left the box upside down ( no way to tell which end was up ) after getting it planted I was hoping it would make it 😬but its dieing 😭slowly its going the process of shipping was just to hard for it so I wont be continuing my Subscription 😞 2 leafs left barely hanging on !! I really think the care given to the plant during shipping was crap ! Maybe a brighter box like orange or red with a warning or fragile ! For shippers to take notice idk but the box was just thrown around like all the rest ! The box was dented   you could see it was not handled well ! So try the service if you want but thats my story 🙏🌿🌱🌵🍀🙏,0
cat eye,cat sunglasses. VERY cat eye... somewhat vintage.  They are a little stiff... but if you're wearing them just for fun... Eh.  It's fine.  . FYI...I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info be useful.  Further   I do not receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews... my purchases are VERIFIED and full price.  100% independent purchases.  As are my reviews 100% my own and unbiased in any way. However  remember they are my opinions which may differ from yours.,1
entehno,"Putumayo Presents: Greece - A Musical Odyssey. Putumayo's Greece-A Musical Odyssey was released in 2004 to coincide with the Athens Olympics  and features an ear-opening blend of traditional Greek styles such as rembetika (known as Greek ""blues"" and usually about misfortunes) and entehno from artists such as George Dalaras  Glykeria  Apenanti  Melina Kana  Anastasia Moutsatsou  Kostas Mantzios  and Theodosia Stiga.  The magical bouzouki (a steel-stringed long-necked lute) is featured on every track  along with the santouri (a type of dulcimer). There are Balkan flourishes and even a hint of flamenco on Ragizi Apopse. Many of the songs are melancholy-sounding ballads balanced out by more intense songs such as Pino Pino.  Putumayo has included excellent liner notes as usual  with detailed biographies (with an artist pronunciation guide!)  photos  a Greek music glossary  and even a recipe for Tzatziki  Greek cucumber-yogurt sauce.  I had not been exposed to Greek music before watching My Big Fat Greek Wedding and picking up Greece: A Musical Odyssey  but I fell in love with rembetica and the bittersweet songs  and have since expanded my Greek music collection. If you enjoy spirited folk music (or if you really liked the music from [[ASIN:B00006AAUC My Big Fat Greek Wedding]])  you'd do well to buy Greece: A Musical Odyssey.",1
magnets are not helpful,"very heavy. This bracelet is pretty  but very heavy.  I used a link removal kit I received with a different bracelet as even the ""hers"" version was quite large.  In any case... I can't really say that the magnets are helpful... but I am ""testing.""  This particular bracelet doesn't have super strong magnets at all - if that matters to you.  The crystals are not all the way around the wrist... but almost and they are a pretty touch. There are some ""blanks"" so you can remove the non stone links.  The fastner is sturdy and latches securely. It came in a very lovely gift box with bow  so gift ready if that matters to you. It arrived quickly (we have prime) and in good condition.  I will update if there are any wear or other issues.",0
Thanksgiving,Festive Masks!. For the first year of the pandemic  I primarily wore reusable cloth masks. This fall I started wearing disposable ones. I like to coordinate my masks to my outfits or the seasons. I'm very happy with these Christmas masks. They're individually wrapped. The masks feel a little thicker than some of the other disposable ones I've used. They're soft  too. I like the designs a lot. They have the metal nosebridge piece. The elastic ear straps are secured between layers of the mask rather than attached on the side. They seem very secure. They're also comfortable. I will be wearing these as soon as Thanksgiving is over!,1
tools better integrated,Great for new users  lousy for upgraders. In the past I have used several versions of Magix Music Maker  including version 7  2005  and 10. Each has been a steady progression of improvement and capability  so I was quite eager to see how much new stuff was added when I upgraded from version 10 to version 14. I was surprised not so much by the new capabilities but by how much has been removed.  The overall application is similar to Sony Acid or even Audacity - it is a loop-based music composition and production tool. The main production board allows for up to 96 tracks  which is a generous amount and should be plenty for all but the most complex and lengthy of tracks. There are a large number of production tools that allow for all manner of effects and edits  giving a near limitless supply of tweaks and edits that can be made to a track.  The new interface (as compared to version 10 which is my reference point) is sleek and user friendly  although the learning curve for an application of this type is understandably steep. Most functions are relatively straightforward  but some do require a jaunt through the user manual which is included in PDF form in the installation directory.  There is a generous supply of good-quality loops  though users of previous versions have seen some of these in the past. For a new user  though  there's a lot to choose from.  The VSTi interface is vastly improved and updated  making it not only a lot more user friendly but a lot more stable too. A new synth is included  the Vita. This supposedly take place of the guitar and grand piano synths  though I have not worked enough with it to replicate those sounds. I have monkeyed with it enough to make some interesting sounds  though  and overall I think it's a good synth.  Magix has done a nice job of better integrating their tools  which is a step forward. The only problem there is that sometimes users of previous versions may struggle to find some of the tools they want or need. Such is the case with me  though I found most of what I sought. Most - not all. This is where I noticed something unpleasant.  Music Maker 10 came with a wonderful tool called the Music Editor  which is a waveform editor with some other useful functions. I used this more than Music Maker itself. I was anxious to see how it had changed and when I looked for it I could not find it. What I did find  in the help file  was an occasional reference to it including a menu selection for locating it. The selection did not exist. After digging deeper I found that Magix stripped out the Music Editor and it is available as an upgrade to the Producer Edition - which you can ONLY get through the Magix website. Another $30 and you can have what used to be included.  Also gone are the Copper synth and the Silver synth. I used to use the Copper quite frequently and that one will be missed. I do not understand why it was removed  having been in the application for many iterations.  For a new user  Music Maker 14 packs a lot of goodies into the package and is a great starting point. For upgraders  though  it is a disappointment  with the smell of being a play for additional fees (much like activating the MP3 plug-in). This will be my last Magix purchase  based on the change in packaging and pricing  though I like the program itself. Hopefully Magix will realize that alienating long-standing customers is a poor strategy and will include the missing pieces in the regular edition again.,0
Dave Barbour,A pairing made in heaven.... Long before she became known as a sultry sex kitten with 1950's smash hit Fever  Peggy Lee had practiced her sexier side with Benny Goodman on hits such as Why Don't You Do Right. Lee received her big break in 1941 when Benny Goodman heard her sing his vocalist Helen Forrest was about to leave his band  and he was looking for a replacement. A few days later  Lee recorded Elmer's Tune  the first track on The Complete Recordings 1941-1947. That same year  several more of Lee/Goodman's arrangements went on to be hits  including I Got It Bad and Winter Weather.  The Complete Recordings gathers 38 tracks by Lee and Goodman  despite the fact that Lee married Goodman's guitarist Dave Barbour and took a year off  returning to work on her solo career with Barbour (in 1945  she signed a solo contract with Capitol). 32 of the tracks were recorded between 1941 and 1942 and displayed Peggy Lee's widening range to perfection  from blues (Blues in the Night)  ballads (How Deep is the Ocean?  How Long Has This Been Going On?  When the Roses Bloom Again  Where or When  The Way You Look Tonight)  holiday tunes (Winter Weather)  uptempo numbers (Let's Do It  The Freedom Train)  and everything in between. It's amazing to hear how she matures from that first jittery performance on Elmer's Tune to the confident vocalist she'd become.  The remastering has produced a crisp  clear sound  and the discs are printed to look like the old vinyl labels that Columbia's used with Frank Sinatra reissues. The excellent liner notes are by the incomparable Will Friedwald  who writes for all the Sinatra Columbia / Capitol reissues and releases  and include rare photos and a complete list of original catalog numbers  recording dates  and studio personnel. This is a fabulous investment for fans of Big Band (Goodman in particular) and Peggy Lee  but any fan of the Great American Songbook and music of the 1940s will find much to enjoy here.,1
added it to her iTunes playlist,added to collection. Celine is one of my wife's favorite singers. I purchased this for her for Christmas and added it to her iTunes playlist. She really likes it. in fact two songs were added to her 1/2 marathon training playlist.,1
cardamom-laced shortbread,Sugar and spice and everything nice!. Samantha Seneviratne’s “The New Sugar and Spice” takes classic comfort bakes like cinnamon rolls  cookies  breads and cheesecake and reinvents them  using seductive hits of spice in creative and crowd-pleasing ways. In the introduction  the author points out that “the flood of sugar has diluted real flavor  muffled complexity  and concealed true richness ” so her goal was to create delicious  healthier desserts that use spices in a starring role in place of the overwhelming sweetness so prevalent in many desserts.  Chapters are divided by spices (sometimes with complementary pairings)  including peppercorn and chile  cinnamon  nutmeg  clove and cardamom  ginger  and savory herbs and spices. Along the way  Samantha includes stories about her family’s roots and how her Sri Lankan heritage influenced her culinary style  along with fascinating historical insights and storage tips on the various featured spices.  Cinnamon  hazelnut and date buns  ricotta cheesecake with bourbon-raisin jam  orange and honey baklava  orange-clove pull-apart bread  and saffron currant braid were all recipes that instantly called my name. Several years ago  I became hooked on Scandinavian baking and now tend to use cardamom liberally in yeast rolls and sweet breads (even in my morning coffee)  so naturally I was thrilled to see a whole chapter starring my favorite spice!  Measurements are given in both volume and weight (which I appreciate as I find weight measurements to be more reliable). Samantha’s guidance is spot-on there are helpful hints both for new bakers as well as experienced ones to guarantee the best results  particularly for recipes involving yeast. Gorgeous photography by Erin Kunkel highlights various ingredients and finished bakes for maximum (mouth-watering!) impact.  In addition to familiar treats  you’ll find updated versions of international classics such as profiteroles  clafoutis and tarte tatin  Scandinavian bakes like saffron currant braids and cardamom-laced shortbread  Thai banana fritters  Indonesian kue lapis  Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars that are perfect for fall  and other fragrant  delightful baked goods that spiced up my rather predictable baking repertoire. As an experienced home baker  I appreciated the challenge and loved the complexity that the various spices gave to my baked goods and will certainly be baking my way through “The New Sugar and Spice in the near future!  (I received my copy through Blogging for Books),1
kinda big on the straps,Three Stars. Fits the wellie wish dolls ok. Kinda big on the straps and tight to get on,0
uncomfortable,Nice heel cushions  just be sure you are not too active with your feet.. I have been looking for heel cushions for a while now. I walk every morning (upwards of 5 miles) and my heels typically are sore almost every day. I will say that upon inserting these in my sneakers and then putting them on  my feet felt amazing. I immediately could tell the difference in my gait. I had to deduct one star though because after wearing them and walking for upwards of an hour I felt the cushions had shifted. It became uncomfortable for the remainder of my walk. I was wondering if this was just a lark and used them as well the second day  this time using some packing tape rolled to assist in securing them in place in my sneakers. Although this did seem to solve the movement  I didn't feel I should have to adjust this myself to make them work properly. This are probably great if you don't do heavy duty exercise walking/running in them (think every day work  going to dinner or light shopping). But  doesn't seem to work well if you are very active on your feet.,0
Super magnetic,Super magnetic. Gifted these to my dad and have worked with him in the garage. These hold all of our screws  bolts  washers and even car keys from time to time. They are big enough to fit on large wrists but my mom has a smaller wrist and it works for her too.,1
Speaker phone works handy,large dial corded phone. purchased for use when the power goes out... giant number/buttons... NOT back lit... but super easy to see.  Speaker phone works  handy when you need to keep your hands free.  3 giant boxes for pictures of persons you want to speed dial... I don't use that part... but this phone was designed for an older person I think.  :)  A considerable amount of control options... med  high or very high handset volume... ringer hi/lo or off... and a slide control of the speaker volume...  It has a redial button.  A speaker button.  And a flash button.  It has a red corner on the top left that indicates the ring - so when you have the ring off (and when it is on) that light flashes.  There is a dedicated 911 button that is red. The handset sets in the cradle fairly well at the top... the bottom a bit less... and the bottom is what matters.  If the bottom is off the cradle  the phone registers off the hook. I use it sitting on a corner stand... it does have a hole you could hand on the wall.  It is bright white.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. I hope that the time I took to write this detailed review is helpful to you in some way!,1
comfortable,He said they are comfortable and the sound is good. My son loves these.  He said they are comfortable and the sound is good.,1
solar battery charge,Great solar powered lights at a reasonable price!. For the money these lights are fantastic. I live in a fairly dimly lit community and although crime is minimal I prefer to have some sense of security at night. Being solar powered  I was able to set these up easily myself (without have to call in an electrician). These work great and I have them spaced strategically around the perimeter of my home. They are bright  but not blinding  and the solar battery charge keeps them active all night long. I highly recommend these as an added security feature for your home (at a minimal cost).,1
cost less at Target,Extra worlds are awesome  but would prefer a disc with full content. I had not bought other Sims 3 worlds  so I'd assumed that Sims 3 Dragon Valley was a disc with the full content just like a stuff pack. I was pretty disappointed when I realized I then had to go online to download the world. The only positive was that it cost less for me to buy this at Target  than to go to the Sims 3 online store.  I understand that many gaming companies are switching more to online content. However  I'm old school. I want my stuff that I have paid for on a disc so that I can play it whenever I want. Even when the company shuts their site down. Yes  I know that the content is saved on my computer now. But if I ever wanted to play years from now on a different computer it's going to be difficult to play the Dragon Valley world if EA shuts the Sims 3 site down. I still play Sims 2  SimCity 4  and a bunch of other simulation games. I am glad that I have those games entirely on disc so that I'm not subject to the game makers whims.  So unless EA makes versions of these worlds that are entirely contained on a disc  I'm going to pass on the rest of them.,1
tidy and organized,glove box holder/dispenser. I purchased 2 of these... one for the kitchen and one for the bathroom.  Very simple  coated wire.  No more digging for where I last put the box of gloves.  Tidy and organized.  I like them.  They do come with lightweight mollys and screws - the frame is really light too.  I am hopeful the mollys will help when you add the box of gloves - I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. UPDATE:  This item will hold boxes of 100 gloves - nothing than that.,1
top 50 reviewer,touch and hold smooth dual door closer system. Husband purchased these to replace some others that had given up the ghost.  We live on the oceanfront and the salt takes a toll.  These are nice because you can do it with your foot (when install at the base of the door) just tap it and it stays open  tap again and it releases.  Easy Peasy.  He prefers these and says they are easy to install.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes. Bottom line  I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,1
getting to all the pain at once,All Over. My husband has issues with a rotators cuff. The pain is widespread. I love being able to put large pads in four spots and getting to all the pain at once. He loves it too!,1
gothic romance feel,"If I could give it twenty stars instead of five I would!. I finally got around to reading ""On a Falling Tide"" by the uber-talented Georgia Hill as it had been in my to-read pile for far too long and wow what a book! A haunting and original page-turner  this book had me hooked from start to finish. I love historical fiction and none more so than when it has a touch of the supernatural and a gothic romance feel to it. I have read many time-lapse books that other reviewers have called atmospheric but ""On a Falling Tide"" really takes that word to a whole new level! There is love  loss  and of course as with any great haunting read  plenty of madness  which I assure you as a reader  you will feel too. The characters of Charity  Matt  and Lydia are so well written that they are almost tangible  as is the wonderful fictional town of Beaumouth which is set on the very real and beautiful Jurrasic Coast in England (where I was lucky enough to be born and grow up next to). I just cannot say enough good things about this book and if I could give it twenty stars instead of five on Goodreads I would! I cannot wait to see what else Georgia has up her talented sleeve.",1
easy to wear,"Easy-To-Wear Dress. I love a dress that you can just throw on and look like you spent precious time getting ready. This dress is so easy to wear. It's basically a fancy t-shirt. The fabric is lightweight and has stretch. There's an attached tie belt for cinching and cuffs at the sleeves. The pockets are just a fun bonus. The fabric is not fully opaque in bright light as you might be able to see in my picture. It's not a big deal for me. I found the fit to be true to size. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the medium. I highly recommend this dress.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
shea butter,Moisturizing and cost efficient. I love the cocoa butter and shea butter. I hear the shea butter up and whip it until it softens.,1
leave my hair soft and smooth,Just as good as the named brands at a reduced cost!. I get keratin treatments for my hair probably 3 times a year. As such  I always have to use shampoos and conditioners that are sulfate free. Typically  most of the products I use are expensive  so I was looking for an alternative. I absolutely love this Amazon Brand product. Just as good as using a  more expensive salon brand  this shampoo leaves my hair soft and smooth and because its paraben and sulfate free  I  can keep it that way at much less cost. Kudos Amazon for creating another great generic product which is just as great as the named brand products. Oh  and I love the fragrance of this Argan Oil  too!,1
amazing sound,I love the quality of this. This sounds amazing  and it is a good beginer's tool  but it is huge.  I did not pay enough attention to the dimensions when I bought it.  I have literally no room for this to just stand by to use  so I must put it away after every use along with my stand for it.  I does sound great though--I only wish that it had some kind of sensors in the keys so as to tell how hard you used them...sigh  guess you can't have everything at a reasonable price point.,1
quick and giftable creations using box mixes,"A handy  well-designed collection of both baking classics and new favorites. I have about 50 baking books ranging the gamut from heritage recipes like [[ASIN:1579125883 Heirloom Baking with the Brass Sisters: More than 100 Years of Recipes Discovered from Family Cookbooks  Original Journals  Scraps of Paper  and Grandmother's Kitchen]] to regional baking of Italy  France  Turkey  and Mexico. When I saw the Taste of Home Baking book  I jumped at the chance to review it.  The recipes come in a sturdy three-ring binder with a removable plastic splashguard. I loved the idea of the splashguard  although I would have liked to see a notes section at the back. The inside covers contain a handy list of food equivalents and ingredient substitutions  and the primer on baking basics is illustrated with numerous color photos.  Index:  Cookies Cakes Bars Cupcakes Cheesecakes Pies and tarts Desserts Quick Breads Muffins  Biscuits  and Scones Yeast Breads Yeast Rolls Coffee Cakes and Sweet Rolls Almost Homemade Trimmed-Down Favorites Holiday Classics  Each recipe has a short comment or introduction by its author  along with the author's name and hometown. The recipe ingredients are printed in an easy-to-read bold font  and steps are clearly numbered. There is no nutritional info provided.  You'll find plenty of familiar favorites here  along with some new and intriguing combinations. For years  our family made snowballs  a nut-and-butter cookie with a hidden Hershey's Kiss in the center. I found an instant new favorite in the chocolate macadamia meltaways a similar idea  except that you make chocolate-and-macadamia centers  chill them  then wrap the macadamia butter dough around them and bake.  For those who have always wanted to try working with yeast  but found it intimidating  this is the perfect guide to demystify the process. There are several chapters on yeast breads  yeast rolls  and sweet rolls  and each chapter opens with a sidebar containing helpful hints. There is a whole page of color photos with step-by-step illustrations of kneading  shaping  and baking yeast bread  tips and troubleshooting for baking in bread machines  how to shape bagels  pretzels  cloverleaf rolls  and more.  If you're in a time crunch  the ""Almost Homemade"" chapter uses box mixes with personalized touches to create quick (and giftable) creations. The ""Trimmed Down"" chapter includes low-fat  egg-free  gluten-free and lactose-free recipes. Holiday recipes features kid-friendly favorites  mostly decorated sugar cookies (boneyard cookies  shamrock cookies  shortbread ornament cookies  etc.).  This is a great go-to baking reference that covers all major baking categories with step-by-step guidance and plenty of photos. It would make a great gift for new bakers (or college students)  since most ingredients are easy to find and there are many simplified recipes that require little time and few ingredients. To sweeten the deal  the book also comes with a free one-year subscription to [[ASIN:B004GVZUU4 Taste of Home (1-year auto-renewal)]].",1
Eva Longoria seems a bit out of her league,Better Than Average. There are so many mediocre movies out there that just aren't that good.  I thought this was a cut above that.  Sure it's a bit predictable and it's not exactly non-stop action that takes your breath away  but it has an interesting plot and it moves along well.  The actors all do a good job and are convincing in their roles.  Eva Longoria seems a bit out of her league and her character doesn't develop into that much  but she sure is easy on the eyes.  She's okay  but they could have done a bit more with her character.  It's not a 5-star movie  but there was never a boring moment for me.  Do you want to own it? perhaps not.  Probably better as a one time rental  although it's entertaining enough to watch over again  once in a while.,0

Bundt pan to strip corn kernels with no mess,... I've seen before through Cook's Illustrated hacks and the like (using a Bundt pan to strip corn kernels with .... Some of these I've seen before through Cook's Illustrated hacks and the like (using a Bundt pan to strip corn kernels with no mess)  and some fall on the &#34less practical&#34 side (like using foil as a roasting pan if you're attempting to bake anything remotely heavy / messy  the foil will buckle and spill when you try to pull the whole thing out of the oven unless you're using a cake lifter under it - been there  made that mistake!).  But for those with tiny or underequipped kitchens (including rental houses on vacation)  there are some great lifesavers here that will still enable you to bake  poach  broil  etc.  using repurposed kitchen items (foil  cake pans  etc.)  along with simple recipes that illustrate / use the aforementioned techniques.,1
lots of cats,Animal Crossing Vibe. This cat island puzzle has an Animal Crossing vibe to it. The image is fun and colorful  plus it has lots of cats! The pieces are a good size and cut well. I didn't notice any puzzle dust. I did not care for the company logo being on the back of every piece. That actually made it a little more difficult to sort because you had to look at both sides to make sure you were putting the right side up. It doesn't come with a poster of the image either. I really appreciate that addition to puzzles. It's a pain to have to hold the box in your hand just so you can see where things go. The full image is on the bottom of the box. The lid has a blown up picture that doesn't show everything. Plus  the brand logo is on both of the images. They really are pushing their logo on us!! They do include a business card size picture of the puzzle but that's really impossible to use because it's so small.,1
Built in tester works great,great organizer. lays neatly in a drawer with all the batteries neatly in place.  Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it.  No more loose batteries all over the house.  Great organizer  can easily see when you are running low.

sleeping with the penguin every night,Would make an adorable gift for the child in your life!. What a great little stuffed animal for the little girl in your life. I bought these (Snow Leopard Switch A Rooz as well) for  2 and 5 year old sisters. Hours of fun. The little one never put it down (and I understand is sleeping with the penguin every night). Big hit for a little price. Nice!,1
Canadian pastime hockey,"Another fine example of Canadian humor...that you'll never see in the US. I first read about Bon Cop  Bad Cop while riding the train to Montreal. There was a bilingual featurette on the film in VIA Rail's magazine  and I was instantly intrigued. I'd seen Colm Feore at Stratford four years ago  and I was familiar with Patrick Huard from the Les Boys hockey film franchise. I studied at Laval University in Quebec City for two months  and specialized in Quebec Studies (history  literature  and cinema) as an undergraduate  so I was intrigued to see how the film would balance both the bilingual and bicultural aspects of living in Canada. The issue of Quebec is a contentious one for a number of political  social  and cultural reasons. Bon Cop  Bad Cop attempts to use humor in an attempt to defuse volatile issues between the Two Solitudes (English- and French-speaking Canada).  A series of brutal murders in the Canadian hockey community pairs together two very different cops: Torontonian Martin Ward  (Colm Feore) a by-the-book  prim-and-proper intellectual  and rough-and-tumble David Bouchard  a shoot first  ask later detective from Montreal. Naturally  the two despise each other at first sight  and the rapid-fire bilingual one-liners between Martin and David are fast and furious from the get-go. Some critics panned the film for a seemingly forced  unnatural balance of bilingual script  but as someone who's trilingual  I frequently switch languages when speaking to other bilingual friends nothing unnatural there.  Much of the comedic humor comes from the culture clash between Martin and David  Ontario and Quebec there are numerous in-jokes regarding Canadian law  stereotypes of Quebeckers (diehard smokers  dangerous drivers  womanizers) and Torontonians (cold  boring  workaholics) and nods to popular Canadian culture (Rick Mercer of This Hour has 22 Minutes does a great Don Cherry impression  Uniprix commercial spoof  cameo by Nanette Workman). There are some hilarious scenes involving tortured translation between the Quebec police chief and his Ontarian counterpart as the two (fully bilingual) detectives watch in disbelief. The secondary characters really shine  from a speed-talking coroner to Martin's glamorous  hip sister who's hot for David  as does the bilingual script. The special effects are very well done considering that the film had an $8 million budget.  In the vein of earlier Canadian comedies like [[ASIN:B00006FDCT Strange Brew]]and [[ASIN:B00006IUG0 Men With Brooms]](a curling ""comedy"" from Paul Gross aka Constable Benton Frasier of [[ASIN:B000A0GY0K Due South: Season One (4-DVD Digipack)]])  Bon Cop  Bad Cop is a sendup of that great Canadian pastime  hockey. Of course  beer  curling  beavers  and the fleur de lis make prerequisite appearances  as does marijuana (there is a priceless scene involving a self-destructing marijuana greenhouse that brought to mind the British comedy [[ASIN:B00003CXMY Saving Grace]]). Romantic interest? Check. (You'll never think of ""Vive le Quebec libre!"" quite the same way again...) Action? Car chases? Explosions? Check. The weakest part of the film is the villain  who is never really developed we never know  or care  why he turned psychotic. There is also a gratuitous amount of violence and swearing (nearly all in French) that seemed over-the-top  but it's obvious from the start that this is a film that has no intentions of taking itself seriously.  Looking at these elements separately  Bon Cop  Bad Cop would appear to be another shallow attempt at creating a uniquely ""Canadian"" comedy. But there is an unexpected depth and tenderness in the character development between Martin  David and their respective families (both men are divorced single parents)  and the bilingual dialogue really shines. Huard and Feore give standout performances  and I felt right at home in that strange limbo between Quebec and Ontario from my experiences in both English- and French-speaking Canada.

Glykeria,"Putumayo Presents: Greece - A Musical Odyssey. Putumayo's Greece-A Musical Odyssey was released in 2004 to coincide with the Athens Olympics  and features an ear-opening blend of traditional Greek styles such as rembetika (known as Greek ""blues"" and usually about misfortunes) and entehno from artists such as George Dalaras  Glykeria  Apenanti  Melina Kana  Anastasia Moutsatsou  Kostas Mantzios  and Theodosia Stiga.  The magical bouzouki (a steel-stringed long-necked lute) is featured on every track  along with the santouri (a type of dulcimer). There are Balkan flourishes and even a hint of flamenco on Ragizi Apopse. Many of the songs are melancholy-sounding ballads balanced out by more intense songs such as Pino Pino.  Putumayo has included excellent liner notes as usual  with detailed biographies (with an artist pronunciation guide!)  photos  a Greek music glossary  and even a recipe for Tzatziki  Greek cucumber-yogurt sauce.  I had not been exposed to Greek music before watching My Big Fat Greek Wedding and picking up Greece: A Musical Odyssey  but I fell in love with rembetica and the bittersweet songs  and have since expanded my Greek music collection. If you enjoy spirited folk music (or if you really liked the music from [[ASIN:B00006AAUC My Big Fat Greek Wedding]])  you'd do well to buy Greece: A Musical Odyssey.",1
DVD's,Dead man's Chest. My 8 year old grandson is VERY into pirate movies and is just now getting to see the pirates of the caribbean stories.  He loves them all.  I don't buy DVD's anymore - so much easier to stream from anywhere and I don't have to store the DVD.  In any case  in my opinion it is worth owning the whole list of the Pirates of the Caribbean!,0
no pushing dirt around,Love it! No chemicals needed!. I love my Bissell Steam Mop.  Easy to put together  just fill and use.  I hate string mops. I feel like I'm just smearing the dirt to new places no matter how well I wash out the mop.  To me  it takes a little longer to use this mop than others but I think it's well worth it because it's sanitizing the floor as I mop.  A swiffer would work similar but only for quick clean up.  This is a no chemical  steam clean.  I would let a baby play on my floor after using this  but not after using a string  sponge or a swiffer mop. They just don't clean good enough. If you have a tough spot  just let the steamer sit on it for a few seconds. It'll clean up all of the goo.  I recommend buying extra cleaning cloths so you can just change them out as they get dirty.  No pushing dirt around. Toss the cloths in the washer and you're done.  No putting your hands in dirty water or on disposable cloths filled with chemicals.,1
good case for the price,A good case for the price. A good case for the price. I was nervous that it would not be roomy enough to fit my Sapphire R9 280X GPU  but it did. However  it is not big enough to fit 2 of them in crossfire  so when that day comes  this case will no longer suit my needs. Otherwise  it is everything I need in a case.,1
missing a fly hole,Nice Cotton Boxer Briefs. These have nearly everything I look for in boxer briefs.  They are tagless  comfortable  nice fitting  and look nice.  The only thing that is missing is a fly hole which is a bit annoying  but forgiveable if everything else is good.  And everything else is good.  I have put two through the wash and they look good and given the quality feel of them  I would expect that they will last well.,0
super light duty carabiners,mini carabiners. These are super light duty carabiners... useful in very light weight use. .. A couple of keys... or a clip to clip onto something stronger... Just know they are NOT heavy duty.  You get a bunch of them - 30.  So you'll have a LOT of lightweight  small carabiners!  They are mainly black with a small amount of silver at the clip.,1
flavorful,Good Coffee. Perfect cup of coffee every time  deliciously smooth and flavorful.,1
lightweight,Very nice brush. Very decent bamboo toothbrush. Generally the bristles are too soft for me. This one is medium-soft. So at least it feels like my mouth is clean after brushing. Lightweight  no guilt. Even the packaging is made from recycled material. Great to have multi pack!,1
way too big,Cute shoe  size down. Shoes are off by a size  way too big.,0
soft,"Comfy Dress. This dress is so comfortable that it feels like wearing your favorite t-shirt. It's soft and has a hint of stretch. There are flattering pleats at the waist and it even has pockets. If you're a larger cup size  the top may be slightly sheer. I found the fit to be true to size. I sized down for a more fitted look. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the small.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
customer service is great,This is a great set of pens!. Love these watercolor pens! Great for so many kinds of art projects- using them for bible journaling and they are beautiful!  Customer service is great too!,1
accidentally deleted it,Super cool sharks. I my daughter likes the sharks one time she accidentally deleted it and had to start over if u like sharks please get this game,0
thin fabric is ideal for keeping cool,Women's Bike Jersey  Short Sleeve  Full Zipper  with Pockets  Pink by Turnhier. 3 pockets on the back of the shirt with a reflective clip. The thin fabric is ideal for keeping cool and cooling off when you stop. Comfortable against my skin. Wash and wear. Fit as expected.  If it falls apart after a dozen washes I will report back.,1
first single 25 or 6 to 4,Chicago 18  the first post-Cetera album. Peter Cetera is gone  long gone  off to pursue his solo career.  Did he leave on his own  or was he pushed out the door?  It's never been clearly explained as far as I can tell  but it was obviously not a happy parting of the ways.  This was the band's first LP  post-exit  and the front cover design is that of a snake shedding its skin.  Anything to do with Cetera?  Anyway  things aren't pretty.  Jason Scheff seems lightweight and tentative as Peter's replacement  Robert Lamm appears to have retreated into the shadows  and Bill (Mr. BLOOZE) Champlin over-sings anything and everything that comes his way.  The record's first single  an inexplicable remake of 25 or 6 to 4  bombed and threatened to take the album with it.  Will You Still Love Me?  That one saved the day but pretty much locked the band into its seemingly permanent power ballad phase.  Producer David Foster plays down the group's vaunted horn section and utilizes a lot of outside-the-band songwriters for material.  Like I said  it ain't pretty.  Two-and-one-half horns.  Recommended to diehards and Chicago completists  like yours truly.  This review is centered on the Rhino Flashback reissue.,0
came set up to my amazon account already,Great for kids. Really great quality for price. Nice big screen and the protector is great. It came set up to my amazon account already (I don’t know how they did that). There are a TON of free downloads. Games and shows. Charges fast and battery lasts a while. My daughter was so happy and loves it. Highly recommend,1
thumbsticks,Not bad!. So I got this with the intent to play Super Mario Odyssey. I received this and the official Pro Controller around the same time and  while I much prefer playing with the Pro Controller because of many reasons  I still use this one for other games besides Odyssey.  The feel of this one is a bit on the light side. It's hollow  though I suspect that's for any lack of vibration. The buttons are nice and clicky  more so than the ones on the Pro Controller  and I actually prefer the buttons on this one. However  because of the slightly wider (larger?) size  the shoulder buttons may be slightly more difficult to reach than the Pro Controller. The thumbsticks are longer  which I do not like for platformers and racing games. They may be good for FPS games  but I find there are far more genres of games on the Switch than FPS.  The back buttons are a nice addition  though I hardly ever use them. I've programmed them to duplicate L and R and thought I'd use them more often  but I don't. They work well enough and are positioned so as not to be in the way of accidental presses  but are within reach if necessary.  The texture is a nice matte feel  so no sweaty palms.  Overall  a great controller if you're looking for one on the budget.,0
easy to install,Blink 2. We own many of these... this set is for our daughter.  Convinced a neighbor to purchase as well.  SUPER easy to install and easy to set up on your smart phone.  No monthly fees.  YOU are the monitor.  They aren't perfect  sometimes not super real time  but they work - and they improve the performance regularly.  If you cameras  overall  I haven't found anything better.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
off taste,Works but not a fan of the flavor. I have medication that gives me extreme dry mouth. I am constantly sipping on water To create Moisture in my mouth. I tried this spray as soon as I got it And it seemed to work nicely but it has an off taste. It is a mint flavor Like tooth paste LOL. It leaves a cool what Refreshing feeling in your mouth. I don't use a lot at 1 time because I'm not crazy about the toothpaste flavor But the little I do use seems to work for quite a while. It's something that's small enough to carry in a purse or a pocket.,0
season 1,AIRWOLF season 1. really like this show: watched it when I was younger: I still like it over and over again: I will never get tired of the first three sesons of Airwolf,1
doesn't expand enough to fit around some things,"Helpful Around Home. I'm 5'6""  so I'm not short  but our kitchen cabinets are way out of my reach. I hate having to drag the step stool in just to reach things on the top shelf. This tool is very helpful in those situations. And it's much smaller than the step stool and fits nicely in the pantry. I like that you can rotate the part that grips onto items. I also like that you can extend it at an angel is you want. It works pretty well for most items. I have found that the claw part (for lack of the official term) doesn't expand enough to fit around some things. I was trying to reach the container of salt so I could refill the shaker and it barely fit around that. Other than that  I like it.",0
small unit,Great clear pictures. Last 100 yrs.. Oh  another tech gadget to learn about. I am 63  I learned how to do things on my computer years ago. I cant do anything about tvs  video player hook ups though. When I got this  I thought it would be one of the hard ones because you have to sinc up your iphone with it..ahhh..but actually  if you follow the simple directions it was easy. Yes I did have an issue connecting the two but it was a matter of being patient. I figured it would be difficult to use to print from the phone...boy was I wrong! After you install the hp socket app  you just click on it and your pictures are there. ...helpful hint  it might take a minute or two the first time you sink the two for the pictures to appear on your phone screen...just be patient  it does work. After that they come up very quickly. The unit is nice and small (fits in a shoe box even with cords)  and was packed very well. It comes with 10 picture papers and 1 ink cartridge. The ink is a nice small unit that pops right in! When you have your picture that you are ready to print  you just click on the printer icon that comes up under the picture...one word of caution here... only hit it ONCE!  This is when your patience is a virtue lol. I hit it once  then waited...nothing happened...hit it again..still nothing  hmm then the on light began to flash ( the pic info was coming thru) and the picture began its printing cycle. It prints one color comes out and is sucked back in for another color. It does this 4times  then the picture comes out  drops on the tray and is done! Easy peasy! Until the second picture began to print because remb  I hit the button twice lol because I didnt wait...I didnt know then  but now I do. The second time I printed a picture I hit the print icon and waited..the picture began its cycle. After all this I can honestly say this is the easiest gadget to set up and use! Since it didnt come with much paper  I ordered more. I compared prices on 4 different sites/stores and they were exactly the same as Amazon  34.99 for 80 picture papers and 2 ink cartridges...Im guessing 1 cartridge for every 40 pictures...makes each pic cost 43.73 cents per picture  which is a bit more than printing in stores but I think those machines are harder to use so to me  this is def. worth the money. I just started to check on some features on the app for adding to pictures. There are happy birthday banners you can add to the picture before it prints and a lace one  pumpkins etc. It also has holiday things to add too! I bet there are so many more features in the app to enhance the photos that I will find as I get better using it!  In closing as you might have guessed  I love this machine and find it was the easiest thing to learn about! Get one lol,1
functional buttons at the top,"Fun Top. This is a cute top for spring or summer. The fabric is very lightweight. The sleeves have a slight flutter that is flattering on the arm. There are functional buttons at the top. If you are a larger cup size  there may be gaps between these buttons. You can easily fix it with either a safety pin or a few stitches. I found the fit to be a bit on the small side. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the large.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
handles are not round,"Our handles are not round  these work fine.... I think these things would look more form fitting if your handles were round. That may just be my mind playing tricks on me. If our handles were round  I might think these look better on the flat handles. LOL! In any case  they get the job done. But up close  the fabric does not feel premium  it's on the cheap side. But you need to consider what you're spending for 6 pieces. The higher quality stuff is more expensive and does not come with 6 pieces. The term  ""you get what you pay for"" comes to mind. So I'm not going to deduct a star for that. I think this is 5-Stars for the price you're paying.",0
quit,worked for a while and then quit. Not worth the money  didn't last at all.  Sorry I purchased.,0
charm looks pink,Not the same color as shown. This charm looks pink. The one I received was not pink in any way. I did not like. Returned it.,0
family friendly comedy,Cat Ballou. This is such a great comedy classic.  One of Lee Marvin's best.  And Jane Fonda is under rated.  The music and story are worth the price of admission.  It's a family friendly comedy - worth owning in my personal opinion.,1
loves to cook,I'm sure he will love. I have had a subscription  but I cancelled it because I have too many mags. coming.  However  I found and old on  so I decided to subscribe again.  But this is a gift for my nephew  who loves  to cook.  I'm sure he will love it,1
Barely holds onto a 14 pro max with a MagSafe case on it,Weak Magnet. This charges a phone very quickly but that is about the only positive thing about it.  The magnet is not very strong at all.  Barely holds onto a 14 pro max with a MagSafe case on it.  Barely bumped the phone will fall.  Works a little better with a 14 mini.  The AirPod charger charges very slow even though it gets the AirPods very warm.,0
rat tail combs,hard shell travel case for hair tools. Got this to &#34house&#34 a small roller type stick and flat iron.. a couple of rat tail combs and a small can of hairspray for my Mom's short hair.  It fits nicely under her sink and is easy to grab. It fits the standard length instruments perfectly. It's lined with a soft  fuzzy material - an elastic band on side keeps your tools in place and the other side has a handy mesh flap perfect for combs  etc. I great zipper keeps everything where it needs to be and then... a super handy handle.  I am very  very happy with this purchase as it fit my needs so well.  I will  of course  update my review should new info seem useful.,1
fit snugly,Nice alternative to standard paper masks. I am writing this review during the 2020 pandemic. I had never used one of gaiter face masks before (I had more traditional paper or cloth wrap around the ears ones). I was actually pleasantly surprised how comfortable these are to wear and easy to pull up and down when you are in and out of locations where you need a mask. These are easy to put on  they do fit snugly (which may or may not be a comfort issue for you). They are not very comfortable in a hot environment because these are not cotton based (I live in Florida and they are hot when being worn outside). However  when shopping  these are great. Not sure how resistant they are to the virus  I typically will wear a filter or even a tissue on the inside when I am going into a crowded area for extra protection. These are cute and colorful and definitely a conversation starter.,0
fun,Way too much fun!. This game is totally addicting.  Couple of levels so far were very challenging but somehow very relaxing.... So much fun!,1
lightened several shades,Love  love  love what it has done for my smile!!!. I haven't used Rembrandt in years and now that I have been using it for over 3 weeks I can't understand why I ever switched. I love this Intense Stain Whitening formula  really helps me keep my teeth looking optimal (considering the years of my drinking red wine and tea). I can tell they have lightened several shades since using it and I didn't need to use whitening strips to do it. On top of it  this has a great tartar control formula which helps me with my gums and tooth health. I will never go back to Crest now that I have rediscovered the great benefits and ultimate impact of using Rembrandt.,1
addition to puzzles,Animal Crossing Vibe. This cat island puzzle has an Animal Crossing vibe to it. The image is fun and colorful  plus it has lots of cats! The pieces are a good size and cut well. I didn't notice any puzzle dust. I did not care for the company logo being on the back of every piece. That actually made it a little more difficult to sort because you had to look at both sides to make sure you were putting the right side up. It doesn't come with a poster of the image either. I really appreciate that addition to puzzles. It's a pain to have to hold the box in your hand just so you can see where things go. The full image is on the bottom of the box. The lid has a blown up picture that doesn't show everything. Plus  the brand logo is on both of the images. They really are pushing their logo on us!! They do include a business card size picture of the puzzle but that's really impossible to use because it's so small.,0
dim and small,Fae too dim and small. For a child this might work for tracing but it is not bright enough for the diamond art canvas.  I have since replaced it with one that provided better lighting.,0
delivery,Great delivery. Was game,1
focal length is best for spinning tops,Excellent optics  great for spinning tops. While this product is probably intended for optical use  the 250mm focal length from my trials is the best curvature for spinning tops to quickly and consistently achieve a stable centered vertical state.  It is lightweight at 50 grams and thin 2.5mm thickness at the edge.  The top edge is a bit sharp  and to reduce the chances of it breaking under the stress of a top hitting against the surface  I wrapped the entire back of mine up to that top edge with adhesive vinyl (black electrical tape would work fine too).  A fee fine scratches have appeared on the mirror from lots of use with some heavier tops  but none that impair the spin to any significant degree.  I usually set this on top of my foreverspin base which matches the curvature  and if the tabletop isn't exactly level  I can adjust the mirror position to achieve a centered spin.  Optically very little distortion and bright.  Great product  well made.,1
shampoos that are paraben and sulfate free,Another great Amazon Solimo brand!. I try to get keratin treatments to keep my hair smoother and minimize frizz several times a year. When I do  I have to always use shampoos that are paraben and sulfate free. And  you guess it  the shampoos are usually more expensive than regular shampoos. When I saw this Amazon brand shampoo I wanted to try it. Usually  Solimo products are just as good as named brand varieties. This shampoo did not disappoint! After using this shampoo for almost a month now  several times a week  my hair is smooth and silky and is just as good as shampoos I have spent three times more for. I also love this coconut fragrance  too! Highly recommend this quality shampoo for all hair types  but particularly for those who want their hair shiny  frizz free and smelling great!,1
hedgehog,Ordered a hedgehog  but received a bear with no stuffing. I received the wrong item and it wasn't a stuffed toy at all.  I received a flat item that was supposed to be stuffed.,0

milestone markers,"Simple but lovely baby milestone markers. These milestone circles are lovely and nicely made. There are a total of six 10 ""wooden place cards"" blocks that include all the months  with the 12th month saying ""my first birthday "" and various achievements (like the first smile). They are double-sided so that month 4 is on the opposite side of month 3.  They are used as milestone markers when taking pictures during a child's 1st Christmas  ages  etc. There are any number of combinations available. In general I love them and they are two-thirds cheaper than [[ASIN:B091XJK27X milestone blocks]].  The current price of $9.99  comes to $.50 cents per milestone or $1 per double-sided place card circle.",1

handle with extreme care,Super oily and extremely sharp be careful.. At first I really didn't like how oily they were stacked together. I literally sliced my thumb open on the first one I was trying to take off the pile. I sliced my thumb again as I was trying to wipe the oily residue off before loading the rotary cutter. So use and clean with a lot of care. I was on a time crunch to complete a project and didn't have the time for the accidents my first attempt caused me. 😂  However  as long as you are careful and use cautious care they were a great buy for a little price. I will purchase these again when I finish using all that came in the pack.  I did ask a quilter friend that regularly uses her cuter and wheels why they needed to be so gross with oil. I was told that it has to do with how many come in the stack and to keep them very sharp while being tossed about during the moving  handling  and shipping. I don't know if her answer is the reason or not but it did make sense to me.  Just handle with extreme care always. Do not let young children use a rotary cutter. And don't let teens that can barely cut with scissors use either. (I'm not being funny with the teen part they will hurt themselves.) Take my word for it. I had teens helping with the project. Only responsible people should use these extremely helpful tool! This was the best tool (along with the self healing mat) I was ever gifted!,0
feel,Great pick to for playing. Great pick definitely provide the tone thats needed for a jazz sound love the grip as well as the feel.,1

recipe for bacalaitos,"Just no.... It was .99 which was the only reason I purchased it. As a collector somewhat of kindle cookbooks I am always on the lookout for great cookbooks on sale. This wasn't it. No pictures at all and when you have regional dishes that is a must. I have no clue what a dish I've never heard of should look like. Ingredients missing from the list. The recipe for bacalaitos was missing the cod on the list!!??? Another recipe has no cook time. It said ""broil"" but for how long??!! No editing  misspelled words etc...  I do not recommend wasting money on this book.",0
lid twists closed really well,locite super glue with a brush. I use this to help with fingernail ridge splits.  Works great.  The lid twists closed really well.  The brush bristles are a bit stiff  but it works to spread the the glue fairly evenly.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
basic story and characters were fun,4witches and a warlock. I have really liked reading books by this author and some of the series were great. I will be honest and say this book wasn't one of those. I thought that the basic story and characters were fun but the names of some characters were so silly that it brought the book down .. Spear Boodle Ginger Peace Tavish Mildew ...they just don't work for me.  I also was disappointed with the weakness of how the witches took down the warlock. But as I said the book was still a fun read.,1
simple recipes,... I've seen before through Cook's Illustrated hacks and the like (using a Bundt pan to strip corn kernels with .... Some of these I've seen before through Cook's Illustrated hacks and the like (using a Bundt pan to strip corn kernels with no mess)  and some fall on the &#34less practical&#34 side (like using foil as a roasting pan if you're attempting to bake anything remotely heavy / messy  the foil will buckle and spill when you try to pull the whole thing out of the oven unless you're using a cake lifter under it - been there  made that mistake!).  But for those with tiny or underequipped kitchens (including rental houses on vacation)  there are some great lifesavers here that will still enable you to bake  poach  broil  etc.  using repurposed kitchen items (foil  cake pans  etc.)  along with simple recipes that illustrate / use the aforementioned techniques.,1
slippery under your feet,Bright and vibrant….but slippery. This rug is bright and colorful and gives the porch a pop of color. I had to return it because it is slippery under your feet and doesn’t hold well to the ground,0
great for River Run Rustic Wood Crafts,Cuteness. Love the different size prints  I am a hobby crafter and make various items  signs and home decor. These are great for my River Run Rustic Wood Crafts.,1
curtain,Perfect length and size. Just as described.. Love this! Just the right size for my bathtub and just what I needed to keep the water in but not have my curtain all soggy and sticking to the bottom of the tub  really perfect! I was hesitant to buy at first but after using for a while this is myfavourite shower curtain for my bath tub yet. It'd probably be too much to hope in the future it had some sort of design on it but I really love it :)  * Wish the shower curtain rings were better quality though.,0
can put a lot of succulents,Space savers. These are very nice planters for being plastic. There is the wide opening at the top that arrows as it goes to the bottom . A very big space saver because you can put a lot of succulents in this 1 container Saving a lot of space on your shelves.,1
Beautiful picture,Easy to do crafts.. Beautiful picture!,1
easy to work,Works well  but needs instructions. There were no instructions  The rod doesn't seem to fit anywhere  so I'm not sure where it goes. We loaded the foil and press and seal into the box. Added the zippers and it cuts wonderfully. I like it and would buy another if needed. I never cut these things straight with the box. This is easy to work.,1

nicely made boat shoes,Really nicely made boat shoes!. For the money  these are really nice boat shoes. I love the color and the canvas material and they fit my husband's size 10 feet perfectly. He has several other boat shoes in his wardrobe  but almost all cost twice at what these shoes are currently priced.  Really nice shoes  quality made  reasonably priced. Highly recommend!,1
cardboard,cats  love it. bought  a  year  ago   it  is  cardboard   but  wonderful for  cats  with  or  without claws   they  rest  on  it  jump   etc.  A  great  purchase.  You  will  be  happy,1
stocking stuffer,Such cuties!. I absolutely love these little dolls. To be honest  I gave them to my niece to play with and she wouldn't put them down. After watching her navigate to the website (absolutely incredible for a 4 year old to be this computer literate)  I was sold on this doll. I really would love to own these myself  lol. You can't go wrong with this as a stocking stuffer  add on gift  or a quick little reward for good grades or work. I love them and they will provide hours of fun for your child.,1
offering the stuff packs at $19.99,Only worth it if on sale. Like others said  this stuff pack is the Holiday pack from last year plus 20 more items. There are some lovely items but EA still doesn't seem to realize that they are shooting themselves in the foot by offering the stuff packs at $19.99. Lowering the price here to $14.99 is a bit better but not by much.  The only reason why I bought this stuff pack was because Circuit City had it on sale for $9.99 between November 19-22. If I'd been paying attention over the summer I would have bought Family Fun & Glamour at Circuit City at those prices but I missed the sales. $10-12 I think is a fair price for the amount of stuff in the pack. If EA set the price to that I believe the stuff packs would literally fly off the shelves. Every time one of these new packs come out I will be keeping my eyes on the Circuit City sales flier in the paper and buy from them.,0
not a toy,super fun but be VERY CAREFUL>. this is not a toy.  but it is pretty awesome.  I wouldn't let a kid fly this unless he is carefully supervised.  i'm an adult with experience flying rc planes.  i was not comfortable when I turned it on.  it could really hurt someone.  there are a few quirks that don't get explained but there are enough users out there that help.,0
easy to set up,Useful and easy to set up and clip! Has everything you need for all hair types. I was looking for a hair clipper that was versatile and could be used on adults as well as children during this pandemic. This Toovren set is just perfect. It has loads of attachments to be able to do the job professionally and quickly. Parts are easy to switch out and clean. Fits well in my hand and makes hair cutting a breeze (even when my two young grandsons are squirming on my kitchen stool  lol). Highly recommend if you are in the market for a new hairclipper.,1
good price,a little small  but good price.. it sticks really well and is cute  just wish it stuck out more for my fingers to hold it a little easier.,1
easy to use,Low quality. Easy to use but is a low quality product.,1
Instructions not in English but they are easy to find,Fantastic. This game is amazing for two people. Great for a couple in my scenario. Instructions not in English  but they are easy to find. The seller is quick and it came in great shape.,1
not too tight,Nice clean sound and a comfortable fit.. These actually look pretty good and fit really well.  Pros: Sound is clean and powerful. Fit is tight enough to walk (or slow jog) in if you wanted to but not too tight. The ear pads are comfortable enough that you don't really notice them. Microphone works well with Iphone 6. And Nexus 7. Others I have talked to said I sounded clear. After initial Bluetooth setup/connection they sync up pretty quick. Look is &#34modern&#34. Initially I wasn't that fond of the look but they look better in person than in pictures.  Cons: Bass it a bit light but not real noticeable. They are a bit loud. If turned up high the sound reverberates around you. Lights blink on the side and can be annoyingly bright if it's dark.,1
characters not well developed,Pretty Predictable/Fairly Boring. I chose this from the library because the author wrote &#34Cages&#34  one of my favorites. It was not as well-written  possibly because it was for a younger audience. Kehret did not flavor with details like she usually does  and the characters did not seem very well developed. It kept my attention enough to finish  but not read again.,0
side plug in for toothbrush,plug extender with shelf. This is really great.  I use the shelf for my cup dispenser and my sonic toothbrush.  I have WAY more plug in options than I need... a bunch of plug ins INCLUDING USB ports!  Further  there is a night light.  It points directly at my toilet cubby so it's about perfect.  It plugged right into the wall plug and is VERY stable even without the screw (I put into a GFI  so I couldn't use the center screw).  The only negative I have to report is that the plugins are all toward the front.  I wish there was a side plug in so that the plug head of my toothbrush didn't stick straight out... Eh.  That's a small complaint  I couldn't ding a star for that cause it's kinda a personal thing.  The shelf has little grooves that was SUPER easy to slide the shelf right on.  The unit is bright white (works perfectly in my white bathroom).  To be honest  I didn't think I was gonna love this as much as I do.  Having said all that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
spare pair,Love these shoes and the color. Love these shoes and the color  I bought an extra pair of these  just in case I need a spare pair. Elegant looking the gray. I own two other colors  which makes me own 4 pairs. great price and quality.,1
Fits 100% perfect,I have not tested the shock yet.. Fits 100% perfect. Look original.,1
pretty and of good quality,Beautiful & Good Quality. I just received this nose ring.  It is very pretty and of good quality.  The heart is a nice size and has a little sparkle to it.  I gave only four stars because of the fit.  It'd be nice if it was a tad bit longer.  I wish nose stud makers would offer a variety of lengths for those of us with slightly larger noses who do not wish to bother with altering fishtails.,1
controller works fine,"Decent controller  but the six-button may be more suitable.. For most of the earlier games on the Genesis  this controller works fine. The buttons are nice and large  and three is all you need for many of the platformers. For a majority of the other games  the six-button controller is a bit more useful  but also has a better shape (in my opinion). I find the three-button controller to be a bit goofy in the hands  and I can never find the ""perfect"" position to hold it in between my palms. The six-button one slides into my hands like most other controllers. Still  it's a great controller to own in any retro-game enthusiast's collection.",1
couldn't lay on it for more than 5 minutes,This is horrible. 0 stars if I could give 0. It was hard to fill with air  no matter how much we flopped it around.  We finally used a heavy duty blower to fill it up.  After filling it up  we laid on it and the air started seeping right out.  Couldn't lay on it for more than 5 minutes.  I do not recommend.,0
"""readable""","General Look at the Business of Budapest and Hungary. Edited much like Chicago's ""Crain's Chicago Business "" the ""Budapest Business Journal"" localizes its content to serve the needs of those doing business in Hungary's largest city. Its tone is not light  though it is very readable. An MBA is not required.  Not as in-depth as publications like the ""Wall Street Journal "" it does  however  highlight news necessary to serious Eastern European investors. Major articles on the current tax situation  work force issues  hedge funds and market trends all indicate that BBJ is working hard. The pieces indicate research and investigation  with a committed effort to examine all sides of the questions.  BBJ follows the personalities  movers and shakers  and trends that impact Hungary  with increasing news about the European Union. Commentaries and editorials are pro-Hungary  recognizing the great difficulty the region has  but the potential Hungary has as a leading financial center. As optimistic as the editorial staff is about the continued economic redemption of Hungary  articles lean honestly about the struggles and hurdles ahead.  Features include reviews of restaurants and entertainment  and presumes many readers are not regular visitors to Budapest.  Advertising is geared toward expats with higher incomes  with nicer restaurants  corporate services  and luxury travel filling the ad space.  While a meatier newspaper would be helpful  this is a good start. As the economy expands  so should this newspaper.  Anthony Trendl",1

"""social reform (Can't U Feel The Change)""","Interesting twists on dance/electronic. I first heard of Parisian DJ David Guetta (a fixture in Ibiza and Paris) on the ""Pioneer: The Album Vol. 3"" while living in Spain (Ibiza CDs are EVERYWHERE) with his fabulous single ""Love Don't Let Me Go."" After a long wait  ""Just A Little More Love"" is being released in North America---it's ABOUT TIME!!!. His album is a pleasing blend of styles and moods  all of it intensely danceable. The main highlight for me was not only Guetta's fantastic mixing  but the soulful  searing vocals by gospel phenom Chris Willis (backing vocalist for Amy Grant  CeCe Winans  Twilla Paris  Garth Brooks  and Dolly Parton among others) that made the album come alive. ""Just A Little More Love"" sounds like a throwback to the heyday of the `80s  with elements of funk and disco scattered throughout the driving beats. The album spawned a number of singles  including Ibiza megahit ""Love Don't Let Me Go."" This North American release features an altered tracklist from the European debut  adding the Just For One Day (Heroes) remix from Guetta's new album F*** Me I'm Famous (named after an Ibiza tradition)  cuts several others (Chris Willis' You  Atomic Food)  and substitutes edits for several (Just a Little More Love Elektro edit  Distortion vocal edit  Just a Little More Love Wally Lopez remix edit). The majority of the thirteen songs are vocal-driven  with the exception of 133 and Lately  both instrumentals. Themes range from the noble: social reform (Can't U Feel The Change)  self-empowerment (It's Alright)  love and desire (the campy Sexy 17  People Come  People Go  Give Me Something  the riveting Love Don't Let Me Go  You Are The Music) and just plain fun (Distortion). This North American release is much more geared for club play with the addition of Just For One Day and the edits/remixes. A danceable feast for the ears and refreshingly original. Remember to check out Guetta's new album F*** Me I'm Famous as well.",1
essential oils,Presto great laundry detergent (use so much less) Essential oils too. I was at first sight kind of disappointed I for some reason thought it was going to be larger bottles. I then realized how concentrated Presto was. I was surprised to find out just how small of amount you needed to use. Presto does awesome cleaning getting the stains out. The fact it use essential oils is even better. The smell is great but I'm more of a fresh linen person. I do recommend it price is awesome because you don't use as much.,1
"""vitamin e""","this is a medium tint- definitely gives sun kissed glow  absorbs well  hydrates  non greasy. Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says  ""medium"" in the product description  which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level  so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle  BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink  with cool undertones. Still  I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in  but it gives me a slight tanned look  ""a sun kissed glow"".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..  This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen  using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays  converts them to heat  then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available  blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great  and it depends on what works best with  your skin.  This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious  skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter  jojoba  oilve oil  and vitamin e. It comes out thin  and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round  and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often  sweating it off  etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized  I feel better about keeping it so simple.  Again  I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the ""medium"" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a ""sun kissed glow"". If that is at all appealing to you  then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool  fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast  at all. If your skin is real oily  then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy  and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.  My skin: mid 40s  leans dry  semi sensitive  non-acne Rosacea (redness  visible veins)  I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year  and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else  it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot  and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck  then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try  and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).  I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new  or think of anything else.",1
soft,does not look like a water shoe. purchased these for my husband  for the beach  does not look like a water shoe  nice looking can be worn with anything. It is soft  it would make a excellent house slipper for someone  it said women  but a men with shoe size 81/2 can wear a women size 10. It look unisex  never told my husband it was a women show. I would recommend it highly. Looks expensive and cool.,1
whole fish steamed with lemongrass,A gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!. When I think of Malaysian dishes  it’s the spicy  layered flavors of Norman Musa’s “Amazing Malaysian” that I think of. It opens with street food and snacks  and moves on to seafood  meat  vegetables  rice and noodles  pudding and drinks  and the Malaysian pantry. Gorgeous photos of street scenes in Malaysia pepper the pages  while the gold-embossed cover looks great sitting out on a table or countertop.  You'll find street snack favorites like chicken satay  net pancakes  roti canai  and fried spring rolls  along with Indian lentil patties  grilled fish paste in banana leaf  tofu stuffed with crunchy vegetables  and the gorgeous Kak Besah’s curry puffs. The seafood dishes reminded me of many preparations I had last year while working in Taiwan whole fish steamed with lemongrass  ginger and chilies  squid stir fry  and scrambled eggs with oysters. The meat dishes featured are mostly chicken and beef (no pork unlike Ping’s book)  with lamb curry  beef rendang  and numerous chicken dishes.  One of my new favorite recipes is the Nyonya Vermicelli Noodle Salad  which features rice noodles  tofu beansprouts  and ginger with plenty of lime juice and fresh herbs (if you are vegetarian  leave out the shrimp paste and prawns). I also loved the Malay Vegetable Dhal Curry  pumpkin in turmeric and coconut milk  and eggs in chili sambal (think shakshuka).  Rice and noodle dishes include tomato rice (nasi tomato)  wok-fried flat noodles  curry laksa  chicken rice  herbal rice  and several egg-fried rices in addition to fried noodles. Desserts range from the effortless (fresh mango  honey and coconut  tropical fruit salad) to the more elaborate (pandan custard and sticky rice layered sweet  sticky rice balls  soy panna cotta with passion fruit and crushed chocolate cookies. And you’ll find any number of refreshing drinks  from lemongrass and honey tea and rose syrup drink to pulled sweet tea and iced fresh lime juice.  At the end are several staple condiments  from the ubiquitous chili paste and ginger soy sauce  to sambals (chili  coconut)  sauces  and vegetable pickles.  Norman Musa’s recipes tend to be a bit more advanced but also result in more complex  nuanced flavors. This is a gorgeous introduction to a marvelously diverse cuisine!,1
purchase of the game included access to all of the songs,Fun. My family has enjoyed Just Dance games over the years. This one is a little different because it requires the use of a cell phone. While I'm not crazy about that  it does seem to work well. The song list is pretty good  though as with most of the Just Dance games  I only knew about half of the songs. To access all of the songs  you do have to subscribe to something. Long gone are the days when the purchase of the game included access to all of the songs.,0
solidly-built straight CW keyer,"Built like a Brick - Which is Good. This is a solidly-built straight CW keyer.  I've ""book-learned"" morse code  but keying morse is another thing.  I practice using this with a morse code app that reads and decodes sound signals.  Then I can tell whether I'm keying the letters and numbers correctly  and whether I'm pausing between letters and words correctly at different speeds.  It works fine with either a 9V battery or a 12V DC adapter.  The sound module is definitely analog  with some variation in pitch (""chirp"")  but it's not a problem for practice.  If connected to a radio  you must disconnect the key from the sound module hence it will not be used at all  so the chirp from the sound generation module isn't an issue.  The tension and throw adjustments are a tried-and-true design that work well for light touch activation and release.",1
perfect for diffusers,Just a lovely clean masculine fragrance that smells like a good soap. I use essential oils in my diffusers and this sandalwood essential oil is perfect for that. This is also great for those who make body butters or other lotions.  The fragrance is  clean and masculine and smells like a good soap. I use anywhere from 3 - 5 drops in my diffuser depending on the size of my water reservoir. The resulting aroma is lovely.  The current price of $15.99 for this large 3.38 fluid ounce bottle is reasonable as it comes to less than $5 per ounce.,1
Barely holds onto a 14 pro max with a MagSafe case on it,Weak Magnet. This charges a phone very quickly but that is about the only positive thing about it.  The magnet is not very strong at all.  Barely holds onto a 14 pro max with a MagSafe case on it.  Barely bumped the phone will fall.  Works a little better with a 14 mini.  The AirPod charger charges very slow even though it gets the AirPods very warm.,0
desiccated coconut,fresh and soft. These are subtle licorice pieces. There are pieces that are predominately coconut. I like them.  My bag arrived with a distant &#34use by date&#34 and was soft and fresh. For me  I am so happy to read the ingredient list.  No red dye #40 or yellow #5 or 6.  Here is the ingredient list on the bag: Sugar  cane molasses  wheat flour  glucose syrup (contains sulphites)  desiccated coconut  palm oil  beef gelatin  corn starch  glycerol  natural colors (plain caramel  beetroot red  curcumin  paprika). fat reduced cocoa  licorice exctract  natural flavorings (aniseed  lemon  raspberry  vanilla  orange) glazing agent (beeswax) fruit and vegetable juices for coloring. Allergy alert: equipment shared with products that include peanuts  tree nuts  milk  egg  soy and wheat. NOT a health food.  But a delightful treat without harmful dyes still legal in the USA.,1
flexible handle,Cool!!. This mini fan does a good job of keeping you cool. It has three fan speeds along with misting functionality. You can add ice water to a small compartment to turn the fan into an evaporative cooler. When using this function  it's best to use distilled water. There's a flexible handle that can be used to hang the fan if wanted. You can use it as a night light or as color therapy with or without the fan. There's also a useful timer function. This is a good buy!  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1
fit my husband's size 10 feet perfectly,Really nicely made boat shoes!. For the money  these are really nice boat shoes. I love the color and the canvas material and they fit my husband's size 10 feet perfectly. He has several other boat shoes in his wardrobe  but almost all cost twice at what these shoes are currently priced.  Really nice shoes  quality made  reasonably priced. Highly recommend!,1
not feel different,Nice supplement but on the pricey side. On the plus side  I rarely eat breakfast in the morning and I easily can take one of these with no adverse stomach or heartburn side effects. In reading the ingredients  these appear to be chock full of almost everything my 60 year old body needs to be healthy and feel energetic. I have been taking them now for two weeks and I honestly do not feel different  but I am sure it is too soon to tell. On the negative side (hence the deduction of one star)  this is almost $50 for a little over 3 week supply. I find this extremely pricey and not something that I will continue taking once I have completed the bottle (unless I have a miraculous awakening that I do not feel currently). Thinking that Centrum Silver or One a Day for Women can fill most of this for a far more reasonable price.,0

stripped-down versions,Elvis Presley's final album release during his lifetime. Seeing Baz Luhrmann's ELVIS brought me back to this one.  Specifically  the use of Unchained Melody (worth the price of the album by itself) and Elvis' performance of it at the end of the film.  This collection pairs From Elvis Presley Boulevard (1976) and Moody Blue (1977) on one disc.  With the exception of a handful of live in-concert tracks  it all adds up to an album filled with songs of loneliness  lost love  and regret.  Three of the studio cuts rock  all in a different vein:  For the Heart has a country-rock bounce  Moody Blue displays a mild disco feel bubbling beneath its pop-rock melody  Way Down harks back to his Burning Love '70s singles heyday.  The rest is made up largely of tears-in-my-beer balladry.  Both of the discs combined here come from the 1976 Graceland sessions and feature a ton of overdubs and sweetening via Felton Jarvis  Elvis' personal producer.  How you feel about that is strictly up to you.  The sweetening was done with the full knowledge and approval of Elvis  so there you are.  The stripped-down versions found on the Way Down in the Jungle Room double-disc Legacy release sound stronger to my ears.  Regardless  the Moody Blue LP was in the charts the day Elvis passed  and it has always held a special place in my heart.  A full five stars for sticking to it and giving his all to the very end.  Highly recommended.,1
more expensive than and less nice than similar products from other brands,Cheaply made  loose threads  thin & scratchy. Title says it all  really. It's thin  it's a very loose knit  there are loose threads everywhere... it's on the wider side so it won't stay up over your nose or keep your neck warm  although wearing it as a hood  around your head   or as balakava is ok. It's more expensive than and less nice than similar products from other brands. Washing it did make it a bit softer  but I have no idea how a reputable brand that is so popular can also be so cheap and poorly made.,0
wind cover falls off,Perfect for Run N gun interviews. If you need something small lightweight and easy to use to take care of your audio needs This is it! Small attaches directly into my IPhone and takes up virtually no space in my gear bag. My only fault for this is the wind cover that comes with it falls off and has long since been lost for me. But other than that a fantastic addition to my gear bag. Would definitely recommend,0

comfort,Amazing comfort. Quality built product with excellent comfort. It’s very important for a headset  especially a gaming headset to fit comfortably. The last thing anyone wants is an excellent sounding headset that doesn’t fit comfortablely. The sound is good with these at the cost. Still in the value gaming headset range. Noise canceling is good and mic is on par with most gaming headsets. The biggest pro for me is the comfort. For adult sized heads but might fit younger heads as well. Over all very pleased. Mainly used to play Fortnite and other Xbox games.,1
fit more than your typical SM58 form factor,Excellent deal and fits some interesting mics. First: you do not need to soak them or do anything else other than spread them with your fingers and let them set overnight. They are like memory foam in that respect. I mention this because there are reviews here that recommend that you soak them. Not necessary.  Mine fit more than your typical SM58 form factor. I have one on a Shure 87A  one on a Sennheiser e945 and another on a very odd shaped mic  the Blue enCore 300.  The do what they are supposed to. I use them on mics in my studio to keep things sanitary.  Bottom line: do not freak out it you receive what appears to be black  foam pancakes. They will come to life very easily.,1
pirate movies,Dead man's Chest. My 8 year old grandson is VERY into pirate movies and is just now getting to see the pirates of the caribbean stories.  He loves them all.  I don't buy DVD's anymore - so much easier to stream from anywhere and I don't have to store the DVD.  In any case  in my opinion it is worth owning the whole list of the Pirates of the Caribbean!,1
tasty,Great protein drink  satisfies and is good for you. This is my new favorite mid-afternoon protein drink. I take it with me to work and have a tasty  satisfying treat that is good for me and satisfies my hunger and sweet cravings. When I am not working  I take a bottle of this and pour it in my Ninja along with some fresh blueberries and strawberries and some ice to make the most amazing smoothie. I love that something that tastes so good and gives me the nutrients that my body needs. Highly recommend this for everyone.,1
good size,Light Weight. We love to decorate for Halloween. This skeleton will be a fun addition to our yard display this season. He does require some assembly. It's easy though and just a matter of sliding a piece or two into place. He's very light weight. He has a sturdy rope attached to him for hanging. And since it's light weight  I don't expect any problems with him weighing down a branch or whatever we use to hang him on. He is a good size. He's a short adult size. His arms are easy to pose. I'm not convinced that he's very durable and long lasting  but I feel confident that he should last a few Halloweens.,1
cheesecake,Sugar and spice and everything nice!. Samantha Seneviratne’s “The New Sugar and Spice” takes classic comfort bakes like cinnamon rolls  cookies  breads and cheesecake and reinvents them  using seductive hits of spice in creative and crowd-pleasing ways. In the introduction  the author points out that “the flood of sugar has diluted real flavor  muffled complexity  and concealed true richness ” so her goal was to create delicious  healthier desserts that use spices in a starring role in place of the overwhelming sweetness so prevalent in many desserts.  Chapters are divided by spices (sometimes with complementary pairings)  including peppercorn and chile  cinnamon  nutmeg  clove and cardamom  ginger  and savory herbs and spices. Along the way  Samantha includes stories about her family’s roots and how her Sri Lankan heritage influenced her culinary style  along with fascinating historical insights and storage tips on the various featured spices.  Cinnamon  hazelnut and date buns  ricotta cheesecake with bourbon-raisin jam  orange and honey baklava  orange-clove pull-apart bread  and saffron currant braid were all recipes that instantly called my name. Several years ago  I became hooked on Scandinavian baking and now tend to use cardamom liberally in yeast rolls and sweet breads (even in my morning coffee)  so naturally I was thrilled to see a whole chapter starring my favorite spice!  Measurements are given in both volume and weight (which I appreciate as I find weight measurements to be more reliable). Samantha’s guidance is spot-on there are helpful hints both for new bakers as well as experienced ones to guarantee the best results  particularly for recipes involving yeast. Gorgeous photography by Erin Kunkel highlights various ingredients and finished bakes for maximum (mouth-watering!) impact.  In addition to familiar treats  you’ll find updated versions of international classics such as profiteroles  clafoutis and tarte tatin  Scandinavian bakes like saffron currant braids and cardamom-laced shortbread  Thai banana fritters  Indonesian kue lapis  Puerto Rican-inspired cazuela cookie bars that are perfect for fall  and other fragrant  delightful baked goods that spiced up my rather predictable baking repertoire. As an experienced home baker  I appreciated the challenge and loved the complexity that the various spices gave to my baked goods and will certainly be baking my way through “The New Sugar and Spice in the near future!  (I received my copy through Blogging for Books),1
many pockets,Would buy again. Finally a large bag that holds everything! With my first I got a cute backpack diaper bag which was great but when another baby came along there was NOT room! Looked around a while and found this. Wish they had more designs because I’m not really a polka dot fan but whatever  it definitely gets the job done. Multiple ways to carry and easy for husband to wear too. He’s a big dude and can fit this on easily. So many pockets and love the fold out diaper change part which has saved us in some questionable changing areas.,1

fragrance is light and not overly strong,Softest skin I have had in years!. I have been using Pre de Provence soaps for years now. When I saw this one which includes shea butter  I couldn't wait to try it. After using this exclusively for almost a month  my skin feels  and looks  incredibly soft and smooth. I have terribly dry skin and always use a moisturizer after my shower  but now I have an additional aid to my dry skin in the shower. I love the fragrance  it is light and not overly strong. Pre de Provence makes quality products and I highly recommend them to everyone.,1

Pokémon games,A lovely little piece of nostalgia!. As a kid I remember playing Pokémon Red on my Game Boy and Pokemon Yellow on my Game Boy Color and have so many fond memories of it.  Now  as a 31 year old man  I bought this game with my Switch to try to relive some of those moments and enjoy the nostalgia.  I haven’t played any Pokémon games since Pokemon Yellow so playing this game was a real treat!  This game was really fun! I don’t regret buying it. But having said that it does have some flaws. Firstly: This Pokémon game was ALOT easier than the older Red  Blue and Yellow ones. I was able to collect all 8 badges in 10 hours of playtime  a lot of that time I wasn’t even playing and just left the game on and a lot more of it was spent in the constant cut scenes. It seems like just when I feel like I’m really getting going Sonia  or especially  Hop interfere and want to have long conversations or  for Hop  to duel me. It’s pretty annoying. Not only that but the fights are much easier. I got through every gym and got all 8 badges without losing a single battle. I didn’t even bother looking for more powerful Pokémon because the first 6 I got were fine and able to beat anyone I came across.  Having said that  this game is great for children! It’s not too hard where they’ll get frustrated  but it’s not too easy for children either. Each gym battle (except one) is fought in a huge arena and it feels great to hear the crowd cheering you on. The music is upbeat and really got me in the mood to kick butt. Each badge earned comes with a sense of accomplishment which is great.  All in all I do recommend this game for children or for adults who played the older games and just want some nostalgia.,0
dainty and pretty,Nice bracelet. I got this bracelet on sale for about $11 and it is well worth it so far. Super dainty and pretty  I like the design of it and how easy it is to put on myself. I like it well enough that I'm considering buying the rose gold version at the full price next.,1
contact dermatitis,LOTS OF ALLERGIES AND BEST Essential Oils I Ever Bought.. I bought this set last June and just opened it now. The fact that the oils are SO fresh upon opening nine months later says a lot.  A few things you have to understand:  The negative review about allergy upon skin contact is only ONE case. As someone with a ton of skin sensitivities and contact dermatitis  I also got a tiny bit itchy with mixing the orange  lemongrass and rosemary onto my skin but THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. These are 100% essential oil  NOT mixed with any kind of carrier. If you go to Whole Foods and buy one of the AuraCacia oils  many are mixed with jojoba oil so that they are easier on skin. Yes  they also have a line of 100% essential oils but these are a much better value. These are FULL POTENCY and VOLATILE which means yes  they *can* burn skin and SHOULD NOT be used on or around pets (do research as I know some oils are poisonous to cats). Any full potency oil can be extremely toxic to children if ingested. If you are making a batch of homemade lotion  DIY sanitizers or whatever else  you add like 4-5 drops for every CUP of product. More than that is going to be way too much. That said  this is actually a REALLY great value for this entire set. And non-GMO  Organic?!!! AMAZING.,0
reasonable price,Wonderful  amazing piano  and what a sound!. This piano is the most exciting one I've ever owned. I'm 85 years old and have had 4 pianos in my lifetime an upright when I was ten years old  a baby grand when I was in my thirties  a Baldwin spinet when I was older and downsizing. BUT ... this Donner electric is beyond wonderful. My daughter and I put it together in about 1 hour and I sat down to it and cut loose. Wow. What a tone  especially in the bass range. I was so thrilled I just started to weep. I can't believe this piano plays and sounds so wonderful! I was pianist for my church over 25 years and played the finest instruments  but this Donner just thrills me. I can't believe this company can offer this piano for such a reasonable price and at Prime shipping. It came right to my door less than a week after I bought it. Thank you  thank you  thank you.,1
licorice pieces,fresh and soft. These are subtle licorice pieces. There are pieces that are predominately coconut. I like them.  My bag arrived with a distant &#34use by date&#34 and was soft and fresh. For me  I am so happy to read the ingredient list.  No red dye #40 or yellow #5 or 6.  Here is the ingredient list on the bag: Sugar  cane molasses  wheat flour  glucose syrup (contains sulphites)  desiccated coconut  palm oil  beef gelatin  corn starch  glycerol  natural colors (plain caramel  beetroot red  curcumin  paprika). fat reduced cocoa  licorice exctract  natural flavorings (aniseed  lemon  raspberry  vanilla  orange) glazing agent (beeswax) fruit and vegetable juices for coloring. Allergy alert: equipment shared with products that include peanuts  tree nuts  milk  egg  soy and wheat. NOT a health food.  But a delightful treat without harmful dyes still legal in the USA.,1
posts are stainless steel and nickel free,Two-toned delight!. These two toned faux hammered earrings are delightful. These are turquoise (smooth) and copper colored (hammered). They are hand-painted/handmade. The posts are stainless steel and nickel free. I have sensitive skin and didn’t notice any irritation or redness. While the packaging is simple  I did like that it included a “thank you” label on the box. These earrings are very classy and can be worn everyday. Overall  these are some cute earrings for under $16.,1

family STILL dumps they're dirty dishes in the sink,Family Doesn't Understand.... I got this as every time I do dishes and clean the sink out  I thought it would be easier for my family to see whats up with the dishwasher. I keep it on Dirty until its full then start it and slide to Clean. Well  it works great for me. Only problem is   my family STILL dumps they're dirty dishes in the sink! If it only came with a family training guide....,0
"""NO WHITE cast""","this is a medium tint- definitely gives sun kissed glow  absorbs well  hydrates  non greasy. Oops! I didn't realize when I ordered this that it says  ""medium"" in the product description  which is what I assume is the level of tint as this is a tad dark for my very fair skin. I don't see an option for any other tint level  so this might be it. Medium-- which appears rather dark and warm directly out from bottle  BUT after it is applied it seems to just blend in- albeit just a hint of color-- not opaque like a foundation. I am surprised it blended in as much as it does as my skin is quite fair & pink  with cool undertones. Still  I likely won't use this by itself. It blends in  but it gives me a slight tanned look  ""a sun kissed glow"".  Tells me that with sweat or uneven application I could have trouble with resulting look. My plan is to mix it in with one of my sunscreens that have a greater white cast..  This is a physical (ie mineral) sunscreen  using zinc oxide. Physical Sunscreens work by sitting on top of the skin to deflect and scatter damaging UV rays away from the skin (whereas chemical sunscreens absorb rays  converts them to heat  then releases). They are often referred to as physical blockers. The benefit of using zinc oxide is its strength in protecting your skin against the sun. It is one of the most effective sun protectors available  blocking out both short and long UVA rays and all UVB rays. Either type is great  and it depends on what works best with  your skin.  This product is rated as having a BROAD SPECTRUM sun protection factor of 31 (you want anything over 25). There are some other delicious  skin loving  ingredients contained in this product such as shea butter  jojoba  oilve oil  and vitamin e. It comes out thin  and applies smoothly. It provides a light sheen which you may or may not like. Not greasy. It absorbs well. I really like the multi action sunscreens. While I wear sunscreen all year round  and I have elaborate skin care routines.. I tend to keep it super simple in the summer. I tend to forgo my morning skin care ritual for just sunscreen (I figure I will be reapplying often  sweating it off  etc.. so why waste other skin care goodies when I can find a decent SPF product that will also moisturized my skin). So with this having ingredients that are good for my skin and help keep it moisturized  I feel better about keeping it so simple.  Again  I would like it better if the tint was a better match. That is on me that I didn't notice the ""medium"" in the description. And it also says that it gives skin a ""sun kissed glow"". If that is at all appealing to you  then give this a try. If your skin is anything darker or warmer than cool  fair skin.. then give this a try. There is NO WHITE cast  at all. If your skin is real oily  then this may be too much for you.. not sure. It feels goo on my normal to dry skin seems to absorb. It doesn't feel heavy  and it doesn't feel like... sunscreen. It is light.  My skin: mid 40s  leans dry  semi sensitive  non-acne Rosacea (redness  visible veins)  I avoid sun-- I always use SPF all year  and often wear a hat or visor. My favorite skin care is sunscreen. If I use nothing else  it is sunscreen that I keep in my routine. I go through a lot  and try a lot.. if I don't like it for my face & neck  then it gets used on rest of body. This is a new brand for me to try  and so far I like it (even though I have to tone it down by adding it to  one of my more white cast sunscreens.. OR go for the sun kissed glow).  I hope this helped . I will be back to update if I learn anything new  or think of anything else.",1
way overpriced,Nice exfoliator - overpriced for my needs. This is a gentle exfoliator. Rating it 4 stars mainly because I didn't care for the aroma (somewhat strong) and I think it is way over priced. I am 60 years old and do not have crepe issues  but I do have aging skin and sagging issues. I have used this for two weeks now. I will state that my skin is a lot smoother than it was before I used it and it does appear to be more hydrated (considering I am in Florida  that is a strong plus). However  for the money  I could buy Ahave products for exfoliating and get the same or better results (and much less a cost). As I do not have major creping issues  I cannot say whether this products works (which may justify the cost)  but for my needs it is an excellent exfoliator and I know I could do better price wise for same,0
larger size bottle of thyme,Great fresh quality spice!. This is a nice larger size bottle of thyme. I use thyme for a lot of my cooking (soups  stews  gravies) so I  wanted a large size. I had never heard of Cerez Pazari before so I was pleasantly surprised. This thyme is a nice full size  smells and tastes super fresh. I am buying other CP products because I was so pleased with this one. I love the large size too. Highly recommend for every chef and kitchen.,1

perfect summer lotion,Lightweight moisturizer absorbs rapidly leaves skin moderately hydrated smells lemony. Even though this is baby lotion  I got this for me. This moisturizer is lightweight  slightly creamy  absorbs rapidly  and leaves my skin moderately hydrated. Since it is lightweight  it is a perfect summer lotion. To my senses  it has a mild lemony fragrance even though that is not listed in the ingredients. This is made of all plant-based ingredients (see photo). The current price of $16 is competitive but pricey for this 6.7 ounce tube.,1

magnets are not super strong,"very heavy. This bracelet is pretty  but very heavy.  I used a link removal kit I received with a different bracelet as even the ""hers"" version was quite large.  In any case... I can't really say that the magnets are helpful... but I am ""testing.""  This particular bracelet doesn't have super strong magnets at all - if that matters to you.  The crystals are not all the way around the wrist... but almost and they are a pretty touch. There are some ""blanks"" so you can remove the non stone links.  The fastner is sturdy and latches securely. It came in a very lovely gift box with bow  so gift ready if that matters to you. It arrived quickly (we have prime) and in good condition.  I will update if there are any wear or other issues.",0
For the Heart,Elvis Presley's final album release during his lifetime. Seeing Baz Luhrmann's ELVIS brought me back to this one.  Specifically  the use of Unchained Melody (worth the price of the album by itself) and Elvis' performance of it at the end of the film.  This collection pairs From Elvis Presley Boulevard (1976) and Moody Blue (1977) on one disc.  With the exception of a handful of live in-concert tracks  it all adds up to an album filled with songs of loneliness  lost love  and regret.  Three of the studio cuts rock  all in a different vein:  For the Heart has a country-rock bounce  Moody Blue displays a mild disco feel bubbling beneath its pop-rock melody  Way Down harks back to his Burning Love '70s singles heyday.  The rest is made up largely of tears-in-my-beer balladry.  Both of the discs combined here come from the 1976 Graceland sessions and feature a ton of overdubs and sweetening via Felton Jarvis  Elvis' personal producer.  How you feel about that is strictly up to you.  The sweetening was done with the full knowledge and approval of Elvis  so there you are.  The stripped-down versions found on the Way Down in the Jungle Room double-disc Legacy release sound stronger to my ears.  Regardless  the Moody Blue LP was in the charts the day Elvis passed  and it has always held a special place in my heart.  A full five stars for sticking to it and giving his all to the very end.  Highly recommended.,1
knuckles hardened but not high quality material,Not small enough for me.... Sadly  I have super tiny hands  and that makes it incredibly difficult to find proper motorcycle gloves that fit and offer good protection. I got a pair of XS gloves and they were still too big. However  they are the closest I've come to fitting me properly from any gloves I've gotten  so I will give a star for that. The palms are fine  but the fingertips are way too long.  Sizing apart  the quality of the gloves are no better than you'd expect from cheap gloves. Sadly due to the sizing issue  it's hard to find the right size in any quality so I try to make due with what I can get. The knuckles are hardened  but not with that hard rubberized material other high quality gloves have. The rest of the glove is rather thin but flexible. While it's nice to have that extra mobility  I wouldn't trust these in a high speed fall. These would fall apart. For driving around town  these should be more than enough. And with the touch phone fingertips  it can be pretty convenient when quickly checking something on your phone.  These are the gloves I'm using now  and so far with light use  they have been holding up just fine. I'll update if anything comes up over time.,0
haven't used it much,Good. Seems to work well - haven’t used it much,0
offers adequate phone protection,Great Alternative to Wallet Style Cases. I recently learned that iPhone sizes were pretty standard  at least for 6 7  & 8 models. So I ordered this for my daughter to use with her iPhone 6. It fits perfectly! This is a unique case that allows some storage which is great for people who can't carry a wallet or purse with them. My daughter loves using this to go to the movies or places with her friends. She can slip her debit card or cash in the back and she's good to go. She does not like the wallet style phone cases  so this is a good alternative. There is a piece underneath the straps that can be removed. It's a little difficult to put back in place  but not impossible. The bands stretch so they can accommodate slight thickness such as keys. The Under Armour logo is pretty discreet. It offers adequate phone protection.,1
leaves you thinking,real or memorex. You think you know what you're watching is real but are you sure. I felt engaged all the way through. a few times I thought I was figuring it all out. but as this started coming to a conclusion... not so much. the end leaves you thinking I like that...  when you watch it again you know what's coming but I picked up on things I missed earlier. it helped but I still felt in the end a bit off  not sure if it was real or ....  it will be interesting to wait a few years and watch this again and see how it seems. we don't do movie channels  hbo  showtime etc  we pull out our videos and watch them instead.,1
size chart is very accurate,"Ring the Alarm!!!. Someone should call the cops because looking this good should be a crime. This jumpsuit is oh-so-glam! I honestly can't believe how great it looks for the price. The fabric is a lightweight chiffon-like fabric with a hint of stretch. As a woman with rippled thighs  I was concerned about the combination of a light color and a thin fabric. No worries!! There's no show-through even though the pants are unlined. If you're a larger cup size  you'll probably need to wear a tube top or bandeau under this for more coverage. I'm not judging if you want to show off your goodies. The belt is long enough to wrap around twice. I did this for extra cinching. The color I chose is more of a sage green than a true mint. Pay close attention to the size chart. I found it to be very accurate. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the X-Large.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1
fun,Another quality fun product from Fisher-Price!. My grandson absolutely flipped out over this set. He loves the colors and the music and the elephant (he even takes it into bed with him  lol). I love Fisher-Price  and I buy their products almost exclusively for my grandkids. Educational  safe  and so much fun. I love the fact that the legs on the elephant move so my three year old grandbaby can move it across the floor like it was alive! No complaints at all about this product and I  too  have purchased other items in the Little People series and this one set is just as good  if not better  than others I have bought. This would make a wonderful Christmas or Holiday present for the little one in your life.,1

historical details from nursing during the war,surprisingly good- but not a cheerful read. I was reading this for a book club- and enjoyed it much more than I thought I would!

smaller size when it's just me,"Convenient. These disposable grills are awesome for a quick  easy bbq.  They are perfect for ""precooked"" like hotdogs/brats.  If you want to grill something raw  chicken/beef  I find a piece of foil over the top of cooking food is helpful to focus the heat.  I love that the ""charcoal"" is all natural and no lighter fluid is necessary. I use the smaller size when it's just me. The larger size cooked 8 hotdogs and 4 brats easily (space).  I also like the sanitary aspect of using these... no grill to clean or grilling on a surface that might not be cleaned well. NOTE:  Beware of using the wire brushes on your grill - the metal brissles can be ingested and puncture your intestines - which is life threatening not to mention painful!  When using a regular grill  once the grates have cooled you can soak the grill grates in garbage sack with a little detergent. Next day  hose them off. Yeah  it's a little more of a hassle  but NO metal brissles to ingest. All in all  these disposable grills are really meant for ""lightweight"" grilling projects. I just like the additional positive aspects of using them  like the cleanliness aspect. Hope this info helps!",1
soft and very cute items,Baby Aspen Four-piece Gift Set. purchased for a beach themed baby shower and it was huge hit.... the grandma-to-be carried it around.

quality chalk bag,"Mixed feelings. I loved this chalk bag online  but in person  not as much - only because it seems more like a man's chalk bag. It is rather large in size and the color seems darker in person. I love prAna products and enjoy their clothing line and headbands  but this definitely seems like a man's chalk bag. So much so that I gifted it to a guy friend and he loves it and uses it all the time. On that note  I will say that the bag is great quality and the design is really unique. If you're looking for a larger  quality chalk bag for climbing  this is a great one to own. I just wish it wasn't labeled as a ""women's chalk bag""  because it really is more ambiguous. Climb on!",1

If you're not a fan of falsies  this is a great alternative. The formula isn't waterproof  so keep that in mind. I HIGHLY recommend this product.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1
felt based tips,"chair leg covers. We just installed a bunch of new vinyl flooring where carpet had been. So  instead of the plastic nubs that help you slide on carpet  you need to switch to the felt based tips.  We've been through a whole passel of felt squares - our chairs have 1 1/4"" square legs.  The felts with the stickers just slide off and never stay in place.  I never tried the ""tack"" on or screw on types for fear of harming my floor - and then we found these!  These are a really good design.  They are different than other silicone sleeve with the felt squares only at the bottom... those slip and tear the silicone  eventually coming off.  SO FAR - these have stayed in place perfectly  without slipping.  Key is that the felt square rounds UP the side of silicone sock.  Slides A LOT better across the floor as you're sitting on the chair than any of the other stick on felts.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.  Time will tell if these are as good as they seem to be.  We have four chairs so we used 16 tips and you get 24.  So there are replacements should they become necessary.  I think it's important that they fit snugly on the chair feet so measuring is important.  If you're tired of changing your chair foot felts  I say give this one a try.  They have multiple colors to choose from too.",0

tenure,"The Best (No Further Title Required). As a poet  there are a few places I'd love to be published. There's the New Yorker  the Atlantic  and Poetry Magazine. There are other places I want to see my work  but these three are  to me  huge. They vet the best poems  and publish them.  Only Poetry focuses on poetry. A review of their history would tell you they have tenure. Great poets are published here. Ones we all know  and ones we all should know. Unlike the New Yorker and the Atlantic  Poetry is especially open to unknowns. If you are good enough  you are in  whether you are famous or not.  Like most literary magazines  the design is clean  almost simple. Here  considering everything from paper color to typography  poems are more than printed: they are framed. No  no  no fancy design. Rather  they clear the way so that the poems are highlighted. Nothing but.  An essay and a few reviews finish each issue  followed by a couple pages of ads. All black and white.  If you are looking to buy a true literary magazine  as much curated as it is edited  pick this one. Don't do it to ""support the arts "" but because each issue is worth the time and money.  I fully recommend Poetry.  Anthony Trendl americanspeechwriter.com",1
extra cleaning cloths,Love it! No chemicals needed!. I love my Bissell Steam Mop.  Easy to put together  just fill and use.  I hate string mops. I feel like I'm just smearing the dirt to new places no matter how well I wash out the mop.  To me  it takes a little longer to use this mop than others but I think it's well worth it because it's sanitizing the floor as I mop.  A swiffer would work similar but only for quick clean up.  This is a no chemical  steam clean.  I would let a baby play on my floor after using this  but not after using a string  sponge or a swiffer mop. They just don't clean good enough. If you have a tough spot  just let the steamer sit on it for a few seconds. It'll clean up all of the goo.  I recommend buying extra cleaning cloths so you can just change them out as they get dirty.  No pushing dirt around. Toss the cloths in the washer and you're done.  No putting your hands in dirty water or on disposable cloths filled with chemicals.,1

plugged into a GFI outlet,"Mixed blessing  but so far  so good. I looked at probably 20 portable ice makers before choosing this one. Price was a factor  but so was customer input from reviews. It seemed like many of the other models were the exact same machine with a different company label stuck on them  and their reviews were so varied  it seemed like you either got a lemon or a good one.  Also  all the others opened at the top and vented on the side. For some reason  I thought this one would work better in our area  with the drawer pulling out at the front  and I THOUGHT the vent would be at the side like all the other machines.  My purpose in buying this is not for a bar or camper  like many people. I am partially disabled  and can't get downstairs to the kitchen on any sort of regular basis. I really wanted to be able to have ice when I wanted some  especially with the heat of summer rolling in very  very soon. I don't like room temperature drinks  esp water or tea  so I'd found myself drinking Pepsi almost exclusively  the only thing I could stand at room temp. That needed to stop!  So  I ended up buying this one  but the experience was not a pleasant one. I love my Amazon prime dearly  but they really botched this one. The shipping dates got moved around even after I paid extra for one-day shipping  and ended up with this being delivered on a totally different day  when I was the only one home and could not come to the door. (Note that Amazon did end up giving me a small credit on my acct to try to make up for the shipping problem  even though it did not solve my problem.) I always chat with the UPS guys through the upstairs window  so they left it for me anyway. I knew my son would be home very shortly after  and he was. He brought the box up  and I have to say that I am almost positive I got a customer return. The box looked like it had previous shipping labels peeled off of it. The box was beat up  torn  and had a crushed in spot on the side. Our UPS guys are really great  so I think it was shipped out from Day One looking like that - who in the warehouses think customers really want something that looks that bad?! (And yes  I know this is a product review section  and I can file shipping problems elsewhere  and I will. Just giving folks a heads-up of how it is shipped and what I received.) This is shipped in its original mfg box with tie cords on it  there is no other packaging other than what the mfg sends it out with - no Amazon packaging whatsoever. Strike One.  I opened the box  not sure of what I would find. It only has two big strips of styrofoam on the sides to hold it. Ours indeed had a dent in the side  and one of the back exhaust fans had cracked plastic. Not a crisis  but at this price  I really do expect a brand new item in great condition! Strike Two.  SMELLS/TASTE: I read a lot of reviews that talk about the plastic smell and/or taste in the cubes  and how it didn't seem to want to fire up well. IF someone reads the directions (not everyone likes to do that!)  you'd see it says to make sure the machine sits for at least an hour to allow the coolant to properly settle back into place after you unpack it. This particular model also says to run a bleach solution through it to help clean it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT!! The machine indeed smells heavily of plastic. Anyone who has had a relay switch burn out on an item knows what smell I am talking about - sort of like melting plastic. Ugh. However  having read plenty about portable ice makers before buying one  I knew that either vinegar or lemon juice would also work just fine. I chose to go with one that was ingestible  rather than bleach!! We did the lemon juice  and ran an entire cycle of cubes through it with the lemon/water. (Toss the ice please!) I then ran two loads (all the cubes a full water tank would make) through it of plain water. AFTER those cycles  I wiped it out again and ran regular water through it to try making cubes we'd use. We had no problems at all with any funny tastes in our ice this way. If you have a bad quality of tap water though  I'd suggest using either bottled  filtered or distilled water. It is only natural that your cubes will not taste better than your tap water. Ours is okay  so we're good that way. I would have bought a water filter (like a Brita) if that had not been the case. No lemony taste  no plastic taste  no gross tastes or odors at all. (Remember  I really do NOT recommend using bleach like the mfg suggests. While I understand the germ-killing properties of the bleach  I really don't want to ingest any of it. I would also think it would be much more caustic to the plastic parts and hoses of the machine  wearing them out sooner. Stick with lemon juice.) It did smell like plastic out the exhaust fan for quite a while  but it is fading away.  NOISE: Of course it is going to make noise. This has a compressor  and it will be making some noise. However  I've found that at its noisiest part of the cycle  it is no different than a microwave oven running  sometimes a little quieter.The ice cubes dumping make me jump a little bit  at least at first  but then again I am easily startled. Made the cats jump too! LOL! However  they are pretty much used to it now  even if they eyeball it suspiciously while it is running.  I have to say that I haven't stopped to time an actual cycle to make the ice. I've tried the small  medium and large cubes though. They are all gumdrop-shaped (or like the Dots candy at the movies)  with a hole in the middle of the bottom. It didn't seem to take very long though. The small ones were a little too small for my uses  but would be good for smaller drink glasses. I use a [[ASIN:B003X46LHG Bubba Brands Keg 52 Oz Mug Slate Gray]] to hold the ice at the moment  and love it. If you use the medium size  you can get the first batch in around 10 minutes  but the other batches do seem to take longer for some reason. It has also seemed to get ""stuck"" where it runs and runs  with nothing going on. I turn it off  let it sit a minute and push start again  and off it goes. I am not sure if it is just my machine with the dents from rough handling  or if all of this model is like that.  I was disappointed that this unit does not exhaust on the side  reason being where I planned to locate it  on a table behind my bed! It would vent towards my pillow  which is just not gonna happen. So  I have it turned sideways so it will vent towards the doorway. It makes opening the ice drawer more awkward  and makes me wish I'd tried one of the top-opening models now. There wasn't anything in the photos and such to suggest that this unit would be different than most of the other portable ice makers. It is. I'll post photos at a later date.  This model's book also suggests plugging the machine in to a GFI outlet  or grounded plug that will shut off if it senses dampness. I don't have one in the bedroom  and currently am using a heavy-duty  three-prong extension cord and plugging it in in the bathroom  where we do have a GFI plug. Not ideal  but better than trying to get a special outlet installed in a rented bedroom.  The scoop is VERY tiny. It works best to scoop towards you  so you don't send ice cubes back into the machine. The measuring cup works well for pouring  because you have a small reservoir to fill  and you have to go over a small clear rubber ""wall"" that helps to hold the drawer in place and hold temperatures.  Any unused ice does indeed melt back into the reservoir and is recycled back into cubes. Once I have enough ice for anyone who wants it  I turn it off rather than let it continually cycle. I also unplug it in the evenings when I go to bed for the night  since I'm the only one who can't go downstairs for ice if they want it. I hope that saves on the ""vampire electricity"" of the unit. Note that this is not a refrigerated ice maker  and the unused ice WILL melt. Many people complained about ice cubes stuck together - I've only experienced that when getting ice that has been done for an hour or so (it keeps the ice for at least an hour after the last cycle at this point) - otherwise  the cubes are all loose and easy to use. If you try to take the ice drawer all the way out after leaving the ice sit for a while  it WILL leak water on you - the water is simply the ice melting back and going through the drain holes that let it run back into the reservoir. (Nope - I didn't even think about the drainage holes when I pulled the drawer out the first time  and had water on the table and the floor. That was my fault though.)  For now  I am mostly happy with it. I cannot tell you how nice it is to have ice when I want it  instead of waiting for someone to get home in the evening and get me some! It was an expensive luxury though  and one I really thought long and hard about getting since I can no longer work. I'm thinking I really want to keep it. The cosmetic issues were VERY annoying  since I paid for a new machine  not a used one  but in this case  I blame Amazon for sending this out with a crushed box from the get-go. I would not have accepted it  had I been able to get to the door and saw it. Again - for some reason  this was the most problematic purchase I've ever had in all my time on Amazon.  This machine has not reached Strike Three yet  but you can be sure I'll come back and update my review should that happen. For now  I'll keep running it  and see how it seems to work  dents  cracked exhaust grid and all. (The dents are even more annoying  because it has a stainless steel appearance. It shows readily. It was more of a hassle to return it than to just keep it  as long as it continues to work.)  UPDATE June 29  2012: Well  I've had this machine for a little over a month now. Is it perfect? Nope. Does it make ice? Yep. Does it make a little noise?  Yep  but not unbearable. So far  the broken parts do not seem to be affecting the basic function of the machine. While I still have not literally timed the cube cycle (I have good intentions  but seems like there's always something better to do than watch the clock for ice cubes to drop! Ha!)  I have found the medium cubes to be the most useful. In fact  I often use an empty Sobe Lifewater bottle to make quick tea (loving the new tea from Lipton with the honey in it)  and the medium cubes fit in this bottle perfectly. So  that might give folks a better idea about the size of the medium cube. The difference in the sizes are basically more (or less) layers of ice on the cubes. The small ones are still too big for a basic 16.9 oz water bottle  and melt too fast when I shake up my tea. The first batch of the day takes around 10 minutes  but for some reason  they are skinnier than the normal mediums. The machine makes additional batches inbetween 10-15 minutes. Around 2 or 2-1/2 of the water cup it comes with to fill the reservoir to maximum. That will fill the ice bin to the top with medium cubes.  At this point  I increased my stars by one  because of the function of the machine  and it being willing to do what I ""hired"" it to do - keep me in cold drinks. Strike three has not yet happened  and I hope it doesn't! Enjoy!",1
well packaged,One of the greatest string quartets of all time.. Like  new even though it is 30years old.  Well packaged with quick shipment.  One of the best of all time string quartets.,1
rescue maine coon cat,awesome. awesome !!  i just adopted a rescue maine coon cat and she had quite a few mats  this works really well,1
cheaper too.,good product!. I've been using these in place of plastic utensils for a few months and really love them. They work well  they are a good size  and the pouch holds everything together. It's nice to just wash & reuse instead of constantly wasting plastic utensils...cheaper too.,1
best films,Great factual movie!. I thought this was one of the best films I have seen in a long time. Acting was wonderful (don't believe the other reviewers) and I thought the directing was superb. If you enjoy fact based movies  this is one that should not be missed. No small wonder it won at the Sundance Film festival last year. Great  great movie. Buy it and watch it with your high school/ college age kids!,1
difficulty understanding why Virgil would choose his old life over his new one,"Seeing is believing. ""At First Sight"" is based on the true story of a man who was blind for nearly his entire life due to cataracts and retinitis pigmentosa before having his sight temporarily restored. Based on an essay by British neurologist Oliver Sacks (who also penned Awakenings)  the film follows stressed-out New York architect Amy (Mira Sorvino) as she attempts to ""relax"" at a weekend spa retreat. At the reception desk  she frowns at the list of activities and settles on daily massages instead. At her first session  she meets Virgil (Val Kilmer)  a man with a truly magic touch. To her embarrassment  Amy breaks down crying as someone actually takes the time to touch her for the first time in a long time. Virgil  blind since childhood  excels as a massage therapist and enjoys hockey. Sensitive  constantly smiling and outgoing  he doesn't view blindness as a disability. Amy and Virgil begin seeing each other  but his prickly  overprotective sister Jennie keeps reminding her of Virgil's limitations as a blind man.  When Amy returns to New York and finds a doctor that is a pioneer in restoring vision  she urges Virgil to consider having the operation. This is the start of a very honest and painful dialog between Virgil  Jennie  and Amy as a child  Virgil was subjected to every manner of faith healing in an attempt to cure his blindness. The remainder of the film deals with the aftermath of the surgery and the strain that Virgil's newfound sight places on his and Amy's relationship. After being blind for decades  Virgil's brain is unable to cope with the new flood of visual input  and he is only able to ""see"" by touch for the first few days. It's a refreshing twist on Hollywood portrayals of narrators succumbing to blindness and the sentiment of ""Rage  rage against the dying of the light."" Instead  director Irwin Winkler and the gorgeous cinematography by John Seale paint Virgil's world of darkness in terms of touch  sound (the gorgeous rainstorm that allows Virgil to ""see"" Amy puts [[ASIN:B0002XVQNU Daredevil (Director's Cut)]]'s CGI rain effect to shame!!) and smell (Virgil initially describes Amy as smelling like cinnamon  nutmeg and vanilla  to which his sister says it sounds like he's describing a coffeecake). His post-op world is one of blurry  super-saturated colors  sudden movements  and confusion  and similar to Asperger's Syndrome  Virgil has to learn to ""read"" facial expressions and visual cues.  Winkler deftly balances the romantic story with the medical one  although the film feels a touch long and could have benefitted from some editing (I wasn't crazy about Nathan Lane's cameo  although I love him in other films such as [[ASIN:0792833198 The Birdcage]] ). Kilmer handles pre- and post-op Val with tenderness and insight as a blind man  he relies on his other senses like touch and hearing to guide him  but sight proves more treacherous and difficult than living in a familiar world of darkness. Sorvino's Amy was sweet and supportive  although at times she has difficulty understanding why Virgil would choose his old life over his new one.  The beautiful visual metaphors and the love theme ""Love Is Where You Are"" by Diana Krall only add to the tender appeal of ""At First Sight.""",1
daughter's cat does not seem too interested,cat string on stick toy. I get more joy out of these than my daughter's cat does.... sigh.... she doesn't seem too interested... she is hard to engage in anything though and she's older ( 7+ years).... I am thinking if you had a kitten it would be the bomb.. and maybe with a little catnip??,0
Canon is excellent,Canon MP480 all in one. I owned Lexmark Pinter about 4 of them and 3 HP. I like this one the best  even it was less expensive than my other printer. Reason: I never had a printer in which the Ink lasted 3X as long as Lexmark  the other printer nickel and dimes you to dead over the ink to expensive and does not last.  Cannon ist excellent,1
no felt,fabric fusion glue. Ok.  This stuff works.  IF you're gluing FABRIC to FABRIC.  Nothing else.  And NO felt.  Another note.  Use gloves or tweezers to apply.  Wash immediately if you get any on your skin.  If you have 2 layers  makes sure to put something plastic between the two layers.  I haven't tried to wash it yet  but I think it's pretty solid.  Having said all of that  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,0
blend reasonably well,Love the colors in this sponge set sponge texture is light metal holder is great. This is a lovely set of three sponges in nice colors of  pink  burgundy  and teal. It also comes with a great metal sponge holder  a silicone brush cleaner  and some cleaning solution. The sponges are light and airy like most sponges like this on the market.   The burgundy sponge with the flat side is great for smooth applications. The typical egg-shaped (teal) and the hour-glass (pink) sponges are good for blending or any large make-up application. The hour-glass one is easy to hold in the center.  These feel good in the hands  blend reasonably well  and feel soft against my skin. These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.  I personally do not use a silicone sponge cleaner. I prefer to use my hands and soap and water but having the silicone cleaner with cleaning solution provided is a nice touch.  The sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges as well as whether it is for gifting or not. The colors are important too--at least to me.   The current price of $7.99 is a great deal for this.,1
not exactly essential,Single disc version of John Denver's Wildlife Concert. Half-of his double-disc Wildlife Concert release  The Best of John Denver Live is a bit of a misnomer.  There are a lot of hits in the 16-song track list  yes.  But a lot of well-known Denver favorites are missing and replaced with less essential deep cuts.  Docked one star for that slight.  Quibbling  I know.  Regardless  it's a nicely packaged representation of the late singer / songwriter's concert program  played by an exceptional band and sung by a late-career John Denver in very good voice  indeed.  Produced for disc by Bob Irwin  who does his usual masterful job.  Not exactly essential  but definitely recommended.,0
recycle our newspapers and other paper materials,Useful product. We use these to recycle our newspapers and other paper materials.  Very useful to have around for us. Good service from seller.,1
guitar couldn't be played as-is,1 star for guitar  5 stars for Amazon. I was excited to purchase this guitar as a family gift for Christmas. There are several good reviews for it on Amazon and other sites  so I felt hopeful. Unfortunately  when we brought this guitar to a friend to be tuned  he pointed out a few things that totally escaped my amateur eyes - namely  the bridge was cracked  and one of the strings was strung improperly and played with a noticeable hum. We had it taken to a professional guitar shop  where we were told he could make it &#34playable&#34 for about $30  but it would never be top quality. Since the guitar couldn't be played as-is  we returned it as a defective item to Amazon. I'll think more about how much I want to invest in a guitar and go with some more professional opinions in the future.  IMPORTANT to note: the return process with Amazon was insanely easy. I followed the prompts on the website to return the item  printed out the appropriate form  repackaged everything  and Amazon sent UPS to come pick it up at my house  complete with a free return shipping label included! Now *that* is how you keep customers!!,0
confusing,Liked it a lot. Samantha  a nurse is kidnapped by an FBI agent on the run with a young boy. She ends up going on the run with them and helps him to discover who wanted them dead. A lot of suspense  a good plot and decently written. A few misspelled words and bouncing between POV's without warning was confusing. Also  too many scenes were neatly explained away and too many simple daily functions were never included which took away the believability of the story. Aside from that I adored the family dynamic and the happily ever after.,0
perfect as a teether,"Excellent infant teether with gum massaging nubs drop resistant. There is one BPA-free silicone teether in this package. The silicone is super soft. I consider this cute and engaging. This is easy for the baby to grab and hold onto. It has no sharp edges or parts that can fall off. This is perfect as a teether and is one solid piece. I also love that the ears have nubs which act as a gum massaging / tooth cleaning ""tool."" As is typical  always supervise when the baby is using this. This is rated for 0 to 12 months.  This is made in China. The current price of $6.29 ($6.99 minus 10%) is competitively priced for this. Overall  I consider this a great teether that is drop resistant and small enough for newborns. I had given one like this to my neighbor's infant and he absolutely loved it.",1
flamingo print,Great product. I buy a blueberry brand collar with a new tag for my sons 9 pound dog every Christmas.  Bought the flamingo print for Christmas 2019. No problems so far and has held up like all the previous ones I’ve purchased.,1
absorbent,Pampers are great diapers!. These diapers are great.  They are absorbent and lightly scented.  I've had no problems with leaking.,1
nice stones,Pretty Bracelets. These are pretty bracelets. There are 7 identical bracelets and then 7 unique ones. They have a good stretch to them so they can fit a variety of wrist sizes. They are pretty and have nice stones. These would be perfect for goody bags!,1
Must have,Awesome Funko Pops. Still waiting to receive this but I had to...Boba Fett and Carbonite Han. Must have!,1
leaves skin feeling soft,Softest hands ever  lightly scented w/ lemongrass oil  lemon oil  orange oil  rosemary. I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!)  and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft  smooth  clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F)  dry day. Super moisturizing.  Oddly  I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps  and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches  nausea)  but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners)  I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass  but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil  orange oil  and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean  but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.  I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent  and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich  super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did  I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here  lol. I kinda want it as a body wash. My hands feel SO GOOD after using this. I just keep touching my hands.  One does not need a lot of soap  so feel free to just add a little to the hand. I would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down. Or if you like this soap and have a foamer  then just a wee bit of this with a lot of water will do it.  Love their designs on the bottles.  Water  Organic Coconut Oil  Organic Olive Oil  Vegetable Glycerin  Organic Guar Gum  Lemongrass Oil  Orange Oil  Organic Jojoba Oil  Lemon Oil  Rosemary Extract  Organic Aloe Vera (Potassium Hydroxide is used to saponify the organic oils into soap  but none remains in the final product),1
hair is smooth and silky,Another great Amazon Solimo brand!. I try to get keratin treatments to keep my hair smoother and minimize frizz several times a year. When I do  I have to always use shampoos that are paraben and sulfate free. And  you guess it  the shampoos are usually more expensive than regular shampoos. When I saw this Amazon brand shampoo I wanted to try it. Usually  Solimo products are just as good as named brand varieties. This shampoo did not disappoint! After using this shampoo for almost a month now  several times a week  my hair is smooth and silky and is just as good as shampoos I have spent three times more for. I also love this coconut fragrance  too! Highly recommend this quality shampoo for all hair types  but particularly for those who want their hair shiny  frizz free and smelling great!,1
chunky relish,deli style (chunky) relish. This is really hard to find locally.  I purchase this  the sweet and the dill.  I like it because it's chunkier  bigger than the fine grind on other brands.  It also tastes better to me (of course that's personal opinion).  I wish I could get it locally  but Amazon is always my 'deliver to you door' backup.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should any new info seem useful.,1
takes a little longer to use,Love it! No chemicals needed!. I love my Bissell Steam Mop.  Easy to put together  just fill and use.  I hate string mops. I feel like I'm just smearing the dirt to new places no matter how well I wash out the mop.  To me  it takes a little longer to use this mop than others but I think it's well worth it because it's sanitizing the floor as I mop.  A swiffer would work similar but only for quick clean up.  This is a no chemical  steam clean.  I would let a baby play on my floor after using this  but not after using a string  sponge or a swiffer mop. They just don't clean good enough. If you have a tough spot  just let the steamer sit on it for a few seconds. It'll clean up all of the goo.  I recommend buying extra cleaning cloths so you can just change them out as they get dirty.  No pushing dirt around. Toss the cloths in the washer and you're done.  No putting your hands in dirty water or on disposable cloths filled with chemicals.,1
cleans the bottom of the bowl better,Small But Powerful. These brushes are actually smaller than the normal brushes  and I have discovered that their smaller size cleans the bottom of the bowl better.,1
elastic band keeps tools in place,hard shell travel case for hair tools. Got this to &#34house&#34 a small roller type stick and flat iron.. a couple of rat tail combs and a small can of hairspray for my Mom's short hair.  It fits nicely under her sink and is easy to grab. It fits the standard length instruments perfectly. It's lined with a soft  fuzzy material - an elastic band on side keeps your tools in place and the other side has a handy mesh flap perfect for combs  etc. I great zipper keeps everything where it needs to be and then... a super handy handle.  I am very  very happy with this purchase as it fit my needs so well.  I will  of course  update my review should new info seem useful.,1
purchasing more,Wow - really works!!. This is amazing!!! Will be purchasing more when needed,1
Fits the wellie wish dolls ok,Three Stars. Fits the wellie wish dolls ok. Kinda big on the straps and tight to get on,1
hung it up in my hallway,"Beautiful  well boxed/protected and arrived in PERFECT condition.. My handy man hung it up in my hallway yesterday and it's BEAUTIFUL! Exactly as I pictured. Just inside the front door  it's the perfect place for a jacket  the dog's leash and even my small ""walking"" purse. Beautiful!",1
handle is about two inches shorter than I would like,Good  hefty brush but short handle massaging side not useful to me. I tried several brushes over the last several months and love the KOZIS Wooden Bath Brush (Amazon item # B08HR2GBHC) the best. However  this one is very good too.  The brush head side is ample for good coverage. The bristles are of medium softness. The massaging side is not useful to me because I have no desire to use that. In fact  I do not even understand why anyone would use that.   The brush is hefty and is one solid piece  which is fabulous as the head cannot fall off the handle like some other brushes I tried previously. It also has a rope loop to hang up in the shower. In addition  a self-stick hook is supplied if needed but I did not use it.  Besides the massaging brush head that I find useless  the only negative to me is that the brush handle is about two inches shorter than I would like. Many brushes have a longer handle and a longer handle is best when trying to reach my back. Nevertheless  this is still very functional and it is very well made.  Overall  I like this brush even though it comes in second to the KOZIS I love. The current price of $11.99 is about right for a two-sided wooden brush.,0
Asian-inspired dishes,“There is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”. Susie Fishbein’s bestselling series “Kosher By Design” goes out with a bang with the final ninth volume “Kosher By Design Brings It Home.” Inspired by Susie’s travels to France  Italy  Mexico  Israel  and North America  you’ll find kosher versions of favorites such as Korean short ribs  lasagna bolognaise  and shoyu tamago ramen (which normally has a pork-based broth here in Japan).  I have several kosher cookbooks that I cook from regularly (Including The Joy of Kosher and “The New Kosher”)  but this was my first experience with the “Kosher By Design” series.  The menu leans most heavily towards Israeli and Italian dishes  including staples like arancini (fried stuffed risotto)   ravioli  Tuscan bean and farro soup  veal scallopini  brachiole  (fried) pizza Napolitana  ragu Napolitano  and lasagna  but you’ll also find Asian-inspired dishes (short ribs  spicy kim chee hangar steaks   ramen  chicken adobo) and Latin flair in the form of chicken flautas  ceviche  and pulled beef tacos.  The salads and dairy / fish sections were particular favorites of mine. I love light  refreshing salads for nearly every meal  and the Israeli-inspired salads here are perfect for hot  hazy days when you don’t feel like spending hours at the stove. I loved the Provencal wheatberry salad  Lumina market salad  Carmel Spa pomegranate almond salad (I use pomegranate molasses as a salad dressing and was happy to see it in a recipe!)  kale squash Caesar salad  root vegetable apple salad  and Chedva’s warm French potato salad was a revelation: baby potatoes  haricots verts  and a tangy white wine-herb dressing made this memorable (to make it dairy  you can add crumbled feta while warm).  Poultry includes rosemary lavender chicken  Amalfi sage chicken  and mustard caper chicken  and the meat dishes include various roasts  grills  and stews: pumpkin braised short ribs are perfect for fall  while the lamb cholent “cassoulet” reminded me of my trip to France’s Perigord in 2012. Dairy dishes include decadent bread pudding  farroto  pasta frittata  and risotto  while the fish dishes really shone: I loved the silan-glazed salmon (see photo) and the showstopping citrus-glazed salmon  layered with rows of perfectly symmetrical cucumber slices atop a citrus mayo. I also enjoyed trying my hand at the khachapuri shakshuka having taught many students from Georgia  I’d long heard of the magic of khachapuri but had never tried making it before. Susie’s clear instructions (and the easy shakshuka topping save the extra for omelettes and scrambled eggs!) make this a winner for breakfast or brunch.  Vegetarians have many options in the sides chapter  including a beautiful (and deceptively simple) eggplant and tomato tart (see photo)  tershi and couscous (I’m a fan of all things pumpkin and had not heard / tried this amazing Libyan Jewish dish before)  sweet potato wontons with teriyaki dipping sauce  chestnut tomato quinoa  and freekeh pilaf. Desserts are sure to tempt with a delightfully sweet/tart lemon tiramisu  Beresheet Spa Kanafe  banana  date  and pecan cake  almond bobka ring  halvah baklava  and fudgy New Fishbein Brownies punched up with espresso powder. Recipes are clearly labeled as meat  dairy or pareve (with some having multiple options depending on dairy-free substitutions) using color-coded icons. Note that some spellings use the Hebrew / Ashkenazi variations (chummos for hummus  seviche for ceviche  bobka for babka  etc.). I love that the font is a little larger and easily readable from several feet away as I tend to cook using a cookbook holder (and the ingredients are handily in bold). Each recipe comes with a full-page photo by John Uher showcasing each dish. The recipes (main dishes in particular) tend to be more elegant / upscale than some of my other kosher cookbooks (dishes like dried fruit and quinoa stuffed capons  turkey breast with hoisin tangerine glaze  and pumpkin braised short ribs would all make wonderful holiday centerpieces)  but there are also plenty of recipes that come together quickly for weeknight meals (the eggplant and tomato tart  fish dishes  and veggie sides).  Overall  “Kosher by Design Brings It Home” is a wonderful finale to Susie’s best-selling series (with nearly 500 000 books sold) and a great way to taste the world from the comfort of your (kosher) kitchen Susie’s headnotes introduce the reader to places and people she’s encountered on her fifteen-year culinary journey spanning several continents and multiple food traditions  from Italian nonnas to Yemenite family recipes passed down across generations. But at the end of the day  in Susie’s words  “there is nothing like the comfort found in bringing it home.”  (Thank you to the Trina Kaye Organization for the review copy!),1
imagination this author has,Awesome. Tucker's Way was an absolutely awesome read --- what a woman(Tucker)  what an imagination this author has!  Can't wait to see what else he has waiting for me.  Definitely recommend this book !!!,1
more for a child’s face,Very small.. I was looking forward to receiving these brackets.  But  they are too small to use.  I do not have a broad face  big nose  chin  or big head.  These do not cover my nose and chin at the same time.  They are more for a child’s face.  It’s too much of a bother to send them back so I’ll be giving them to my son for the grandchildren. I have 3 different cloth masks and they don’t work with any of them.  They move around  possibly because they’re so small.  Also  being silicon  I expected them to be at least a bit softer but they are hard.  Very disappointed.,0
quality,Does the job intended with style... For a price point under $20- this is a top that can actually do its job and provide ample coverage as a base layer.. But  the shirt is multifaceted and can also be used as a light pullover to lend a layer of protection from the sun..  if going casual- this even has the ability to stand alone on its own!  Material feels nice and soft with a small stretchable quality.. although a synthetic  this has a breathable lightness to it. Seams are stitched straight and on point- no loose threads. Ordered in light gray it has a small dime size “logo” imprinted on the chest (ours is in the same color as the shirt..) almost unnoticeable except for it’s silver sheen. Both the length in sleeve and torso- are comparable to U.S. sizing chart. A nice solid fit thru the body which is helped in part by the elastin stretch the fabric provides- it eliminates the appearance of a square boxier cut + feel for those with slender builds.. and yet  this has room to fit and forgive a bit without looking seer-sucking! (I included photos of fabric of close  logo  seams + shirts cut.. in case it helps!?)  For reference: My son is- 6’4”  187lb  33x36  active but  not super athletic build..18yr. caught between a man/boy body! This shirt nicely drapes his silhouette vs. hangs on his body type. *Note: neck opening is a tad wider at the shoulder points which is different then usual round opening (in womens style this is referenced as a “boat neck” Im not sure if it was just us who noticed this anomaly.. but  something to take notice of. Not a deal breaker just creates a slightly different finished look.  For an unknown brand this has the quality and ability to do its job at a solid price. An item that can find its way into your wardrobe in 3 if not all 4 seasons and has the quality to hold up as long. Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe!,1
case is not very protective,"Not very protective - More for style. Got this Verso for my new 7"" HD Fire. I found the color bright and a really neon green  probably a little 'too bright' for a 50 something year old woman. I honestly think this color (and I assume the alternate pink as well) is better suited for teenagers. The case is thin and not very protective  though  so I think the idea of giving this to a teenager there may be better (more protective) alternatives. I would say go ahead and spen another $10 and get one of the better cases and skip the style/fashion side of a case for your Kindle.",0
size smaller than expected,Beautiful Quality Pearl  But A Little Smaller Than Same Size Class From Same Company. I have always wanted to have a pearl necklace.  Although it is not my usual style  I thought I would try one out.  The problem is that I did not have any earrings appropriate to wear with it.  That is where these came in.  HOW THESE ARE PACKAGED This is a beautiful set very appropriate for gift giving.  It comes in a cardboard sheath.  Inside there is a very beautiful blue box with a nice expensive looking finish on it.  Inside the box there is a plastic bag with a pair of earrings  silicone backs on them  extra backs  a white velvet bag  and a cleaning cloth.  QUALITY The earring pearls are beautiful in tone and quality.  They are shiny as you can see from the photo.  The camera reflection is showing on the pearl.  The tone of the pearl is what I call a rose taupe tint to it.  It is very slight  but it is warm and beautiful.  SIZE The size of these is not quite as big as I hoped it would be.  My necklace is from the same company and the color matches perfectly   but the size although listed as the same is bigger on the necklace.  Nevertheless  it looks good together and I am happy with it.  THE BOTTOM LINE This set of earrings is really nice.  It is good quality  well packaged  and a decent price.  MY RATING FIVE STARS.  Although I wish they were just a tiny bit larger  I still like them very much and the color is stunning.,0
potential for another title,Lots of Loose Ends are Finally Wrapped Up!. I have been waiting for the latest in the Body Movers series for a while. It was a super fast read. It was a little unrealistic at times  but I found it engaging and entertaining. Most importantly  it wraps up a lot of (if not all) of the loose ends. If this is the last in the series  then I feel satisfied. There's still potential for another title though.,1
So cute,Five Stars. So cute! Looks exactly as pictured. Fit on my 4&#34 round cake perfectly,1
aimed more at the novice cook,Beautiful cookbook  but aimed more at the novice cook. Naturally I'm familiar with Mary Berry from her role as host on the Great British Bake-Off (I've followed the careers of several of the alumni including Edd Kimber  Ruby Tanoh  and Nadiya Hussein)  but this was the first time I'd had the chance to peruse one of her many cookbooks. A legend in British culinary circles  Mary has published more than 75 cookbooks.  In &#34Cooking with Mary Berry &#34 she presents beautifully photographed dishes that lean towards the basic (pizza tartlets  nachos  hummus)  with a dash of well-known European dishes (coq au vin  chicken cordon bleu  boeuf bourguignon  mushroom stroganoff) and quite a few international influences in the form of Mexican / Tex-Mex (mole  shrimp tacos)  Asian  and even Indian and Middle Eastern (including vegetarian dishes such as falafel).  As Mary states in the introduction  her recipes have to meet three criteria: look good  taste good  and be practical to make. Her step-by-step technique photographs would be tremendously helpful for those new to the kitchen  and the limited number of ingredients make this a perfect cookbook for a student going off to college  for example. More experienced chefs will already know all of these tips and tricks  but it's nice to have a reminder from time to time! Some of the vegetarian dishes and sides appealed to me  although the recipes not surprisingly feature meat and seafood quite heavily. I'm also interested in trying Mary's breads and baked goods as that is what she is primarily known for.  This would make a great gift for a budding chef in your life  or if you have basic cooking skills and are interested in trying more adventurous international dishes.,0
stacking cookies,Must have  so handy!. I’m so happy I ordered these for all of the holiday care packages  easy clean-up  and stacking cookies!,1
comes off easily with my makeup wipes,Excellent variety pack of shadows!. Nice variety pack of eyeshadows. I love the muted neutral colors  go perfect with almost anything I wear. Also like the fact that these would make an excellent gift as well with the packaging. Colors last a super long time. When I apply in the morning (super easy to apply)  it remains all day and comes off easily with my makeup wipes at night. Highly recommend!,1
crunchy texture,"Awesome slime.. This kit has everything you need for a fun afternoon of slime making.  Except glue  but you can use any school glue. The crunchy one is cool because it really does"" pop"" when you squeeze it lol. The sparkly one has 2 bottles to make. They are a sparkly glitter and looks best with clear glue. We made it with white and clear glue. Both came out great. So nice to get a product that actually works like they promise.",1
cheap product,Don’t buy this product. This is a cheap product. It was broken right out of the case,0
wraps up a lot of (if not all) of the loose ends,Lots of Loose Ends are Finally Wrapped Up!. I have been waiting for the latest in the Body Movers series for a while. It was a super fast read. It was a little unrealistic at times  but I found it engaging and entertaining. Most importantly  it wraps up a lot of (if not all) of the loose ends. If this is the last in the series  then I feel satisfied. There's still potential for another title though.,1
undetectable in the water,Nice.. Clear and undetectable in the water. Strong and doesnt tangle too easy.,1
easy to fill and use with your trays,diamond drill organizers. I usually have several projects going at one time.  These boxes are a life saver to me as I can load them - I number the boxes with the color legend and makes it so easy!  They are easy to fill and use with your trays. They stay closed - so far anyway and I've used them over and over. Having said that.. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. At this point  I would purchase these again if I needed more.,1
hand scrubber poof,great self care set  fine quality  no issues  gift worthy items. Gift worthy set-comes with long back length silicone scrubber  a hand scrubber poof  a shower cap  and a set of hooks. All packed into a small box. Would make for a great stocking stuffer or as part of a themed self care gift.  I may pick up another set for this reason.  Everything is of good quality. I am extra impressed with the hand scrubber loofah/poof. It is rather robust. The longer silicone scrubber takes some getting used to. I have really come around to silicone scrubbers  as they just seem more hygienic to me. And even if you dont use bath wash on it (I often soap up my body  then run this over it)  it is lovely on the skin. Gentle  but effective. The shower cap is a nice addition. Use it in or out of shower.  No problems with this set. I think it is a great bundle of shower items. If I experience anything else  I will be back to update .,1
quality,Great fit. Perfect fit and perfect quality.,1
fun suspenseful and at time sexy read,I loved the whole series of Mudbug. I loved the whole series of Mudbug..Helena the ghost keeps this one funny with all the things happening to her as she &quotlearns&quot how to be a ghost.Each book tells you about the life and antics of one main character but it also combines the other ones with the new..the lives all intertwine and thtas what makes this a fun suspenseful and at time sexy read...It gets your heart pumping even just after you have laughted your a - - off lol..Going to read more from this author !!!,1
very durable but flexible,great case. LOVE this case!! I love the way this case feels and it’s very durable but flexible!,1
tough cleansing project,Bar Keepers friend. I prefer the liquid Bar Keepers and it's hard to get locally  so I order it.  It works really great on toilet rings!  And any other really tough cleansing project. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.

disappointing,Don't bother. Bypass this option for an American company version. It was very disappointing  inaccurately described  and no full refund on returns.,0
plays it all the time,greatest hits. Bought it as a gift for my mother for Christmas  it was a big hit. She loves it and plays it all the time,1
one half has the seed,Comfortable and cute. When I wear these avocado earrings with my avocado dress I get many compliments.  I like that one half has the seed  which you can see in my  side view pic   and one is hollowed.  Very comfortable  light  don’t even feel them.  Very happy with the colors too.,1
Darren comes into his own as a solo artist on TDTWM,"Darren truly comes into his own as a solo artist on TDTWM. Darren Hayes  former multiplatinum-selling frontman for Aussie duo Savage Garden ([[ASIN:B000BUXUUG Truly  Madly  Completely- The Best of Savage Garden]])  has come into his own on This Delicate Thing We've Made. It's been a whirlwind few years for Hayes: on his third solo album after [[ASIN:B0000630UH Spin]] (2002) and [[ASIN:B0002QCBE0 The Tension And The Spark]] (2005)  Darren parted ways with Sony  started his own label Powdered Sugar  and married his partner Richard Cullen in a civil ceremony in London.  As one review rightly pointed out  if Hayes was still attached to Sony / Columbia  no megaconglomerate record company would have ever financed anything as ambitious and hard to categorize as This Delicate Thing We've Made. Spanning 25 tracks on 2 CDs  the album is all over the place sonically in a tribute to some of Darren's idols  including Prince  Michael Jackson  and Kate Bush  and the authentic retro vibe is courtesy of a 1983 Fairlight CMI syth. Darren's earlier collaborations with Robert Conley on Spin (Crush (1980 Me) and Tension and the Spark continue on TDTWM  along with Justin Shave as producer (Justin played keyboards on Darren's Big Night In tour).  Even though there is a unifying theme of time travel  Darren's bouncing off the sonic walls  from funk to electro to boy band to uniquely Darren. Unexpected samples (barking dogs  airplanes  horses) crop up in the middle of songs  and two songs (Conversations with God and Neverland) strongly remind me of Tori Amos-influenced Casey Stratton ([[ASIN:B00016XO56 Standing at the Edge]])  who shares the same soaring falsetto and sense of lyrical drama.  My main issue is the balance between uptempo flirtations with electronica (club hit Step Into the Light  Casey  Listen All You People  Me  Myself  and I) and slower ballads  which make up most of the second disc. I feel that TDTWM lacks the overall cohesiveness of Tension and the Spark  and I find myself skipping over a few of the tracks (the aforementioned Bombs Up In My Face and the dark  gritty Setting Sun). However  TDTWM grows on me with each successive listen. It's such a nuanced  complex work that multiple listens are required to do Darren's creative vision justice. As with previous releases  there are several B-sides available exclusively  on the TDTWM singles [[ASIN:B000SFYGXY On the Verge of Something Wonderful]]  [[ASIN:B000SFZ05M On the Verge of Something Wonderful  Vol. 2]]  and [[ASIN:B000SN3VNM On the Verge of Something Wonderful]]: Step Into the Light remixes  Fallen Angel  and I Just Want You To Love Me  as well as a ""bootleg"" digital single available on Darren's official website (www dot darrenhayes.dloadshop.com/shop.asp?arid=2 ) that features God Is In The Room and Ocean.  Kudos to Darren for the creative  pass-the-good-karma origami bird marketing that ties in with TDTWM's theme. He encourages fans to print an origami bird  write a wish or note (world peace  happiness  someone loves you  etc.)  fold it  and leave it in a public place for others to find. If you find a bird  you can upload its location and a photo to neonbird dot com/something-wonderful",1
Easy to work with,Quality thick velvet yarn. Easy to work with and maintain even sides.  Did not need a border to have neat edges.  This is my favorite weight velvet yarn.,1
price goes up,Getting costly. I purchased these in June at a cost of $32. Now they're $34. They are nice plates  but not when the price goes up.,0
wetness indicator,Cute & Absorbent!. These diapers are not only cute  but absorbent  too! I love the little otter designs! The wetness indicator works well. There's a yellow stripe in the center of the diaper and when wet  it changes to blue. The stripe is along most of the length so it doesn't matter if it's worn by a boy or girl. The Velcro tabs are strong and stay in place well. The legs are gathered to help prevent leakage. I'm glad to see the that no chlorine bleach was used in the manufacturing process.,1
cheap material,Cheap cheap cheap cheap material. This does not look as full and vibrant as the picture! This is poorly constructed and entirely not flattering to anybody type! The material is so thin that you can see right through it and the feel of it just makes you break out in a rash just by looking at it before you even put it on. This is grotesque and if you cannot pronounce the name of the company you should not buy!,0

It has enough cushion to protect the laptop.  It also has pockets on the outside to hold the charger and other small items.  Well made.,1
"""just plain fun""","Interesting twists on dance/electronic. I first heard of Parisian DJ David Guetta (a fixture in Ibiza and Paris) on the ""Pioneer: The Album Vol. 3"" while living in Spain (Ibiza CDs are EVERYWHERE) with his fabulous single ""Love Don't Let Me Go."" After a long wait  ""Just A Little More Love"" is being released in North America---it's ABOUT TIME!!!. His album is a pleasing blend of styles and moods  all of it intensely danceable. The main highlight for me was not only Guetta's fantastic mixing  but the soulful  searing vocals by gospel phenom Chris Willis (backing vocalist for Amy Grant  CeCe Winans  Twilla Paris  Garth Brooks  and Dolly Parton among others) that made the album come alive. ""Just A Little More Love"" sounds like a throwback to the heyday of the `80s  with elements of funk and disco scattered throughout the driving beats. The album spawned a number of singles  including Ibiza megahit ""Love Don't Let Me Go."" This North American release features an altered tracklist from the European debut  adding the Just For One Day (Heroes) remix from Guetta's new album F*** Me I'm Famous (named after an Ibiza tradition)  cuts several others (Chris Willis' You  Atomic Food)  and substitutes edits for several (Just a Little More Love Elektro edit  Distortion vocal edit  Just a Little More Love Wally Lopez remix edit). The majority of the thirteen songs are vocal-driven  with the exception of 133 and Lately  both instrumentals. Themes range from the noble: social reform (Can't U Feel The Change)  self-empowerment (It's Alright)  love and desire (the campy Sexy 17  People Come  People Go  Give Me Something  the riveting Love Don't Let Me Go  You Are The Music) and just plain fun (Distortion). This North American release is much more geared for club play with the addition of Just For One Day and the edits/remixes. A danceable feast for the ears and refreshingly original. Remember to check out Guetta's new album F*** Me I'm Famous as well.",1
no complaints,Fun trivia game!!!. I love this game! No complaints!,1
definitely recommended,Single disc version of John Denver's Wildlife Concert. Half-of his double-disc Wildlife Concert release  The Best of John Denver Live is a bit of a misnomer.  There are a lot of hits in the 16-song track list  yes.  But a lot of well-known Denver favorites are missing and replaced with less essential deep cuts.  Docked one star for that slight.  Quibbling  I know.  Regardless  it's a nicely packaged representation of the late singer / songwriter's concert program  played by an exceptional band and sung by a late-career John Denver in very good voice  indeed.  Produced for disc by Bob Irwin  who does his usual masterful job.  Not exactly essential  but definitely recommended.,1
good old rock and roll,Gets you foot tapping. Lots of good old rock and roll. If you grew up from the 50's to the 80's you will like listening to these songs.,1
less stressed article,"Creative Recipe Ideas & Fun  Colorful Articles about Life. A real favorite in this magazine is the page of quotes  It is sure to bring a smile or teach you something about life. They also always have cleaning tips  health topics  diet and exercise solutions  true stories  beauty hints  inspirational articles  soul nourishing tips  recipes  recipes and more recipes  family/children  flowers  end of the magazine article to make you think about life  and gardening hints.  If you want to find a cover story fast  they have an ""on our cover"" section in the index. In Every Issue there is a shopper's guide and a recipe index.  The articles are helpful and in the March 2002 issue they had an article on how to be less stressed. They also had an article on PCOS which is apparently more common than we women think.  The beauty sections show you the newest fashion and you can decide if you want to adapt your style to the trends. Always seems rather chic.  Some of the recipes in the March 2002 issue included:  A luscious Lemon Coconut Pound Cake Coconut Macaroons Peanut Butter Oat Bars Baby Cheesecakes - really cute Banana Salsa French Oven Beef Stew Pasta with Shrimp  The recipes are not difficult and seem practical.  Even the advertising in this magazine is colorful and fun.  A Very ""American Gal"" type magazine. Nothing fancy  just real life.  ~The Rebecca Review",1
size,Wrong size. Had to return for a smaller case.,0
Solimo products are just as good as named brand varieties,Another great Amazon Solimo brand!. I try to get keratin treatments to keep my hair smoother and minimize frizz several times a year. When I do  I have to always use shampoos that are paraben and sulfate free. And  you guess it  the shampoos are usually more expensive than regular shampoos. When I saw this Amazon brand shampoo I wanted to try it. Usually  Solimo products are just as good as named brand varieties. This shampoo did not disappoint! After using this shampoo for almost a month now  several times a week  my hair is smooth and silky and is just as good as shampoos I have spent three times more for. I also love this coconut fragrance  too! Highly recommend this quality shampoo for all hair types  but particularly for those who want their hair shiny  frizz free and smelling great!,1
sponges are light and airy,Love the colors in this sponge set sponge texture is light metal holder is great. This is a lovely set of three sponges in nice colors of  pink  burgundy  and teal. It also comes with a great metal sponge holder  a silicone brush cleaner  and some cleaning solution. The sponges are light and airy like most sponges like this on the market.   The burgundy sponge with the flat side is great for smooth applications. The typical egg-shaped (teal) and the hour-glass (pink) sponges are good for blending or any large make-up application. The hour-glass one is easy to hold in the center.  These feel good in the hands  blend reasonably well  and feel soft against my skin. These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.  I personally do not use a silicone sponge cleaner. I prefer to use my hands and soap and water but having the silicone cleaner with cleaning solution provided is a nice touch.  The sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges as well as whether it is for gifting or not. The colors are important too--at least to me.   The current price of $7.99 is a great deal for this.,1

ordered this men's pair,Superb socks with extra cushioning stays in place while walking are also warm. I first bought a pair of these socks at REI for $27 and loved them. I wanted another color of the same sock so I purchased these. These socks are wonderful. They are slightly thick  sturdy  snug but not too tight  and feel fabulous on. They cushion my heel and bottom of foot and they do not move around like other socks  which helps prevent blisters. I walk a lot and these socks stay put even on a two-hour walk. I LOVE THEM.  One caveat  however. These socks must be an older model of the same sock that I purchased at REI. The reason I say that is because compared to the original sock I purchased  they are about two inches shorter. I then did some research and found a comparison chart for two of the same mountaineering socks by the same name. The only difference between the two models is that there's a slightly different fabric combination and it is not listed as quick drying.  To me both socks feel the same. I also ordered three more pairs. I now own five pairs of these socks and they are WONDERFUL! In fact  I love them so much that I ordered this [[ASIN:B01F47N7XK men's pair]] for my boyfriend. My boyfriend loves them as well. He wears them to bed.,1

birds seems to like it,All season suet packs. Arrived super fast - even though it noted a longer delivery time.  You get a case of 10 - for us that will last about 2 months into the winter.  We have numerous feeders.  The price was competitive compared to another brand I had purchased in the past.  Therefore  I likely order again if the price stays competitive.

after the set was washed it looked like I just took it out of the box,Can't buy a better set of cookware anywhere!. Let me begin by saying I love Circulon cookware. My kitchen is a walking advertisement for it. It is designed for the cook  from the detailed handles that fit correctly in the palm of your hand to the way the pots clean up beautifully. I have never had a problem with the non-stick cookware peeling or pitting or scratching in anyway (unlike the Calphalon I have had in the past). Now specific to this set: This is the perfect housewarming or shower present for the bride to be. This set will last for years and will make even the most novice chef appear to be a professional on the first try out. There is every size in the set (perhaps with the exception of a really large stock pot) which a chef could ever need. Last weekend  I actually used almost the whole set simultaneously cooking an Italian dinner for my extended family  and I can assure you the set was well used  scraped and stirred for several courses. After the set was washed   it looked like I just took it out of the box. Circulon may be a little more pricey than some lower cost manufacturers. But it's the old adage  you get what you pay for. Circulon is simply the best!,1
worth the money,Don't bother. Got 3 cups of coffee from each bag of beans. Not worth the money.,0
Japanese washoku,Simple recipes for a long life  the Shoku-Iku way!. Much like the traditional Japanese Buddhist shojin ryori  Shoku Iku (“food education”) is a Japanese concept involving conscious eating: what we eat  how we prepare it  and how different foods are combined. Much like the traditional Japanese Buddhist shojin ryori  shoku iku is based on the power of five: each meal should have five colors (green/blue  red/orange  white  black/brown  yellow)  tastes (sweet  sour  bitter  salt  umami)  senses  food groups and cooking methods (steam  simmer  broil  grill and fry  no-cook  sushi).  Makiko Sano’s new book “Healthy Japanese Cooking” (published in the UK as “Shoku Iku”) immediately caught my eye having lived in Japan on multiple occasions  I have long been attracted to Japanese washoku (traditional cuisine) and shojin ryori (Buddhist vegan cuisine). Traditional Japanese meals are based on the freshest seasonal ingredients  engage all the senses  and if eaten properly and with mindfulness  should leave you satisfied but not stuffed (the Japanese concept of hara hachi bu  or eat until you are 80 percent full).  Beginning with the essential dashi (stock) and dressings (rosemary soy  sweet soy  sesame salad sprinkle  shabu shabu and others)  there are very handy illustrations and step-by-step photos to instruct you on rolling sushi  julienning vegetables  etc. Dashi is the backbone of most Japanese soups / hot pots  and you'll find several variations here  including basic dashi (kelp + bonito flakes)  vegetarian dashi (kelp and dried shiitake)  Motoko's dashi (made with liquid from cooking brown rice I had not seen this method in my other cookbooks!)  and two soup stocks.  I found the chapter on steaming particularly helpful as I have not cooked fish via this method before  but you’ll find heavenly steamed sea bream  a posh cod dinner in 20 minutes  steamed chicken  stuffed veggies  pork dumplings  etc.  most cooked in the microwave. However  a word of caution these recipes were tested at 800 watts  and it would appear that American microwaves are more powerful in general (mine is 1.58 kW)  so you may need to adjust cooking times.  Some of the steamed dishes are cooked on the stovetop my new favorite discovery is the “Full Japanese” garden breakfast  full of leafy greens  tomatoes  mushrooms and eggs nestled into the greens. I also loved the vegan monk recipe for stuffed pumpkin and steamed sticky rice  which is full of carrots  shiitake  and mushrooms (you can leave out the chicken to make it vegan). And my favorite steamed custard chawanmushi also makes an appearance  as do perfect teatime snacks mochi  sweet potato treats  and fruit buns.  The fried chapter includes Japanese burgers and shrimp barbecue  but you’ll also find healthy low-fat vegetarian options like Japanese grilled vegetable “stir fry” (half grilled  half steamed)  eggplant and shallot salad  “full of goodness” (with a liberal helping of my favorite Japanese vegetable  lotus root!)  and chili tofu. The sushi chapter features an amazing brown shiitake and pumpkin sushi  temaki  sesame seed salmon sushi  brown rice tuna sushi with sweet-hot sauce  five senses super-tasty salmon sushi  and some new variations like wasabi cream cheese sushi with lamb  avocado and pear quinoa power sushi  and sushi canapes.  Ingredients are listed both in metric and US (volume). Beautiful full-color photos by Lisa Linder capture the aesthetic of Japanese cuisine  with beautiful tableware that offsets the featured dish perfectly.  The resulting dishes  all of which embrace the “shoku iku” philosophy  are light  nutritious  and provide plenty of variety of colors  flavors  and textures that are sure to brighten any meal. I found several new dishes that I plan on making frequently  including the egg and tofu dashi soup  rice noodles with mushroom broth  pan tai  iced tomatoes  brown shiitake and pumpkin sushi  and steamed sticky rice.  If you are new to Japanese cooking / flavors  then “Healthy Japanese Cooking” is the perfect introduction as it uses commonplace ingredients (you may have to order some of the more traditional ingredients like kombu and bonito flakes online)  simple techniques  and is aligned much more closely with the traditional Japanese diet based on fish and vegetables than many Japanese cookbooks aimed at Western audiences.  (Thank you to Makiko Sano for the review copy!),1
more colors,Love this. I love these tops....I've now ordered 3. They are sheer which makes it more comfortable to wear in layers. For the money spent  it is a great purchase. Will probably get a couple more colors.,1
awesome,super fun but be VERY CAREFUL>. this is not a toy.  but it is pretty awesome.  I wouldn't let a kid fly this unless he is carefully supervised.  i'm an adult with experience flying rc planes.  i was not comfortable when I turned it on.  it could really hurt someone.  there are a few quirks that don't get explained but there are enough users out there that help.,1
musicians,Sung Si Kyung's Winter Wonderland CD is a classic production for the ages.. I am very pleased with the purchase of Sung Si Kyung's Winter Wonderland CD. The production team  designers  and musicians really put their best efforts and talents in this CD and it shows. I have no doubt  this will become a classic choice for music lovers anywhere in the world. Once again Sung Si Kyung vocals warm the heart and now finally he sings all songs in English. One of my favorite songs in this production is his duet with Ailee: &#34Baby it's cold outside.&#34 Thanks to all artists involved in this project and of course to Jellyfish.,1
rotate the part that grips onto items,"Helpful Around Home. I'm 5'6""  so I'm not short  but our kitchen cabinets are way out of my reach. I hate having to drag the step stool in just to reach things on the top shelf. This tool is very helpful in those situations. And it's much smaller than the step stool and fits nicely in the pantry. I like that you can rotate the part that grips onto items. I also like that you can extend it at an angel is you want. It works pretty well for most items. I have found that the claw part (for lack of the official term) doesn't expand enough to fit around some things. I was trying to reach the container of salt so I could refill the shaker and it barely fit around that. Other than that  I like it.",1
recipes,Great recipes and articles. Interesting recipes that don’t that don’t have unusual ingredients.,1
hair falling apart,Average. Overall I like this bouffant. The fabric is thick and it is well made it fits well. I purchased it when I was working in the COVID unit. I have long hair and throughout the day it would fall apart and feels heavy  pulling and irritating my scalp. I am sure all the girls with long hair know what I am talking about. This bouffant has enough space to fit all of my hair inside without a hair tie. Being able to avoid touching my hair in a 12-16hr shift is a big plus. However  I am rating it 3 stars... because the color faded dramatically after just 1 wash  1 drying cycle. It's soooo faded now...  I recommend this product  just avoid dark color  so the fading is not too obviouse.,0
don't have to worry about the wires,Great set of microphones. We use these for at home karaoke. We plug into the ION Block Party wireless speaker and they work great. Wireless connectivity works a good distance  like over 100 feet. The wired mic that came with the speaker broke within like a week because the wire got tweaked. These are a great replacement and we don't have to worry about the wires.,1
acrylic paint,Better Than Using a Paper Plate!. My daughter enjoys painting in her free time. She uses acrylic paint that comes in little tubes and likes to blend her own colors. I ordered this for her because she was using a paper plate for her paints and this looked like it would be easier to use. It also keeps the paints separate and not touching accidently. It cleans up pretty easily  too.,1

bags haven't been opened once,Sturdy. I bought several of these and replaced my other TSA locks without the &#34entry&#34 notice.  Interestingly  since I put these locks on  my bags haven't been opened once.  I'm sure that is a coincidence.  These are sturdy  easy to use and seem effective.  The loop is average size... so it will fit through most suitcase zipper loops.  I will update if there are any issues.,1

works great for me,Family Doesn't Understand.... I got this as every time I do dishes and clean the sink out  I thought it would be easier for my family to see whats up with the dishwasher.

If it only came with a family training guide....,1
wireless charging not working on iPhone 11 Pro and LG Android phone,Great Size!. This is a great size for a UV cleaner. It's perfect for phones  earbuds  keys  mask  and more.

We couldn't get the wireless charging to work on either her iPhone or my LG Android phone.,0
mini desserts parfaits,5 oz cups with lids. I purchased these to put individual 7 layer dip inside.  Worked perfectly!  You could make mini desserts  parfaits or veggie sticks with dip at the bottom.. I would buy these again.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.,1
AuraCacia oils,LOTS OF ALLERGIES AND BEST Essential Oils I Ever Bought.. I bought this set last June and just opened it now. The fact that the oils are SO fresh upon opening nine months later says a lot.  A few things you have to understand:  The negative review about allergy upon skin contact is only ONE case. As someone with a ton of skin sensitivities and contact dermatitis  I also got a tiny bit itchy with mixing the orange  lemongrass and rosemary onto my skin but THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. These are 100% essential oil  NOT mixed with any kind of carrier. If you go to Whole Foods and buy one of the AuraCacia oils  many are mixed with jojoba oil so that they are easier on skin. Yes  they also have a line of 100% essential oils but these are a much better value. These are FULL POTENCY and VOLATILE which means yes  they *can* burn skin and SHOULD NOT be used on or around pets (do research as I know some oils are poisonous to cats). Any full potency oil can be extremely toxic to children if ingested. If you are making a batch of homemade lotion  DIY sanitizers or whatever else  you add like 4-5 drops for every CUP of product. More than that is going to be way too much. That said  this is actually a REALLY great value for this entire set. And non-GMO  Organic?!!! AMAZING.,1
skin is a lot smoother,Nice exfoliator - overpriced for my needs. This is a gentle exfoliator. Rating it 4 stars mainly because I didn't care for the aroma (somewhat strong) and I think it is way over priced. I am 60 years old and do not have crepe issues  but I do have aging skin and sagging issues. I have used this for two weeks now. I will state that my skin is a lot smoother than it was before I used it and it does appear to be more hydrated (considering I am in Florida  that is a strong plus). However  for the money  I could buy Ahave products for exfoliating and get the same or better results (and much less a cost). As I do not have major creping issues  I cannot say whether this products works (which may justify the cost)  but for my needs it is an excellent exfoliator and I know I could do better price wise for same,1
vinegar or lemon juice to clean it,"Mixed blessing  but so far  so good. I looked at probably 20 portable ice makers before choosing this one. Price was a factor  but so was customer input from reviews. It seemed like many of the other models were the exact same machine with a different company label stuck on them  and their reviews were so varied  it seemed like you either got a lemon or a good one.  Also  all the others opened at the top and vented on the side. For some reason  I thought this one would work better in our area  with the drawer pulling out at the front  and I THOUGHT the vent would be at the side like all the other machines.  My purpose in buying this is not for a bar or camper  like many people. I am partially disabled  and can't get downstairs to the kitchen on any sort of regular basis. I really wanted to be able to have ice when I wanted some  especially with the heat of summer rolling in very  very soon. I don't like room temperature drinks  esp water or tea  so I'd found myself drinking Pepsi almost exclusively  the only thing I could stand at room temp. That needed to stop!  So  I ended up buying this one  but the experience was not a pleasant one. I love my Amazon prime dearly  but they really botched this one. The shipping dates got moved around even after I paid extra for one-day shipping  and ended up with this being delivered on a totally different day  when I was the only one home and could not come to the door. (Note that Amazon did end up giving me a small credit on my acct to try to make up for the shipping problem  even though it did not solve my problem.) I always chat with the UPS guys through the upstairs window  so they left it for me anyway. I knew my son would be home very shortly after  and he was. He brought the box up  and I have to say that I am almost positive I got a customer return. The box looked like it had previous shipping labels peeled off of it. The box was beat up  torn  and had a crushed in spot on the side. Our UPS guys are really great  so I think it was shipped out from Day One looking like that - who in the warehouses think customers really want something that looks that bad?! (And yes  I know this is a product review section  and I can file shipping problems elsewhere  and I will. Just giving folks a heads-up of how it is shipped and what I received.) This is shipped in its original mfg box with tie cords on it  there is no other packaging other than what the mfg sends it out with - no Amazon packaging whatsoever. Strike One.  I opened the box  not sure of what I would find. It only has two big strips of styrofoam on the sides to hold it. Ours indeed had a dent in the side  and one of the back exhaust fans had cracked plastic. Not a crisis  but at this price  I really do expect a brand new item in great condition! Strike Two.  SMELLS/TASTE: I read a lot of reviews that talk about the plastic smell and/or taste in the cubes  and how it didn't seem to want to fire up well. IF someone reads the directions (not everyone likes to do that!)  you'd see it says to make sure the machine sits for at least an hour to allow the coolant to properly settle back into place after you unpack it. This particular model also says to run a bleach solution through it to help clean it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT!! The machine indeed smells heavily of plastic. Anyone who has had a relay switch burn out on an item knows what smell I am talking about - sort of like melting plastic. Ugh. However  having read plenty about portable ice makers before buying one  I knew that either vinegar or lemon juice would also work just fine. I chose to go with one that was ingestible  rather than bleach!! We did the lemon juice  and ran an entire cycle of cubes through it with the lemon/water. (Toss the ice please!) I then ran two loads (all the cubes a full water tank would make) through it of plain water. AFTER those cycles  I wiped it out again and ran regular water through it to try making cubes we'd use. We had no problems at all with any funny tastes in our ice this way. If you have a bad quality of tap water though  I'd suggest using either bottled  filtered or distilled water. It is only natural that your cubes will not taste better than your tap water. Ours is okay  so we're good that way. I would have bought a water filter (like a Brita) if that had not been the case. No lemony taste  no plastic taste  no gross tastes or odors at all. (Remember  I really do NOT recommend using bleach like the mfg suggests. While I understand the germ-killing properties of the bleach  I really don't want to ingest any of it. I would also think it would be much more caustic to the plastic parts and hoses of the machine  wearing them out sooner. Stick with lemon juice.) It did smell like plastic out the exhaust fan for quite a while  but it is fading away.  NOISE: Of course it is going to make noise. This has a compressor  and it will be making some noise. However  I've found that at its noisiest part of the cycle  it is no different than a microwave oven running  sometimes a little quieter.The ice cubes dumping make me jump a little bit  at least at first  but then again I am easily startled. Made the cats jump too! LOL! However  they are pretty much used to it now  even if they eyeball it suspiciously while it is running.  I have to say that I haven't stopped to time an actual cycle to make the ice. I've tried the small  medium and large cubes though. They are all gumdrop-shaped (or like the Dots candy at the movies)  with a hole in the middle of the bottom. It didn't seem to take very long though. The small ones were a little too small for my uses  but would be good for smaller drink glasses. I use a [[ASIN:B003X46LHG Bubba Brands Keg 52 Oz Mug Slate Gray]] to hold the ice at the moment  and love it. If you use the medium size  you can get the first batch in around 10 minutes  but the other batches do seem to take longer for some reason. It has also seemed to get ""stuck"" where it runs and runs  with nothing going on. I turn it off  let it sit a minute and push start again  and off it goes. I am not sure if it is just my machine with the dents from rough handling  or if all of this model is like that.  I was disappointed that this unit does not exhaust on the side  reason being where I planned to locate it  on a table behind my bed! It would vent towards my pillow  which is just not gonna happen. So  I have it turned sideways so it will vent towards the doorway. It makes opening the ice drawer more awkward  and makes me wish I'd tried one of the top-opening models now. There wasn't anything in the photos and such to suggest that this unit would be different than most of the other portable ice makers. It is. I'll post photos at a later date.  This model's book also suggests plugging the machine in to a GFI outlet  or grounded plug that will shut off if it senses dampness. I don't have one in the bedroom  and currently am using a heavy-duty  three-prong extension cord and plugging it in in the bathroom  where we do have a GFI plug. Not ideal  but better than trying to get a special outlet installed in a rented bedroom.  The scoop is VERY tiny. It works best to scoop towards you  so you don't send ice cubes back into the machine. The measuring cup works well for pouring  because you have a small reservoir to fill  and you have to go over a small clear rubber ""wall"" that helps to hold the drawer in place and hold temperatures.  Any unused ice does indeed melt back into the reservoir and is recycled back into cubes. Once I have enough ice for anyone who wants it  I turn it off rather than let it continually cycle. I also unplug it in the evenings when I go to bed for the night  since I'm the only one who can't go downstairs for ice if they want it. I hope that saves on the ""vampire electricity"" of the unit. Note that this is not a refrigerated ice maker  and the unused ice WILL melt. Many people complained about ice cubes stuck together - I've only experienced that when getting ice that has been done for an hour or so (it keeps the ice for at least an hour after the last cycle at this point) - otherwise  the cubes are all loose and easy to use. If you try to take the ice drawer all the way out after leaving the ice sit for a while  it WILL leak water on you - the water is simply the ice melting back and going through the drain holes that let it run back into the reservoir. (Nope - I didn't even think about the drainage holes when I pulled the drawer out the first time  and had water on the table and the floor. That was my fault though.)  For now  I am mostly happy with it. I cannot tell you how nice it is to have ice when I want it  instead of waiting for someone to get home in the evening and get me some! It was an expensive luxury though  and one I really thought long and hard about getting since I can no longer work. I'm thinking I really want to keep it. The cosmetic issues were VERY annoying  since I paid for a new machine  not a used one  but in this case  I blame Amazon for sending this out with a crushed box from the get-go. I would not have accepted it  had I been able to get to the door and saw it. Again - for some reason  this was the most problematic purchase I've ever had in all my time on Amazon.  This machine has not reached Strike Three yet  but you can be sure I'll come back and update my review should that happen. For now  I'll keep running it  and see how it seems to work  dents  cracked exhaust grid and all. (The dents are even more annoying  because it has a stainless steel appearance. It shows readily. It was more of a hassle to return it than to just keep it  as long as it continues to work.)  UPDATE June 29  2012: Well  I've had this machine for a little over a month now. Is it perfect? Nope. Does it make ice? Yep. Does it make a little noise?  Yep  but not unbearable. So far  the broken parts do not seem to be affecting the basic function of the machine. While I still have not literally timed the cube cycle (I have good intentions  but seems like there's always something better to do than watch the clock for ice cubes to drop! Ha!)  I have found the medium cubes to be the most useful. In fact  I often use an empty Sobe Lifewater bottle to make quick tea (loving the new tea from Lipton with the honey in it)  and the medium cubes fit in this bottle perfectly. So  that might give folks a better idea about the size of the medium cube. The difference in the sizes are basically more (or less) layers of ice on the cubes. The small ones are still too big for a basic 16.9 oz water bottle  and melt too fast when I shake up my tea. The first batch of the day takes around 10 minutes  but for some reason  they are skinnier than the normal mediums. The machine makes additional batches inbetween 10-15 minutes. Around 2 or 2-1/2 of the water cup it comes with to fill the reservoir to maximum. That will fill the ice bin to the top with medium cubes.  At this point  I increased my stars by one  because of the function of the machine  and it being willing to do what I ""hired"" it to do - keep me in cold drinks. Strike three has not yet happened  and I hope it doesn't! Enjoy!",0
break,Good but.... I know it is a pipette but it is just too narrow for what I needed.  Do be careful as they are glass and can break.,0
not what is shown on the picture,hate it.. Unlike the picture this thing is about the size of a quarter and broke the first time I used it. Don't bother getting it. It is not what is shown on the picture and it was only one tiny  tiny thing that never worked. Waste of money.,0
lightweight,I love this! It's lightweight so baby doesn't get too .... I love this!  It's lightweight so baby doesn't get too hot  but it also keep the sun and wind off of baby.  It also helps keep people from touching the baby.  Too many germs around these days!,1
offers like five or six products,Full & trial sizes premium beauty products. I like this subscription box because it offers full sized skin care and make up products and they are premium beauty products. However  I do not like the fact that the box does not offer very many products it only offers like five or six and I feel like it’s over priced. I suggest the ipsy subscription that offers make up skin care and products for your body and they come in full and trial sizes and that has been a great subscription box for me.,0

meanings for adults and kids,one of my favs. This is one of my personal favorite Disney flicks.  As usual  Disney tells a great story with meanings for adults and kids alike  but this one is especially good.  I just think it's a great movie for anyone to see.  Dare you not to feel anything or not to cry.  I know that movie reviews are subjective  and this is just my opinion.  Good for all ages in my opinion.,1

future shipments will include items we already have or have done,"STEM subscription for homeschool kiddo. I homeschool our 6yo grandson and wanted a STEM or STEAM subscription service to introduce into our curriculum.  Researched several and opted for the Amazon service for multiple reasons (namely price and returns). Subscribed to the 8-13 level because it seemed he had already done a lot of the experiments listed in the description for 5-7yo category. Definitely challenging and will last quite awhile. First shipment was the Lasers  which I was looking at buying anyway - glad I did not because it was cheaper thru the subscription service.  Do wish Amazon would alert buyer to what's next in the service though - give an ""opt out"" to that months shipment. I anticipate some of the future shipments will include items we already have or have done and I will need to return as a result. I only get an email 1 day prior to delivery letting me know what's coming.",0

ads to buy tokens,TOO tight. Up side.... 1.not a lot of ads... except to buy tokens Down side.... 1. SUPER tight payouts... (cause they want you to buy tokens  right?) but that makes you less likely to play 2.  Once a day &#34gift&#34 tokens... VERY small - most of the time used in 2 spins 3.  They bring in new games and then take them away... so far  the really fun games! 4.  A bunch of &#34high roller&#34 games that are ridiculous to play unless you buy millions of tokens  so they are a waste 5.  Even after &#34buying&#34 tokens they STILL don't pay out any better and STILL accost you with ads to buy more tokens. 6.  The worst part is that in order to make an &#34account&#34 so you don't loose you purchased tokens you MUST allow them access to your facebook!!! You would think if you'd purchased tokens you could set up using an email.. I got the msg after trying to set up with my gmail  &#34We are currently not allowing account setups with gmail.&#34  - or any other email. So I guess when I run out of the tokens I bought I will just uninstall. BEWARE of &#34unhelpful&#34 votes as they are likely the seller that doesn't like that you are providing honest reviews.,0
egg and cheese dishes,"Note: This is the US version / reprint of ""Curry Easy Vegetarian"". Earlier this summer  I ordered the excellent &#34[[ASIN:0091949475 Curry Easy Vegetarian]] from the UK as I adore Madhur Jaffrey (and vegetarian Indian cookbooks in general  especially the two fantastic Gujarati cookbooks by [[ASIN:1444734717 Prashad Cookbook: Indian Vegetarian Cooking]]. True to form  this is an excellent  informative guide to vegetarian cooking across India that includes over 200 recipes for vegetables (roasted  stir-fried  curry)  dals  grains (pilaf  flattened rice  upmas)  breads and pancakes  numerous delicious egg and cheese dishes  chutneys  and drinks  sweets and desserts. From what I can tell  &#34Vegetarian India&#34 appears to be identical (as referenced in the book's title page) but in US measurements  so if you already own &#34Curry Easy Vegetarian &#34 you will be getting the exact same recipes. This is a lovely  user-friendly introduction to vegetarian Indian cuisine highly recommended.",1

Animal Crossing Vibe,Animal Crossing Vibe. This cat island puzzle has an Animal Crossing vibe to it. The image is fun and colorful  plus it has lots of cats! The pieces are a good size and cut well. I didn't notice any puzzle dust. I did not care for the company logo being on the back of every piece. That actually made it a little more difficult to sort because you had to look at both sides to make sure you were putting the right side up. It doesn't come with a poster of the image either. I really appreciate that addition to puzzles. It's a pain to have to hold the box in your hand just so you can see where things go. The full image is on the bottom of the box. The lid has a blown up picture that doesn't show everything. Plus  the brand logo is on both of the images. They really are pushing their logo on us!! They do include a business card size picture of the puzzle but that's really impossible to use because it's so small.,1
fabric shaver gets most pills / fuzz from your clothes,Excellent. This is an excellent fabric shaver.  Originally I purchased the [[ASIN:B0014UGDQA Evercare Giant Fabric Shaver 1 ea]] but that worked awful. I also tried [[ASIN:B001OXZB06 D-Fuzz-It DFuzzIt Sweater & Fabric Comb - Oak Hill Industries #DFUZ]] which was good but hard to clean the fuzz from.  However  this fabric shaver gets most pills / fuzz from your clothes.  Just lay the clothing out flat on a flat and stable surface and gently move it over the fabric.  My only complaint is that the lint tray is way too small for all the fuzz it will remove that you have to constantly empty it. Other than this it's a great purchase and is available for $9.99 at some Bed  Bath  and Beyond stores.  This unit takes two C size batteries  comes with a special ring for delicate fabrics  has a cover for when not in use  and comes with a lint brush to clean the cutting blades.  It is also easy to disassemble for cleaning.,1
true to description,Smooth. The rocks in this set are small  but true to what the description states. They are smooth and mostly flat. I didn't count them to make sure that I received 100  but I don't need an exact count  so that's okay if it's not exactly 100.,1

super quick acting relief,Great tasting  super quick acting relief!. I love Soundhealth products and these antacid chews are some of the best. First  forgetting the fact that they are a great antacid product  quickly relieving heartburn  they are also great tasting with no chalky aftertaste (like Tums). Then  to make it even sweeter  they are even less expensive then my regular antacid I get at CVS. I am sold on these chews and will never go back to other products again!,1

smart idea,Space savers. 1st of all I love the fact that these are acrylic And not glass. I really don't like using glass in picture frames because they break if they fall off the wall or if someone knocks them over on the table.

detailed handles fit correctly in the palm of your hand,Can't buy a better set of cookware anywhere!. Let me begin by saying I love Circulon cookware. My kitchen is a walking advertisement for it. It is designed for the cook  from the detailed handles that fit correctly in the palm of your hand to the way the pots clean up beautifully. I have never had a problem with the non-stick cookware peeling or pitting or scratching in anyway (unlike the Calphalon I have had in the past). Now specific to this set: This is the perfect housewarming or shower present for the bride to be. This set will last for years and will make even the most novice chef appear to be a professional on the first try out. There is every size in the set (perhaps with the exception of a really large stock pot) which a chef could ever need. Last weekend  I actually used almost the whole set simultaneously cooking an Italian dinner for my extended family  and I can assure you the set was well used  scraped and stirred for several courses. After the set was washed   it looked like I just took it out of the box. Circulon may be a little more pricey than some lower cost manufacturers. But it's the old adage  you get what you pay for. Circulon is simply the best!,1
Good protectors,Good protectors.. They're nice but too big for the standard size carrying cases that you can find everywhere. I had to purchase the soft ones for my son to be able to fit them in the case. These he uses for the special ones that stay home. Good quality product however.,1
essential oil,LOTS OF ALLERGIES AND BEST Essential Oils I Ever Bought.. I bought this set last June and just opened it now. The fact that the oils are SO fresh upon opening nine months later says a lot.  A few things you have to understand:  The negative review about allergy upon skin contact is only ONE case. As someone with a ton of skin sensitivities and contact dermatitis  I also got a tiny bit itchy with mixing the orange  lemongrass and rosemary onto my skin but THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO THAT. These are 100% essential oil  NOT mixed with any kind of carrier. If you go to Whole Foods and buy one of the AuraCacia oils  many are mixed with jojoba oil so that they are easier on skin. Yes  they also have a line of 100% essential oils but these are a much better value. These are FULL POTENCY and VOLATILE which means yes  they *can* burn skin and SHOULD NOT be used on or around pets (do research as I know some oils are poisonous to cats). Any full potency oil can be extremely toxic to children if ingested. If you are making a batch of homemade lotion  DIY sanitizers or whatever else  you add like 4-5 drops for every CUP of product. More than that is going to be way too much. That said  this is actually a REALLY great value for this entire set. And non-GMO  Organic?!!! AMAZING.,1

glorious,Softest hands ever  lightly scented w/ lemongrass oil  lemon oil  orange oil  rosemary. I love Leap bar soaps (LOVE!)  and was curious about their liquid hand soap. It is a 12 ounce pump style bottle with visually pleasing label. The soap comes out thick and rich. It is super luxurious feeling- it lathers significantly all the while feeling like hand cream. It rinses well and leaves skin feeling soft. Probably the most soft. Perhaps a little coating of glycerin and aloe are left behind? Yet not a gross coating.  I am trying to figure out the magic of my soft  smooth  clean feeling hands on a super cold (18*F)  dry day. Super moisturizing.  Oddly  I find it has barely any scent. I am used to their super scented bar soaps  and I was expecting a stronger scent to come through. I am not usually keen on perfume (causes headaches  nausea)  but when a product uses essential oils for scenting (especially hand soap and house cleaners)  I find it delightfully uplifting. This is labeled as lemongrass  but that isn't the only essential oil used. The profile is more complex with the addition of lemon oil  orange oil  and rosemary. I was really excited for this to have a robust citrus smell. I really couldn't tell you just by sniffing. It smells fresh and clean  but it isn't strong (and I was hoping/expecting strong). I see other reviewers mentioning a strong smell. I figured I got a weird bottle or I have covid. I actually went and grabbed my Leap bar soap to make sure I could still smell that. I can. Phew.  I'm still going 5 stars because it does have a mild fresh scent  and the soap itself is glorious. Very rich  super moisturizing lather. And it rinses away perfectly. I dont feel like I am working to get the soap off. If it did  I wouldn't like that. So there is some sorcery involved here  lol. I kinda want it as a body wash. My hands feel SO GOOD after using this. I just keep touching my hands.  One does not need a lot of soap  so feel free to just add a little to the hand. I would even go so far as to add a little water as it goes down. Or if you like this soap and have a foamer  then just a wee bit of this with a lot of water will do it.  Love their designs on the bottles.  Water  Organic Coconut Oil  Organic Olive Oil  Vegetable Glycerin  Organic Guar Gum  Lemongrass Oil  Orange Oil  Organic Jojoba Oil  Lemon Oil  Rosemary Extract  Organic Aloe Vera (Potassium Hydroxide is used to saponify the organic oils into soap  but none remains in the final product),1

awful controls,Excercise in Frustration. Consider this game an Excercise in Frustration.  Awful controls make for nearly impossible tasks (not good for 5-7 year olds) I find it interesting that this game might only appeal to the very young &lt 5 and yet the game requires lots of READING? So the parents get dragged in to help out and the game is torture for adults. Mind numbingly boring and complete frustration on impossible tasks. I about thru the controller at the TV (not good when playing with my son)  PS This game is not at all like the other My Sims games and not free-roaming or free building. It's essentially a bunch of impossible puzzles for 5 year olds (that requires adults to try and help)  STAY AWAY !!,0
graphic violence,A quick read  but a disjointed and lightweight plot. Dead and Gone  the ninth installment in Charlaine Harris's Southern Vampire series  is both a curse and a blessing. Let's start with the good news first: the blessing is that it's a quick  breezy read (I finished it in a couple of hours). The curse is that the plot is lightweight  many of the characters are throwaway  and the book reaches a new level of graphic violence on par with HBO's [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]] adaptation.  As I've noted in the most recent Southern Vampire novels  Sookie is starting to show her age. She's currently without a love life she's sworn off Bill after discovering his treachery  she broke off her relationship with weretiger Quinn  and Eric seems to want to claim her for her own (finally  we get some more Eric action!).  In Dead and Gone  Sookie is once again called upon to discover the perpetrator of a gruesome crime when one of her shifter acquaintances is found brutally murdered behind Merlotte's. Like the vampires before them  the Weres have also decided to go mainstream  and this may be the reason behind the death. There's also a secondary plot involving Sookie's fairy connections through her great-grandfather Niall  and of a brewing war between rival fairy factions that threatens Sookie and everyone that she loves.  The main problem with Dead and Gone is that little time is given to what is supposed to be a central theme. Sure  Sookie's fairy heritage has been revealed in bits and pieces over several books  but in Dead and Gone  this plays a central role yet little is revealed about Harris's fairy culture other than the fact that Sookie is constantly in danger. Regarding the level of violence  the bodies pile up with little rhyme or reason characters that have been present in several books are handily dispatched for no apparent reason other than to generate  collateral damage. Several pregnant women are murdered. There are also graphic depictions of crucifixion and torture that may be disturbing to some readers.  The narrative is disjointed and contains numerous errors regarding events in earlier books. The biggest flaw is the lack of interest too much time is spent on the initial murder while the real battle is anticlimactic. The numerous red herrings (Octavia discovering a long-lost flame and moving out  former friend Arlene's betrayal that nearly results in Sookie's demise  Quinn's single appearance  Sookie mentioning her nephew Hunter only twice) only serve to fill pages and do nothing to advance the backstory or the action. Dead and Gone isn't a total loss  but it's not an engrossing read either  more of a beach book that's good for summer afternoons. Yes  it reads quickly  but I felt like precious little had actually occurred in 300 pages. I can only hope that the next installment sees a deeper story and more character development.,0
age appropriate activities,A great magazine for teachers and little kids. Ladybug is full of useful resources for early childhood teachers and the material is useful even if the magazines are out of date. The ideas in the magazines can be modified for use in the classroom. I teach children from kindergarten to year three  so I need a wide range of suitable materials. Since I am also a parent  I really enjoyed borrowing the magazines for my daughter when she was small. She loved the magazines and when she grew out of them  she graduated to 'Cricket' which is the magazine that follows on from 'Ladybug'.Since 'Ladybug' contains lots of activities  stories and songs  it doesn't take long to build up a useful library of resources. What's more! The activities are age appropriate and they all work.,1
true to size,Cute and Comfortable!. First  the picture of this doesn't look like the actual bra. If you look at the other pictures in the description  it shows the real one. It's all one color of brown. The picture shown makes it look like it has two distinctly different colors. I would say it's true to size. While it is a full coverage bra  it's very thin so I can't wear it under just anything. The lace will show through lighter  form fitting fabrics. When wearing form fitting shirts  I really have to wear t-shirt bras or molded cups  for nipple coverage as well. It's a comfortable enough bra to wear all day long. It's cute  too!,1
tone is very dead and slappy with felt beater,Ew. Very thick and heavy. And the adhesive is a joke. Adds a ton of mass to batter head  killing resonance.....and not in a good way. The tone is very dead and slappy with felt beater. YMMV,0
on the wider side,Cheaply made  loose threads  thin & scratchy. Title says it all  really. It's thin  it's a very loose knit  there are loose threads everywhere... it's on the wider side so it won't stay up over your nose or keep your neck warm  although wearing it as a hood  around your head   or as balakava is ok. It's more expensive than and less nice than similar products from other brands. Washing it did make it a bit softer  but I have no idea how a reputable brand that is so popular can also be so cheap and poorly made.,0
actors were excellent,All the actors were excellent. Scenery is very beautiful but almost the entire .... Really enjoyable movie!  All the actors were excellent.  Scenery is very beautiful but almost the entire movie takes place in one village.  I thoroughly enjoyed The Hundred Foot Journey as I have all of Lasse Halstrom's movies!,1
light blanket not held up,Good idea  not at all sturdy. This is not sturdy. Falls apart way too easily. A light blanket is not even able to be held up with it. Any little bump breaks it apart. Such a great idea  but needs to be much stronger to function.,0
clips,Great Set!. A few weeks ago  my children and I started crafting with resin. One of our friends saw our initial pieces and requested an initial. Well  we needed a new mold then! This is a great mold that has all of the letters A-Z and digits 0-9. The molds aren't too shallow so the finished letters are a good thickness. The set also comes with some fun accessories such as the tassels and key rings. There's also some glitter and a tool for putting the holes in to the finished letters. I ended up ordering some different key rings  because I wanted clips so we could clip our initials to our bags if we wanted. Overall  this is a fun set to have.,1
sturdy enough to type on,I use mine as a percussion stand. I've purchased a few of these from different brands. Although the design is fairly generic some are better than others. This one is sturdier than the last one I purchased from a different brand  but for what I use it sturdiness not not so much a factor. I have mine set up near my drums with maracas  claves  and the such. No problem there. I did test it with my Levovo T400 laptop and it was sturdy enough to type on  but the 'mouse extension' was pretty useless. Of course I didn't purchase it for that feature.  The included bag is more functional than the bags that come with some of my other stands  so that's a plus. A word about having multiple stands: I have one in my rehearsal studio  another in al alternate studio  and one on my vehicle for when I am performing live. Of the three - all in this price range - this is my favorite.  If you are planning to use a heavy projector  you may want to move to the next higher tier of stands. I am not sure that this one will meet your needs. If you are a musician  though  this is perfect for hand percussion instruments  probably mouthpieces and the such  or a place for other small tools and instruments.,1
not flattering to anybody type,Cheap cheap cheap cheap material. This does not look as full and vibrant as the picture! This is poorly constructed and entirely not flattering to anybody type! The material is so thin that you can see right through it and the feel of it just makes you break out in a rash just by looking at it before you even put it on. This is grotesque and if you cannot pronounce the name of the company you should not buy!,0
not for cooking,handy and so easy to use. I have IBS and my gastro doc has instructed me to do the FODMAP diet for 8 weeks.  Very  very frustrating diet.  So much you cannot eat that seems strange.  One thing is garlic.  Used in pretty much EVERYTHING you buy.  However  you ARE allowed to use garlic &#34infused&#34 oil... So  I decided to try this to help with the lack of salad dressing and on other foods.  I actually carry it in my purse because I eat out fairly often.  So I ask for some balsamic vinegar and use a couple of sprays of this garlic infused oil.  Quite tasty and easy.  So... you can make your own garlic infused oil  but it will only keep for about 1 week according to the recipe.  I wanted something less smelly to make (the smell will last in your kitchen for days making your own)  and something that would last a bit longer.  This oil is NOT for cooking... it is a &#34finishing&#34 spray... meaning you put it on food AFTER it is cooked or on salad or other cooked/raw foods. Taste is very personal  however  for me  it has a very strong garlic flavor.  Not overly so  but definitely there. It is satisfying.  Honestly  I may keep using it after my weird FODMAP diet days are over.  I was not able to find this anywhere locally so I am once again thankful to Amazon for bringing the world to my front door.  I always update with any useful info if that comes up.,1
Portrait of Jennie is a pretty decent love story.,"Fans of Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Somewhere in Time will adore Portrait of Jennie. Jennifer Jones ([[ASIN:B00008LDO7 The Song of Bernadette]]) and Joseph Cotten star in Portrait of Jennie  a 1948 film that revolved around a painter's obsession with a beautiful  mysterious girl who seems to live more in the past than the present. Eben Adams (Cotten) is a washed-up painter on hard times and lacks inspiration until he meets Jennie (Jones) in a New York park. Jennie has an unusual way of speaking about past events as though they are current (referring to Germany's kaiser  and to theaters that had been demolished). Her fresh-faced beauty appeals to Adams  and Jennie makes the wish that he wait for her to grow up so that they can be together.  Jennie's sporadic appearances allow time for Eben to work on other commissions  and to research Jennie more carefully by interviewing people who had worked with her parents (famous high-wire circus performers). Inevitably  dark truths are uncovered that disturb Eben's ""painting-perfect"" romance with the soft-spoken  beautiful Jennie. His portrait of her is a testament to his love and brings him artistic fame. Eben is also introduced to Miss Spinney (Ethel Barrymore)  a headstrong old maid who deals in paintings and who wants to see Eben produce something more spiritual. Other notable names include Lillian Gish as Mother Mary of Mercy  Cecil Kellaway as Matthews  and a young Nancy Davis Reagan in the art gallery.  Joseph Cotten is an engaging narrator  and his growing dependence on Jennie and his depression over Jennie's long absences is utterly believable (if a bit melodramatic). Jennifer Jones has more to work with here than in her first Oscar-winning role as Bernadette  although seeing a well-proportioned twentysomething trying to portray prepubescent innocence was a little bit creepy (see: Judy Garland in [[ASIN:B000ADS63K The Wizard of Oz (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]). Her character ages rapidly both physically and psychologically  so Jones was able to display a range of emotions  from a childhood crush to deeper musings on the nature of love and faith. Some of the secondary characters suffer from disappearing Irish accents others shamelessly (sometimes woodenly) overact.  The film follows several conventions of its time  and appears dated. The ""special effects"" are pretty standard several scale models are used and a green tint is used for the final scenes. There are some beautifully dreamy shots of New York City  and the fabulous effect of having shots appear as though they were painted on canvas. The DVD transfer features some artifacts and print flaws. There are no extras to speak of. However  fans of time-travel romances [[ASIN:B000083C6R The Ghost and Mrs. Muir]]and [[ASIN:B00004W46I Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)]] will enjoy Portrait of Jennie  although the strongest film of this genre is undoubtedly The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. Despite its shortcomings  Portrait of Jennie is a pretty decent love story.",1

cute puppies,Little Me Baby Boys' Cute Puppies. These are so cute and fit well  she loved these as they were a shower gift.,1
easy to listen to,One Eskimo. I really enjoyed this CD I thought it was easy to listen to. I loved the beat of the music and found the words very thought provoking. I also found it very relaxing and music I could listen to over and over again.,1
loaded the foil and press and seal into the box,Works well  but needs instructions. There were no instructions  The rod doesn't seem to fit anywhere  so I'm not sure where it goes. We loaded the foil and press and seal into the box. Added the zippers and it cuts wonderfully. I like it and would buy another if needed. I never cut these things straight with the box. This is easy to work.,1
wired ribbon,Reusable christmas boxes. These are flatter reusable christmas boxes with magnetic flaps.  They are sturdy and pretty.  We reuse them for years - these look like they will last - but time will tell!  We use wired ribbon and reuse it too.   Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - nearly 6 000 reviews posted  viewed over 50 000 times  and over 24 000 likes. I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,1
clumps very well easy to clean,Cat's Pride Fresh Scent Pure & Fresh Multi-Cat Clumping Litter  10-Pound Jug. Very very fine in size and texture  smell's good and wells well in on controlling order  also clumps very well easy to clean  I bought it at a great price!,1
one time use,Light Floral Scent. This fragrance has a light floral scent. I normally don't like floral scents  but this one is pleasant. The petals are a great way to try out scents. The towelettes are basically one time use. They're not wet and overly saturated  but they do transfer the fragrance to wherever you wipe them. These are perfect for traveling! I'm putting  a few of these in my 19 year old daughter's stocking this Christmas!,1
come so quickly,These make great gifts!. Love these and they come so quickly!,1
needle conveniently stores in the handle,Good basketball pump. Good pump and got it at a great price. It does the job and pumps up balls.  The needle conveniently stores in the handle which is great. It also comes with an attachment to blow balloons up too!,1
hair looks smooth and shiny,Great straightener for all hair types!. This is a great flat iron. I have been using irons for many years now as I love to keep my naturally wavy hair as a straightening mechanism. This Hot Tools iron is really nice. It feels well in my hand  is relatively light weight and is easy to maneuver all around my hair. And my hair looks so smooth and shiny! The iron heats up quickly and evenly and makes my hair styling go relatively fast. I also love the white and gold design  looks great on my bathroom counter. Highly recommend!,1
nostalgic walk down a snowy memory lane,"Retro-inspired country Christmas is a walk down memory lane.... ""The Farm Chicks Christmas"" by Serena Thompson is the follow-up to 2009's [[ASIN:1588168662 The Farm Chicks in the Kitchen: Live Well  Laugh Often  Cook Much]]. The first Farm Chicks book was a countrified cookbook peppered liberally with stories and reminiscences by Serena and Teri  antiques-inspired craft ideas (a reusable stencil was included in the front)  and comfort food: easy recipes for breakfast treats  appetizers  soups and salads  and decadent desserts  over fifty in all.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas "" on the other hand  is written only by Serena  a contributing editor for Country Living magazine and antiques show hostess (her best friend Teri has retired from their business). The book still includes numerous country-inspired craft ideas you'll find decorative  retro-inspired self-adhesive gift tags and notecards at the back  along with various decorating ideas for ""the most wonderful time of the year."" However  the ratio of crafts to recipes is reversed from the first book there are only 17 recipes included at the back with gift-giving suggestions on how to package them.  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" captures the magic of childhood Christmases  from family visits to the tree farm (complete with recipe ideas for hot drinks to tote along)  holiday decorating ideas (holiday scalloped bunting  vintage-inspired snowball pompom ornaments  cone trees and vintage funnel trees  banners and more)  and photos of Serena's friends' and family's homes decorated for Christmas.  Much of the book is more like a scrapbooked photo essay  with crafts sprinkled in every few pages. Also  the decorating tips (and included photos) are vintage country in the Farm Chicks fashion: displaying old farm toys standing in coconut snow  for example  or stacking metal funnels to make ""trees."" If you're not a fan of all things country  this probably isn't the holiday book for you.  The included holiday recipes are few  and aimed mostly at gift-giving  like the sweet and salty nuts  mini orange bundt cakes  and various types of cookies (butter cutouts  chocolate-covered peanut butter balls  snowballs  Spritz cookies). As with the previous book  a handy list of metric equivalent charts is provided at the back. I tried the sweet and salty nuts recipe first  and though tasty  I didn't think that the ""sweet"" flavor predominated it was more of a subtle afterthought (there's only 1.5 tablespoons of brown sugar and 2 teaspoons of honey for 3 cups of nuts).  Overall  ""Farm Chicks Christmas"" is a nostalgic walk down a snowy memory lane  but it has narrower mass appeal than ""Farm Chicks in the Kitchen"" due to the reversal of the recipe-to-crafts ratio and the genre-specific decorating style (I enjoyed the many beautiful photographs  but won't find myself making yarn-ball wreaths or filling jars with spare Christmas lightbulbs anytime soon).

New Yorker,"The Best (No Further Title Required). As a poet  there are a few places I'd love to be published. There's the New Yorker  the Atlantic  and Poetry Magazine. There are other places I want to see my work  but these three are  to me  huge. They vet the best poems  and publish them.  Only Poetry focuses on poetry. A review of their history would tell you they have tenure. Great poets are published here. Ones we all know  and ones we all should know. Unlike the New Yorker and the Atlantic  Poetry is especially open to unknowns. If you are good enough  you are in  whether you are famous or not.  Like most literary magazines  the design is clean  almost simple. Here  considering everything from paper color to typography  poems are more than printed: they are framed. No  no  no fancy design. Rather  they clear the way so that the poems are highlighted. Nothing but.  An essay and a few reviews finish each issue  followed by a couple pages of ads. All black and white.  If you are looking to buy a true literary magazine  as much curated as it is edited  pick this one. Don't do it to ""support the arts "" but because each issue is worth the time and money.  I fully recommend Poetry.  Anthony Trendl americanspeechwriter.com",1
electronic metronomes,Solid instrument that can help with not only time  but dynamics and listening skills. I received this as a free review sample. Since there are a number of very detailed reviews I am going to stick to how I use it as a drummer.  First  if you are practicing dynamics  this is an excellent tool. Of course it's designed to develop a sense of time  but it produces a beat in the 60 dB range at one meter. For a drummer this is somewhere in the P to PP range  so if you combine time keeping exercises with dynamics  this is an invaluable tool that I suspect most drummers will overlook because it's based on a design that is literally hundreds of years old. Trust me  this is effective. Moreover  since it is not incredibly loud it reinforces listening skills. I used this for a solid week in my practice room before writing this review and can make the claim that if you are a trained drummer this metronome has the potential to improve your dynamics  listening and time.  A nice thing is this is not as delicate as the old style metronomes upon which the design is based. It's not a toy and does need to be treated with care  but I owned a much older instrument that was temperamental and did not like being moved or handled much. This one is more robust.  Bottom line: if you are uncertain if this will be loud enough  download a copy of [[ASIN:B0054KJND6 Decibel-O-Meter Free]] and measure your own instrument's sound pressure level at one meter and determine if this metronome will be loud enough. For some instruments it may not be  but for many like an acoustic piano  guitar  etc. it will be. For folks like me this works for certain exercises like those I mentioned and it is a lot more pleasant than some of the electronic metronomes I have tried.,0
many compliments,Fabulous hat!. I have a smallish head and the inside drawstring is perfect for me. I get so many compliments when I wear it! I only wish it came in multiple colors! I was able to smash it up and put it in my suitcase without a problem and it bounced right back into its shape. It's well-made and looks more expensive than it is.,1
decent thickness,These bags are a decent thickness.  They add both sides together to get the 9.5 mil. Don't think the bag side is 9.5 mil thick.  It's a total of both sides when laying flat.  The bags are still of good quality.  They are a decent value at approximately 33 cents each.  I would buy these again.  Be careful with hard pointy items such as dehydrated carrots  they can poke through.,1
bike rides smooth,Easy to assemble  Bike rides smooth  display and fan not so good.. It is a little difficult to slide the seat into place but I think it's only because it's new. The display panel is too small and it's difficult to see it due to no back lighting. The fan is absolutely useless. Even when I lean into the fan  it doesn't blow my hair at all.  It's too high on the display and too weak.  The plug for the display is in the front of the bike  making it a trip hazard unless you want to face the wall while working out.  I had to tape mine to the bottom of the bike.  They should have passed the wire through the frame of the bike so that it could plug into the back.  The bike itself rides smoothly and is very quiet.  It would be nice to have the bells and whistles actually work correctly.,1
feet feel and look,Just like getting a spa pedicure at home!. I have extremely rough and dry heels and feet. I tend to get pedicures every 2-3 weeks and it seems like within a day or two of having one done  my feet are back to being rough. I wanted to try one of these home pedicure callous removers and this one is exceptional! I love how it makes my feet feel and look  and it is actually really neat that the built in vacuum helps keep my bathroom clean while using it. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a home pedicure tool!,1
Well worth the price I paid.,Great Conway Twitty CD!. Great CD with all of his big hits. Well worth the price I paid.,1
made out of tin,Pretty bright colors. These are very cute hummingbirds. They are made out of a tin But they are sturdy. I hung mine outside and they look nice especially when the sun shines on them.,1
marginal price for marginal quality set,PU case really smells brushes are okay two brush heads frayed. There are 14 brushes in this set. There are brushes for foundation  blush  eyeshadow  eye blending (fan brush)  etc. In fact  there are more brushes than I needed.   The one unique brush in this set (see photo) is the one that looks like a paint brush. This is perfect for cheek highlighting.  The bristles are relatively soft but not as soft as I expected. They feel pretty good against my skin but not great. Also  the heads have a slight odor. The PU brush case has a tremendous chemical odor and needs to be aired out a while.  This is a bargain basement travel set for someone who is starting their make-up journey. The current price of $11.19 comes to $.80 cents per brush. In this case one gets what they pay for it's a marginal price for a marginal quality set that is functional. ,1

achingly beautiful,"A must-have CD for an outstanding price. I first read about Daniel Taylor on the SchollSociety messageboards and Amazon.com and I was intrigued. A Canadian countertenor with a voice comparable to Andreas Scholl's? ...I couldn't resist. I took it along on a three-hour bus ride to Tadoussac  Québec.  As the mournful opening strains of Erbarme Dich commenced  the haunting  sweeping violins and viol carried me along the winding roads through the mountains. The sky was overcast  and as I heard Taylor's voice for the first time the sun came out. I was in Heaven beautiful vistas of mountains on one side  jagged cliffs plunging into the St. Laurent on the other and Daniel Taylor's voice in my ears. Erbarme Dich is deep  passionate  and so achingly beautiful. I am an avid lover of Bach but it was the first time I had heard anything from St. Matthew's Passion. I was more familiar with many of the other Dowland songs: Time Stands Still  Come Again  Flow My Tears  and I Saw My Lady Weep  all of which are present on Andreas Scholl's ""English Folksongs and Lute Songs.""  Daniel Taylor's voice is exquisite. Haunting. Ethereal. A creamy  lush  pure sound  more feminine than Scholl's tone  reminiscent of brilliant Japanese countertenor Yoshikazu Mera. As with Scholl  the effect sounds effortless and angelic. ""Daniel Taylor: Portrait"" is an excellent introduction to an amazing talent. Ten stars.",1
display up and down,Space savers. 1st of all I love the fact that these are acrylic And not glass. I really don't like using glass in picture frames because they break if they fall off the wall or if someone knocks them over on the table. You can display these Either up and down or sideways depending on the picture. They look nice next to each other in any pattern. Very smart idea.,1
game controls,A great game that brought back a lot of fond summer memories. I used to take riding lessons as a kid  and even now I can still remember the excitement of caring for and riding such wonderful horses. &quotHorse Illustrated: Championship Season&quot is as close to the real thing as you'll get: you get to groom  feed  tack and ride four different horses depending on skill level. On top of caring for your horse  you also have the option to watch several videos on equine care  first aid  and riding techniques. As if that wasn't enough  the game has a scavenger hunt and a trivia game as well. There are three different types of riding challenges: dressage  cross country and show jumping. There are four skill levels based on accumulated points (earned by completing the scavenger hunt  correct trivia answers  caring for and riding your horse. The courses become more difficult as you progress. The scenery is varied for each course and the music is pleasant enough. The four horses each have different strengths and personalities and respond a bit differently to each jump. There's even a commentator for all three challenges. The controls were easy to master and the highest difficulty level still eludes me  so there is plenty of learning curve and opportunity for replaying &quotChampionship Season.&quot The barn area was very well conceived--I could practically smell the hay and horse manure in the summer heat. The lounge area had a fridge  microwave  VCR and cupboards full of things to explore. The tack room had several saddles  bridles  and books to read  and in the feed room you get to sort out the exact amount of the proper feed (hay  corn  alfalfa) for your horse. You also clean stalls and water the horses. There are five stalls  the last occupied by a goat. Each horse has its own colour (Barney=red  Blaze=blue etc.) as do the stalls and bridles. This is a great game for kids (or adults!) who love horses and teaches some basics about horse anatomy and care  grooming (including how to braid manes and tails)  and stresses regular feedings and stall cleanings. Perfect for the child that begs for a horse...this teaches some degree of responsibility about how much work is involved in caring for a horse.,1
complete frustration,Excercise in Frustration. Consider this game an Excercise in Frustration.  Awful controls make for nearly impossible tasks (not good for 5-7 year olds) I find it interesting that this game might only appeal to the very young &lt 5 and yet the game requires lots of READING? So the parents get dragged in to help out and the game is torture for adults. Mind numbingly boring and complete frustration on impossible tasks. I about thru the controller at the TV (not good when playing with my son)  PS This game is not at all like the other My Sims games and not free-roaming or free building. It's essentially a bunch of impossible puzzles for 5 year olds (that requires adults to try and help)  STAY AWAY !!,0
fog looks unintentional,Ahhh. This is a decent fog machine however the fog only lasts for short bursts. I got it for our Halloween setup but the fog looks unintentional (if that makes sense). It would produce the fog  then the fog completely dissipates  then more fog.  If you used this as a set prop in a 12x12 room  it would likely work well. I did try a few different fog liquids and still no success. We ended up borrowing our neighbors and it worked well. Their machine looked similar to ours so I don’t know what occurred.  I think it works ok  just needs to be a very small area.,0
useful for keeping important papers,Very useful for keeping important papers.. Wish it was not so expensive. Very sturdy. Keeps my papers safe. Easy to store on book shelf.,1
appear well made,Kids love them. Great silicone plates for kids. Deep sections that hold a lot of food. Kids love them and enjoy an assortment of food with each meal. They appear well made and are easy to clean.,1
great price,A must-have for your earthquake kit!. These are great! I bought them for our earthquake kits and will buy more! In case there's a big one and aftershocks  have this handy in case of more falling objects. Great price as well. Took a few minutes to figure out the straps to put them together- then it was a breeze-  very happy with this purchase.,1

"magazine is my ""stop everything and read it on the day it arrives""","Ahhhh ... my favorite magazine. I'm not an archaeologist. If I was born redundantly wealthy I think that I might have been one.  Archaeology is my ""stop everything and read it on the day it arrives"" magazine. I've been a subscriber for years. I read EVERY article. As a reader of archaeology and paleontology tomes  this magazine is the adjunct to my selections of books to read. My wife and I have planned vacations around Archaeology's articles.  I've detoured business trips to take in a visit to several article sites.  During a cross country moving event 7 years ago  I let the subscription expire for lack of new address. Someone from Archaeology  not a telemarketer for sure  called me and said that I had been such a long term customer that they really wanted to know why I didn't renew ... was it something about the magazine quality? The voice on the other end was just so dang disappointed as she pleaded for feedback that it was stunning enough for me to remember 7 years later. The magazine must be read by a small but dedicated subscriber base and I think the magazine staff themselves makes the calls.  My only complaint is that it only prints every 2 months. If archaeology is among your interests  you would entertain your fancies with a subscription.",1
crappy book,Awful!. The only reason there is one star is bc I couldn't give zero. This was bought for a gift. It came very used looking and the sound doesn't work. Crappy book all around and I am too embarrassed to even give this as a gift!!!,0
recipes,Great magazine. I have been a long time subscriber to Living magazine  especially after I saw how much less expensive it is to purchase a subscription over purchasing the individual issues at the grocery store. The only con I can think of is that the Halloween and other specialty issues are not included with the subscription  but considering they are usually $9.99+ an issue  I guess that is to be expected. (Although I do think I would pay more for my subscription to ensure I received all Martha Living type &#34speciality&#34 issues as well  just a thought.)  I love the crafts  the recipes  and the gardening advice. Highly recommended magazine!,1
"stop the ""no heat"" issue when drying clothes","Super easy to install.  Exact OEM replacement. Perfect exact OEM replacement part.  Videos can be found on YouTube as far as how to replace.  This will extend the life of your unit and stop the ""no heat"" issue when drying your clothes.",1
NFL fan,Five Stars. Fun  crazy hat for game day! A must for any NFL fan!,1
favorite gift,my favorite gift i bought for me. Craftsmanship superb and love the fact its handmade.  I have lots of jewelry.  It sets in special boxes and beautiful containers.  This i want to wear all the time.  I just ordered the mustard seed pendant.  I also make my own jewlery.  Wish i had made it!,1
book is dumb,Not worth the $2.00. This book is dumb  maybe worth $0.50 certainly not $2.00 you could easily find this in a dollar store and prob even better  there are 4 cupcake pictures and a few stickers.. not sure what I was expecting but this was definitely a disappointment,0
came on sale,wife collection. Good songs  nice voices and a good mix. She likes a variety of music but after hearing them on my daughters iPhone my wife wanted the disc. came on sale so we popped for it.,1

Matt and Brook's story was just as amazing but different,Five well earned stars... I loved book one. Lissy and Luke's story captured my attention and I couldn't stop reading. I didn't think the second book of the series could be much better but.. it was. Matt and Brook's story was just as amazing but different. Matt and Brooklyn were friends for over two years because Brooklyn was afraid of losing her best friend. Matt patiently waited for the woman that he knew was the one. Although the plot read like a typical love story the execution was superb. The writing was complex  honest  factual and complete. I didn't have the urge to slam my kindle against the wall because of grammatical errors  piecemeal writing or undeveloped characters. This book is print worthy and if you're an e-book reader you should understand what that is... I would give up a section of my bookcase to a print copy of this series. I like this author and respect her writing style therefore I will be picking up book three. Recommended but start with Book 1.,1
easy cheap cover,For the cost it's nice  but not enough for me. Bought for my 2021 Silverado Z71. It was easy to install and worked well enough. It looks like a $150 cover though. I just couldn't put it on such a nice truck and feel okay about it. I ended up with something much higher quality. If you want an easy cheap cover though  this is a good choice.,1
super easy to apply,Excellent variety pack of shadows!. Nice variety pack of eyeshadows. I love the muted neutral colors  go perfect with almost anything I wear. Also like the fact that these would make an excellent gift as well with the packaging. Colors last a super long time. When I apply in the morning (super easy to apply)  it remains all day and comes off easily with my makeup wipes at night. Highly recommend!,1
warmth heat has made the pain minimize,This really works!. I have suffered from neck  shoulder and upper back pain for years now. I get massages and use massage guns to get relief  but it still exists. When I saw this device I was a little skeptical  but I started using it nightly while watching television. I set it up behind me and let the infrared lights do their work. After using this for about a month now  I can say I feel a difference. The warmth  heat has made the pain minimize and I feel great after using it for about 15-20 minutes. Afterwards  I use it on my face to help activate collagen (my spa uses a similar light on my face as well and my skin looks great). I highly recommend this device for anyone with pain (especially).,1
cuddle-bear,Very handsome bear!. Good cuddle-bear!,1
looking at them over and over again,3yo looks forward to his mail every month!. Got this for my 3yo son for Christmas and he looks forward to getting his magazine in the mail every month!  He can't really do a lot of the activities in it by himself  but we sit down and read it and do the activities together.  He especially likes the &#34Ricky&#34 stories every month. He keeps coming back and looking at them over and over again as we keep them on the bookshelves with his regular books.  Planning on keeping this subscription for a long time!,1
easy to reach all buttons,Fits perfectly. I love that I now have added protection for my watch and bought my husband one for his! Easy to reach all buttons and easy to charge. (I bought the clear one).,1
too big for my hands,Pretty good mouse  works well but not really good for smaller girl hands. This mouse is unfortunately too big for my hands.  I wear a small to medium in gloves in women's sizing.  I love the mouse but am finding it too uncomfortable to use and my wrist is starting to hurt.  On the hunt again for a mouse that fits my hands.,0
treats were absolutely delicious,Great treats. These were absolutely delicious! My wife and I finished them in a few days. I would highly recommend these for yourself or a gift!,1
fashion magazine,Second only to...... Harper's is easily my second favorite fashion magazine  second only to InStyle.  It is great and packed with great fashion.  It actually does have some good articles too that I thoroughly enjoy reading.  (The articles are MUCH better than the ones in Elle.)  If you can only get one sub  get InStyle.  If you can get two  get InStyle and Harper's Bazaar.  It is well-worth the money.,1
good for her,Another great Fancy Feast product!. My 12 year old finicky eater calico cat eats almost exclusively Fancy Feast products (wet and dry). Flavors are great  texture and size of the morsels are perfect for her. This chicken variety is one of her favorites and I keep her dish filled with it all the time (to eat when the urge hits). I have had no troubles with UTIs or anything else since she has been eating this. I love that I can give her a food that she loves that is good for her as well. Of course  this is not quite as good as boutique brand foods (health-wise) but she loves this and I am happy to give her what she will eat.,0
stay moist,Very helpful product. I use these to get myself extra clean after using the restroom. They work wonderfully  stay moist  and are decently priced.,1
Great Tea,Yummy. Great Tea  I just have too much other great tea to continue with the service,1
thick,Superb socks with extra cushioning stays in place while walking are also warm. I first bought a pair of these socks at REI for $27 and loved them. I wanted another color of the same sock so I purchased these. These socks are wonderful. They are slightly thick  sturdy  snug but not too tight  and feel fabulous on. They cushion my heel and bottom of foot and they do not move around like other socks  which helps prevent blisters. I walk a lot and these socks stay put even on a two-hour walk. I LOVE THEM.  One caveat  however. These socks must be an older model of the same sock that I purchased at REI. The reason I say that is because compared to the original sock I purchased  they are about two inches shorter. I then did some research and found a comparison chart for two of the same mountaineering socks by the same name. The only difference between the two models is that there's a slightly different fabric combination and it is not listed as quick drying.  To me both socks feel the same. I also ordered three more pairs. I now own five pairs of these socks and they are WONDERFUL! In fact  I love them so much that I ordered this [[ASIN:B01F47N7XK men's pair]] for my boyfriend. My boyfriend loves them as well. He wears them to bed.,1
tension between Auntie Poldi and hunky police detective Vito Montana,I greatly enjoyed Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions. As a huge fan of the inspector Montalbano series and other international detective stories  I greatly enjoyed Auntie Poldi and the Sicilian Lions.  The pacing keeps you on the edge of your seat  and  although some elements require you to seriously suspend credibility  overall this is a highly entertaining romp.  Beautiful Sicily is the real star here   and you’ll find plenty of romance and hijinks with the high-spirited German expat Auntie Poldi  who has a few tricks up her fashionable sleeve  and who has set her sights on hunky police detective Vito Montana  and the tension between the two simmers and sizzles for much of the book.  The daughter of a German police detective  Poldi possesses great instincts and a knack for sleuththing that has her trying to find a killer involved with the mafia.  I can’t wait to read more of her adventures in the second book Fruits of the Lord.,1
$10 is very good,Great set of dish washing gloves!. This gloves are perfect for dish washing or other household cleaning duties. They keep your hands protect nicely during all these duties we love so dearly  not. They are a good quality product that should stand up the test of time quite nicely  only time will tell. These gloves come with a cotton flocking that makes wearing them nice and comfortable and absorbs your sweat to some degree. Getting a pair of these for $10 is very good so I can recommend purchasing these for sure!,1
thin,Too expensive not long lasting too few items. Not worth the $. Some chews were hollow fake bully sticks.  4 packages with max 4 in each bag.  Fake bully sticks 3 thin real bully’s couple of ears and a couple thin curly things Will not buy products again Way to expensive!,0
Fast shipping was great,Works Great with my IPhone 13 & Magna Case!. This item works great with my IPhone 13 with Magna Case on it. Also charges my Apple watch & IPods all at the same time. No issues at all. Fast shipping was great! On of the best chargers I have owned.,1

cleaning tips,"Creative Recipe Ideas & Fun  Colorful Articles about Life. A real favorite in this magazine is the page of quotes  It is sure to bring a smile or teach you something about life. They also always have cleaning tips  health topics  diet and exercise solutions  true stories  beauty hints  inspirational articles  soul nourishing tips  recipes  recipes and more recipes  family/children  flowers  end of the magazine article to make you think about life  and gardening hints.  If you want to find a cover story fast  they have an ""on our cover"" section in the index. In Every Issue there is a shopper's guide and a recipe index.  The articles are helpful and in the March 2002 issue they had an article on how to be less stressed. They also had an article on PCOS which is apparently more common than we women think.  The beauty sections show you the newest fashion and you can decide if you want to adapt your style to the trends. Always seems rather chic.  Some of the recipes in the March 2002 issue included:  A luscious Lemon Coconut Pound Cake Coconut Macaroons Peanut Butter Oat Bars Baby Cheesecakes - really cute Banana Salsa French Oven Beef Stew Pasta with Shrimp  The recipes are not difficult and seem practical.  Even the advertising in this magazine is colorful and fun.  A Very ""American Gal"" type magazine. Nothing fancy  just real life.  ~The Rebecca Review",1
well written characters,"If I could give it twenty stars instead of five I would!. I finally got around to reading ""On a Falling Tide"" by the uber-talented Georgia Hill as it had been in my to-read pile for far too long and wow what a book! A haunting and original page-turner  this book had me hooked from start to finish. I love historical fiction and none more so than when it has a touch of the supernatural and a gothic romance feel to it. I have read many time-lapse books that other reviewers have called atmospheric but ""On a Falling Tide"" really takes that word to a whole new level! There is love  loss  and of course as with any great haunting read  plenty of madness  which I assure you as a reader  you will feel too. The characters of Charity  Matt  and Lydia are so well written that they are almost tangible  as is the wonderful fictional town of Beaumouth which is set on the very real and beautiful Jurrasic Coast in England (where I was lucky enough to be born and grow up next to). I just cannot say enough good things about this book and if I could give it twenty stars instead of five on Goodreads I would! I cannot wait to see what else Georgia has up her talented sleeve.",1
expect this cart to last a very long time,This cart will absolutely exceed your expectations!. This cart exceeded my expectations by 200% even at the $169 price tag.  It is designed to work hard and not break.  It’s built like a tank  I have no doubt about the 400 lb load rating. The larger wheels easily go up/down stairs and curbs.  I expect this cart to last a very long time.  One cool feature is that when the cart is closed and the wheels are folded up  if you hold it vertically  the wheels are slightly below the platform and roll.  This comes in handy if you don’t have any cargo and you’re have limited access  you can close the cart and roll it instead of carrying it.  You won’t be disappointed with this cart!,1
salty,salt and ving and spicy chile. I had not seen these in my local stores  but I LOVE sea salt and vinegar chips and spicy chile lime.. and I love peanuts.  they are DELICIOUS.  Tangy and salty.. and I think the Planters does the best tasting peanuts.  The vinegar is not super overwhelming... just a bit a tangy.  The salty part is light... I would say less salty than say a dry roasted peanut.  It's just a nice break from the usual.  The can is the small 6 oz size.. about 6 servings (1 oz) each at about 160 calories.  So  why is it 4 stars instead of 5... artificial flavoring (sea salt and vinegar)  &#34Sigh*.  Ingredients... peanuts  sea salt  peanut oil  sodium diacetate  dextrose  malic acid  maltodextrin  yeast extract  natural flavor  canola oil  salt  paprika  turmeric extract (color)  ascorbic acid.  I always try to avoid things I can't pronounce - I really do like the taste  but I will look for something without &#34artificial&#34 anything. Now... for the spicy chile lime... Oooooooo!  VERY spicy.  In fact  they are so spicy I don't taste any of the lime.  My husband loves super spicy so he loves them. I  never hesitate to update my reviews if new info would be useful and hope this info was helpful to you!,1
one of my cats chews them,turned out AOK after all. my cats sniffed them but didnt chew them ....  i unfortunately cant eat them to give a good review  LOL  I guess they will play with them  or ill throw them outside maybe the possums will eat them  UPDATE one of my cats chews them but she's young the older cat  chewed on one and a tooth fell out  LOL i sent a pack to my friend who has a LOT of cats and they are happy,0
dry crepey skin,Great way to scrub and exfoliate!. I have been using scrubs in the shower for the past few years. I have really dry  crepey skin and scrubs really help. I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw these cubes  couldn't figure out if I would be able to control it in the shower (trying to get it onto my legs and arms). I was pleasantly surprised  however  to see how easy it was.  As I begin to use it the cube stays in the palm of my hand and begins to 'melt' slowly as I moved it up and down my arms and legs. There was plenty to go around and it was super easy to use. My skin felt amazing after just one use. I really did like the fragrance  too. I will be buying a few more of these for myself and also as stocking stuffers for my two daughter-in-laws (a unique gift). Highly recommend!,1
glue capabilities,Dries Clear. I work in a special education classroom and we use glue sticks regularly with our class work. I compared this extra strength glue stick to our regular ones. It's a larger tube than the others  but I really didn't notice any difference in the glue capabilities. It's a good glue stick. It goes on purple and dries clear. It will probably remain my go-to glue stick brand.,1
purchase again,diamond drill organizers. I usually have several projects going at one time.  These boxes are a life saver to me as I can load them - I number the boxes with the color legend and makes it so easy!  They are easy to fill and use with your trays. They stay closed - so far anyway and I've used them over and over. Having said that.. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. At this point  I would purchase these again if I needed more.,1
salt takes a toll,touch and hold smooth dual door closer system. Husband purchased these to replace some others that had given up the ghost.  We live on the oceanfront and the salt takes a toll.  These are nice because you can do it with your foot (when install at the base of the door) just tap it and it stays open  tap again and it releases.  Easy Peasy.  He prefers these and says they are easy to install.  Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6 000 reviews posted  those reviews have been viewed well over 50 000 times  including well over 24 000 likes. Bottom line  I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,0

Douglas and John Smith are still showing up and confusing her even more. After getting another assignment for the magazine with her bff  things really heat up in the magical world. Yes  Aunty June shows up again  with a bit of advice ( warning) for Misty...but oddly enough so do others from her everyday life ! Why are they all here? In this book  big secrets are revealed that will shock you and having you say ""WHAT"" ????. With each book the story becomes more intense. If you like a good read that will get your heart beating with all these surprises  then this one is for you! Morgana Best has done it again!.",1
Great buy!,Great buy!. I have three girls ages 7 11  and 12. They love this  and I would say they use it every day. It seems safe and sturdy  and we’ve had it since Christmas. I would buy again.,1
very pretty design,Had to cut the middle bigger. I am always knocking my Freestyle Libre Sensor off my arm. So I have one of those flower holders for the Libre. These patches to hold the Libre on are very pretty  I love the design. But I had to cut the whole in the middle bigger so it would go over the flower holder to keep the Libre from being knocked off. You only get 5 patches for the cost. That is a lot of money. I read 5 designs  but I did not understand there were only 5 patches for the money. Too expensive for me.,1
convenient,Very easy to load and love buying things from Amazon!. Did this for the free $10 credit but glad I did because it was very easy to do and I plan on doing it again soon! Easy  convenient  and great feature! Happy Prime Member!,1
put the speaker in the shower or take it to the beach without being concerned about it getting wet,This speaker works great!. I love that I can put the speaker in the shower or take it to the beach without being concerned about it getting wet.  Good sound  charges easily.,1
company logo on the back of every piece,Animal Crossing Vibe. This cat island puzzle has an Animal Crossing vibe to it. The image is fun and colorful  plus it has lots of cats! The pieces are a good size and cut well. I didn't notice any puzzle dust. I did not care for the company logo being on the back of every piece. That actually made it a little more difficult to sort because you had to look at both sides to make sure you were putting the right side up. It doesn't come with a poster of the image either. I really appreciate that addition to puzzles. It's a pain to have to hold the box in your hand just so you can see where things go. The full image is on the bottom of the box. The lid has a blown up picture that doesn't show everything. Plus  the brand logo is on both of the images. They really are pushing their logo on us!! They do include a business card size picture of the puzzle but that's really impossible to use because it's so small.,0
sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this,Love the colors in this sponge set sponge texture is light metal holder is great. This is a lovely set of three sponges in nice colors of  pink  burgundy  and teal. It also comes with a great metal sponge holder  a silicone brush cleaner  and some cleaning solution. The sponges are light and airy like most sponges like this on the market.   The burgundy sponge with the flat side is great for smooth applications. The typical egg-shaped (teal) and the hour-glass (pink) sponges are good for blending or any large make-up application. The hour-glass one is easy to hold in the center.  These feel good in the hands  blend reasonably well  and feel soft against my skin. These blenders make a great gift for the make-up obsessed. I love that the sponges do not smell. I tried other colored sponges and they smell like pencil shavings or other chemicals and these do not.  I personally do not use a silicone sponge cleaner. I prefer to use my hands and soap and water but having the silicone cleaner with cleaning solution provided is a nice touch.  The sponges themselves are similar in style to all of the others that I tried before this. To me what set of sponges to buy all comes down to the price and the angles one wants on the sponges as well as whether it is for gifting or not. The colors are important too--at least to me.   The current price of $7.99 is a great deal for this.,1
"""awesome""",Five Stars. awesome,1
using in conjunction with a pressure washer takes off more salt than product,SHIPPING IS HORRIBLE. This is about the 6th time I have &#34reviewed&#34 this product. I received an empty bottled in a destroyed cardboard box that the Post Office but into a plastic bag to deliver to me.  I have since purchased this product locally.  It does remove some of the salt build up (on a metal outbuilding - we live on the ocean front).  Using in conjunction with a pressure washer... which I think actually takes off more salt than product.  Just my opinion.  I would not recommend this seller until they can address their horrible shipping.  Wonder if this review will stick.,0
value size,Light  non-competing fragrance. Great daily moisturizer. Light fragrance that doesn't compete with perfume.  Absorbs quickly. Value size  too!,1
comfortable,Simple headbands that loosely grip my headwish there were more color variety. There are 12 headbands in this set and practically all of them look a similar shade of pastel pink  purple  and yellow. Only one headband is bold with an emerald green. I would have liked a red  black  and brown in this set. However  this appears to be designed for young girls or ballerinas who would love these colors.  I tried these on and the headbands are comfortable and do not squeeze my head. They also stay put. I have a small head so these would probably feed a youngster just fine.  The current price of $15.99 comes to a reasonable $1.33 per headband.,1
characters are pretty rough types,"Wonderful Music & A Gritty  Hard Life Story. One of the best things about this movie is the really good music it has  especially the vocals by a singer I never heard of before this movie.  Her name is Marideth Sisco  a homely  white-haired  rotund lady with the voice of an angel.  Hearing her singing in this movie makes it worth watching for that alone.  Other artists also contributed to the movie and they are all good.  I won't repeat the plot  which other reviewers have covered.  The biggest criticism I have seen is that this is an unfair portrayal of rural country people.  Yes and no.  I am sure there are people who are as scary and nasty as these in the country  but they are few and far between.  Just like anywhere  there are good and bad people in the country  just as in the city.  This is an entertainment movie not a documentary.  The biggest problem I have with the movie is that the actress who plays 17-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) in the movie seems a little too fresh faced and clean for the role.  Given the responsibility she has in the movie  you would expect her to show more signs of fatigue and despair  even at 17.  And some dirt she is always just too clean looking.  She does a good job in the role and perhaps the contrast between her purity and courage and the roughness  cowardliness and cruelty of those around her is one of the main points of the movie.  This is NOT a ""must see"" movie and is a little uncomfortable to watch at times  as some of the characters are pretty rough types.  For example  ""Teardrop""  the brother-in-law of the main character  sniffs cocaine several times during the movie.  Overall I stayed interested in seeing what was going to happen and the ending was somewhat satisfying.  If you don't want to watch the movie  buy the music soundtrack.  4 stars for the movie 5 stars for the soundtrack.",0

LOVE THEM,Superb socks with extra cushioning stays in place while walking are also warm. I first bought a pair of these socks at REI for $27 and loved them. I wanted another color of the same sock so I purchased these. These socks are wonderful. They are slightly thick  sturdy  snug but not too tight  and feel fabulous on. They cushion my heel and bottom of foot and they do not move around like other socks  which helps prevent blisters. I walk a lot and these socks stay put even on a two-hour walk. I LOVE THEM.  One caveat  however. These socks must be an older model of the same sock that I purchased at REI. The reason I say that is because compared to the original sock I purchased  they are about two inches shorter. I then did some research and found a comparison chart for two of the same mountaineering socks by the same name. The only difference between the two models is that there's a slightly different fabric combination and it is not listed as quick drying.  To me both socks feel the same. I also ordered three more pairs. I now own five pairs of these socks and they are WONDERFUL! In fact  I love them so much that I ordered this [[ASIN:B01F47N7XK men's pair]] for my boyfriend. My boyfriend loves them as well. He wears them to bed.,1
stainless swivels,stainless swivels. Too small for what I needed  but it's ok... comes in a great plastic sorted case.  I will put them into my husband's fishing tackle box.  He'll be thrilled.,1
higher quality stuff is more expensive,"Our handles are not round  these work fine.... I think these things would look more form fitting if your handles were round. That may just be my mind playing tricks on me. If our handles were round  I might think these look better on the flat handles. LOL! In any case  they get the job done. But up close  the fabric does not feel premium  it's on the cheap side. But you need to consider what you're spending for 6 pieces. The higher quality stuff is more expensive and does not come with 6 pieces. The term  ""you get what you pay for"" comes to mind. So I'm not going to deduct a star for that. I think this is 5-Stars for the price you're paying.",0

simple and straightforward application,"A good internet security solution. I upgraded to Panda Internet Security 2007  Platinum Edition (I'll just refer to it as ""Panda"" hereafter)  from Trend Micro's PC-Cillin suite after a recurring issue forced me to make a decision. I had had good experiences with Trend and was loathe to change  so changing was not something I really wanted to do. After checking my options and doing some research  I decided to give Panda a chance.  Panda's installation was a bit sluggish but it was not unreasonably slow. It did all of the prerequisite checks before configuration and finally it determined that it was ready to install itself. The installation at this point was smooth and straightforward and when it was done it (understandably) asked me to reboot the system.  Once the system rebooted  I was off to the races. Panda immediately started to look at programs that were trying to access the network  it flagged me down when I had incoming port scan attacks  and it dutifully logged everything going on. It also did something else - it started giving pop-up bulletins. Within 30 minutes I must have received 3 or 4 pop-up bulletins that contained informational messages  not alerts that demanded attention. While these can be configured to not show up  I was just a little annoyed by the frequency under the default settings. These bulletins have decreased since that time.  Panda's first order of business was to eliminate everything it considered to be spyware. This equated to deleting a lot of cookies. Most of these were benevolent  but some were obviously tracking cookies. Panda also seems to be eliminating these types of things when they first reach the system  which in my opinion is a good policy.  The firewall does what you would expect a firewall to to - it keeps unwanted traffic out and it prevents programs from reaching the net without your knowledge or approval. A program can be ""locked down"" and denied all access  and through the firewall profile you can make changes and tweaks to access.  I did some testing with the antivirus  and it worked relatively quickly to scan the entire system. I was able to tell it to work in the background with reduced CPU requirements and as a result the system did not slow down enough to make it unusable. As of yet it has not found a virus on the system so I just don't know how it will react to one when/if it finds one. My assumption is that I will get another pop-up bulletin.  The integrated antispam has yet to prove itself. I use a different antispam product  but Panda still does an evaluation on every inbound message. So far it seems to be properly marking messages as spam or not spam by the footer it places at the bottom of every message  but the other product I use has done the bulk of the work already. I am waiting to see how Panda handles spam messages that slip through the gauntlet and into my inbox. What I have seen thus far suggests that it will probably manage well enough. The antispam does integrate with Outlook automatically and gives a couple of new buttons for classifying spam when it comes.  By default  the parental control feature is turned off  and I decided to turn it on. This is one of the features of Panda I don't especially like. It manages access through the parental controls by way of profiles with passwords. So  when you have an internet connection and you have parental controls turned on  Panda requires a password just to get out the net at all. Granted  this is only required one time for the connection  but it is cumbersome and annoying. This type of set-up is not well-suited for family computing but is better for office and academic environments. After testing it for a little while and determining that it seems to work fairly well  I turned it off to avoid getting chastised by my family. I would likely use this more if there was a way to tell it to filter the same way for everyone without requiring a password.  Panda queries for updates daily. This is reassuring to me  knowing that I am almost always very current and have the latest signature files. I regard this as mostly psychological though  as I doubt I will ever encounter a virus that is new enough to require this tight of an upgrade schedule. The heuristic scan feature of the antivirus is likely to handle anything like that anyway.  One of the more interesting features of Panda is the TruPrevent functionality. Basically  this is a behavioral analysis of applications and processes on the system  which looks for unusual or suspicious activity. So far this has turned up nothing on my system  but it is reassuing to know it's running in the background. This kind of analysis should be used cautiously  though  as there is always a potential for false positives.  Visually  Panda is a very simple and straightforward application with a no-nonsense interface. You are not going to be overwhelmed with buttons and sliders and lists and everything else all jumbled on the screen in one big box  but rather everything is kept as simple as possible. Sometimes this means having to dig a little to find the setting you need  but honestly I think the interface is reasonably self-explanatory.  The most difficulty I had with Panda was in registering the product. I got a pop-up bulletin that offered a discount if I registered then  and I had already made my mind up to do so  so I followed the offer link. I was taken to a page all in Spanish (this is not entirely unexpected as I believe that Panda is based in Spain). I manageed to reach the English equivalent page  entered the requisite information and the website returned a very short error message. I got through several hours later and got through the registration process  only to find that I was sold the wrong product from the link. To resolve the issue I had to call their office and work it out on the phone.  With only a couple of minor annoyances and one registration issue  I have had a very positive experience with Panda. The application is not overly burdensome to my computer  it seems to be very quick and efficient  and it has kept me informed of issues as they arise. I consider this a good solution and I am happy to recommend it.",0
comfortable,"Comfy Dress. This dress is so comfortable that it feels like wearing your favorite t-shirt. It's soft and has a hint of stretch. There are flattering pleats at the waist and it even has pockets. If you're a larger cup size  the top may be slightly sheer. I found the fit to be true to size. I sized down for a more fitted look. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the small.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.",1

color,Nice and soft. This rug is very attractive and is the perfect size for my bedroom.  I love the different color  it makes it blend well with the room.  The reason for 4 stars is the price. It could be a little plusher for the price.  You will love the colors.  I love the way it brings the colors of my bedroom together.,1
gives your lipstick longevity,So Fabulous!. Of course  I love Tréstique  but I especially love this lip primer!  It’s not chalky nor sticky  but provides a great priming for Tréstique lipsticks.  I like the primer so much that I purchased them for all of my Tréstique lippies  as opposed to balm that comes with the glosses.  It gives your lipstick longevity and allows for fullest pigment payoff!,1
Love these,Love these they are amazing. These are fabulous I keep my cats food in one and treats in another both stay very fresh I've had her treats for 3 months and they are still soft they're easy to open easy to shut they are perfect I'm thinking of buying some to store my own food,1
proselytized,Too religious. I wanted to enjoy literary essays  stories  and articles  but it seems like every issue I received this last year is packed full of a religious agenda of one variety or another.  To be sure  the themes seem to be an eclectic variety of spiritual and cultural mysticism  but the magazine never just leaves it out.  It's always a tome espousing some collection of beliefs  cultural systems  and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence using religious narratives  symbols  and sacred histories or allusions from one or another.  Everytime I read it  I feel like I'm being proselytized.,0
looks are richly industrial,A Lot of Mouse. I have never used a gaming mouse before. Actually I've looked down on people who did for the same reason I don't like some players being on steroids in major league sports. But now that I'm getting older  my reactions are slower  my fingers are not as quick on the keys and...Oh...I guess I like it for exactly the same reasons athletes love steroids...  But on a serious note.  Mousing and key gnashing do take a toll. I don't know that this mouse is a complete solution to it. But I have had relief of being able to have some things macroed to a single mouse button.  If nothing else  it has created a different movement.  I like the quality of the mouse.  The tracking is very good  the feel is okay  the looks are richly industrial.  I'm not huge on the extending base to the mouse.  I just wish it had been a little bigger to fit my hand  but it fits fine without extending. Personally  a little heavier would feel a little better as well.  All in all I'm very impressed  and wished I had given into &#34juicing&#34 my game a long time ago.,1
great writing,No spoilers. Four solid stars for a good plot. Great writing and the characters are believable. The summary is pretty spot on. Mia's father was a serial killer who tortured his daughter which drove her to take his life. Vin who is 18 years her senior falls for her after the customary tug and pull. A lot happens in between but that's the general idea. A worthy read.,1

Electronic e-gift cards,Who doesn’t love a gift card?.

clear plastic rectangle on the rear,Tin is reusable by kids who love cupcakes. I recently sent two of these as birthday gifts and the Mom got the loaded gift cards with instructions to let the kids have the tins since I could not bring them edible cupcakes.  From purchases in the past  I was aware that they are pretty thin in depth as well as the metal gauge and I knew that there is a clear plastic rectangle on the rear which provides Amazon to identify the code on the card inside of the tin.  The kids didn't mind that and the Mom didn't mind sharing her gift.  I suspect that the funds embedded in the cards eventually went to buying items for the kids anyway because she's a sharing person.  This is one of my favorite physical gift cards from Amazon which I enjoy sending.,0
shock walls,It does hold the S pen. If the case was just to hold the S pen this case would get 5 stars but in protection for the phone forget that. No shock walls the case is way too flimsy.

health topics,"Creative Recipe Ideas & Fun  Colorful Articles about Life. A real favorite in this magazine is the page of quotes  It is sure to bring a smile or teach you something about life. They also always have cleaning tips  health topics  diet and exercise solutions  true stories  beauty hints  inspirational articles  soul nourishing tips  recipes  recipes and more recipes  family/children  flowers  end of the magazine article to make you think about life  and gardening hints.  If you want to find a cover story fast  they have an ""on our cover"" section in the index. In Every Issue there is a shopper's guide and a recipe index.  The articles are helpful and in the March 2002 issue they had an article on how to be less stressed. They also had an article on PCOS which is apparently more common than we women think.  The beauty sections show you the newest fashion and you can decide if you want to adapt your style to the trends. Always seems rather chic.  Some of the recipes in the March 2002 issue included:  A luscious Lemon Coconut Pound Cake Coconut Macaroons Peanut Butter Oat Bars Baby Cheesecakes - really cute Banana Salsa French Oven Beef Stew Pasta with Shrimp  The recipes are not difficult and seem practical.  Even the advertising in this magazine is colorful and fun.  A Very ""American Gal"" type magazine. Nothing fancy  just real life.  ~The Rebecca Review",1

side handles help to move it about,collapsible toy chest. The toy chest is exactly as represented and their measurements are accurate.  Holds a LOT of toys.

rugged and well made,A lovely leather tote!. This tote by Pascado is nice. It is rugged and well made. There are shoulder straps (two sizes). The leather is an orangey-brown  which will match most outfits. The inside of the bag is lined. There are two front pockets (magnetic closures) and a rear zippered one. There are also two side pockets which are useful if you want to slip an umbrella inside. The size of the tote is decent and can hold a variety of items (essentials and a small electronic). *The electronics I would consider are a small iPad mini or Kindle. Either would fit fine. The front or side pockets can hold a small cell phone or keys. I have a OnePlus cell phone that fits fine. And finally  I love that this company always encloses a nice “thank you letter ” which is a great touch! I’d recommend this tote.,1
looks good,FEELS NICE LOOKS GOOD. This has a nice feel to it and it makes a really nice mat under my keyboard and mouse.  Mouse glides easily on it  but I might not use it for the mouse  as I have a mouse pad with a wrist rest on it and that helps a lot when I am using the mouse heavily.,1

soft ones for my son to be able to fit them in the case,Good protectors.. They're nice but too big for the standard size carrying cases that you can find everywhere.

Amazon wrapping this up nicely and shipping it overnight,Pretty Enough Box and Bow for Any Occasion. It's a $25 gift card. I bought it to take advantage of an Alexa/Echo offer. The box and bow are attractive but they were in the garbage in five minutes and a few minutes after that the credit balance was in my account. Sending the pretty box and bow was nice and only other option was a white gift box with bow. Why I couldn't have been emailed the $25 code I don't know but I actually feel a little guilty for Amazon wrapping this up nicely and shipping it overnight. I'd have been happy with a code to copy  paste and redeem. Now all Amazon had to do  as promised  is email my $5 voucher for buying this $25 card.,1

comfy,Comfy but lacks a sturdy bottom. My dog rode to and from Pagosa Springs Colorado (we live in Phoenix) and loved it. We set it on a suitcase belted in underneath so she could look out but she loves it. She rides in it now around town but can't see out of the window. She's an 18lb maletese shitzu,1
tassels,Great Set!. A few weeks ago  my children and I started crafting with resin. One of our friends saw our initial pieces and requested an initial. Well  we needed a new mold then! This is a great mold that has all of the letters A-Z and digits 0-9. The molds aren't too shallow so the finished letters are a good thickness. The set also comes with some fun accessories such as the tassels and key rings. There's also some glitter and a tool for putting the holes in to the finished letters. I ended up ordering some different key rings  because I wanted clips so we could clip our initials to our bags if we wanted. Overall  this is a fun set to have.,1
tenure,"The Best (No Further Title Required). As a poet  there are a few places I'd love to be published. There's the New Yorker  the Atlantic  and Poetry Magazine. There are other places I want to see my work  but these three are  to me  huge. They vet the best poems  and publish them.  Only Poetry focuses on poetry. A review of their history would tell you they have tenure. Great poets are published here. Ones we all know  and ones we all should know. Unlike the New Yorker and the Atlantic  Poetry is especially open to unknowns. If you are good enough  you are in  whether you are famous or not.  Like most literary magazines  the design is clean  almost simple. Here  considering everything from paper color to typography  poems are more than printed: they are framed. No  no  no fancy design. Rather  they clear the way so that the poems are highlighted. Nothing but.  An essay and a few reviews finish each issue  followed by a couple pages of ads. All black and white.  If you are looking to buy a true literary magazine  as much curated as it is edited  pick this one. Don't do it to ""support the arts "" but because each issue is worth the time and money.  I fully recommend Poetry.  Anthony Trendl americanspeechwriter.com",1

scent,Nice Exfoliation. My daughter is a huge fan of I Dew Care products. I ordered this for her  but I gave it a try first as I am a huge fan of body scrubs! This scrub has a waxy-like consistency. I found it best to rub it between my hands for a moment before applying it to my body. In doing so  it lathers a little bit and changes the consistency to something that won't glob onto your body. There is a good amount of grit to it  but it's not rough or scratchy. It actually does a nice job of exfoliating. I was hoping for a delicious coconut smell  but it's not. I can't pinpoint the actual scent  but it's very nice and pleasant. The scrub rinses well. Because of the waxy base of the scrub  it doesn't leave your skin feeling dry or stripped. There's no waxy build up either. I think my daughter will enjoy it. I was especially pleased with how it worked on my hands and elbows.,1
No 2 Coffee filters 100 ct works well with collapsible single cup coffee maker,"Perfectly fine product  does the job with care. Every ""If You Care"" product I have used has been a good product. I am particularly keen on their parchment paper for baking. Unbleached  chlorine free  and better for the environment. As for this product  this is my second package of No 2 Coffee filters  100 ct. I don't go through them too often  but I use this size when I am brewing a cup of coffee using a collapsible single cup coffee maker (typically used for hotel stays and camping  but occasionally in house too). I think typical coffee makers use No 4. Grounds never seep through it  and my coffee always tastes great. I have no use for the typical white paper filters  and so I am happy to be able to buy this product here as well as in stores. I have zero complaints or concerns  so a full five star rating is warranted.",1
action series used to be better than this,it is a okay book  but not great. I truly think author try to explain things that matter  the only problem is  it doesn't explain it well or to the point.

doesn’t look great,Less sweat  dried feet. I am on the fence about this product.  It states to apply 3 times a day at first.  Who has time for that?  I did apply at least twice a day.  For the first few days  it did nothing.  After repeated use  it started to help decrease the sweating of my feed.  It does state this in the directions.  It dries the feet out  which I guess is the point  but aesthetically speaking  it doesn’t look great.  I want nice looking feet   not over dried looking.  The bottle is pretty small .  It lasted about a month.  I did buy another bottle  so I could really decide whether I liked it or not.  I am still deciding whether to buy another or not.  Don’t like how my feet look when using it  but I like having less sweaty feet.  I am wondering how it would work if just used during exercise  when the sweating is worse.,0

I had another ocarina but it wasn't a 12 hole it was a 6 hole I believe and I had trouble getting nice sounds from it it felt a lot different from this one!

Canadian cast and crew does a consistently amazing job of bringing Blood Ties to life,"Vicki Nelson's new partner really sucks...literally.. Blood Ties revolves around Victoria ""Vicki"" Nelson  an ex-cop with Toronto's Metro police. Vicki was forced to resign due to a degenerative eye disease  retinitis pigmentosa  and is trying to make a living as a private investigator. Her fiery romance with fellow cop Mike Celluci is an on-again  off-again affair  and her first case as a PI gives her more than she bargained for: someone is summoning demonic forces  and Henry Fitzroy  her new partner on the case  just happens to be a 480-year-old vampire and is the illegitimate son of Henry VIII.  The series pilot Blood Price is faithfully based on Tanya Huff's [[ASIN:0756405017 Blood Price (BLOOD SERIES)]]. The remainder of the season finds Vicki exploring demons  incubi  reanimated corpses  shapeshifters  mummies  voodoo  ghosts...while caught in a crackling love triangle between former flame Mike and sensual  deadly Henry. Vicki's new assistant is the perky Goth Coreen  who also has her eye on Henry.  Blood Ties consistently satisfies my cravings for an intelligently handled supernatural cop drama. Its premise sounds promising in print  but without Blood Ties' cleverly crafted story arcs and meaningful character interaction  it would amount to little more than a tired monster-movie-of-the-week retread. This is a show that wisely knows not to take itself too seriously  leading to fast and furious one-liners  visual gags and impeccable comedic timing. The entire Canadian cast and crew does a consistently amazing job of bringing Blood Ties to life  and it's great to see a Canadian production receive airtime in the States.  The show's setting is Toronto but is filmed in Vancouver (with exterior shots of identifying Toronto landmarks)  but it's still Canadian through-and-through  a rarity in days where tired Toronto is expected to double as Everyamericancity. This may be the first show since [[ASIN:B0000C23T1 Forever Knight - The Trilogy  Part 1 (1992 - 1993)]] that revels in its Canadianness.  Although Blood Ties is currently off-air  its fan base continues to spread through word of mouth  Big Fish's Blood Ties game  and Internet groups  thereby bringing new viewers into the fold. It has been at least a decade since I felt so strongly about a TV show I was so moved by Blood Ties' strong female role model and intriguing blend of romance  police procedural  and the supernatural that I downloaded several episodes via iTunes and recruited several friends to the show.  Blood Ties remains my current favorite for its enchanting blend of humor  passion  action  moral dilemmas  and the mortal (and immortal) ties that bind. Tanya Huff's source material has been toned down enough to allow families to enjoy Blood Ties together. Blood Ties protagonist Vicki Nelson (Christina Cox) is a strong positive role model for women through her physicality  self-reliance despite disability  and intelligence.  It's instantly obvious (except to American/Canadian networks who are reluctant to pick up the show for a second season  grrr...) why Blood Ties continues to be nominated for numerous awards such as Constellation and Leo Awards. The entire cast  headed by Christina Cox (Vicki)  Kyle Schmid (Henry)  Dylan Neal (Mike)  and Gina Holden (Coreen)  has an outstanding chemistry that shines on-screen  and I can't wait to finally own Blood Ties on DVD!",1
excellent recording,Pink Floyd.....ahhh. We have the old sound track of Dark Side of the Moon.  My husband know music and is in fact a composer in his own right.  He listened to this trice so far and put his stamp of approval on it.  It always was an excellent recording but this new one is wonderful  you can hear things you do not hear on the original.,1
fan is absolutely useless,Easy to assemble  Bike rides smooth  display and fan not so good.. It is a little difficult to slide the seat into place but I think it's only because it's new. The display panel is too small and it's difficult to see it due to no back lighting. The fan is absolutely useless. Even when I lean into the fan  it doesn't blow my hair at all.  It's too high on the display and too weak.  The plug for the display is in the front of the bike  making it a trip hazard unless you want to face the wall while working out.  I had to tape mine to the bottom of the bike.  They should have passed the wire through the frame of the bike so that it could plug into the back.  The bike itself rides smoothly and is very quiet.  It would be nice to have the bells and whistles actually work correctly.,0
maneuvers easily,Great styling brush!. This is a great brush. Quality made  strong bristles  it works perfectly on my shoulder length hair. I typically like to straighten my hair so I spend quite a while brushing and blow drying my hair every morning. This brush is a perfect size for me  fits well in my hand and maneuvers easily. Just perfect. I ordered another for my guest bathroom for when people visit. Highly recommend!,1
fast paced and easy to read,Captivating Beaty and the beast nod. The suspense and passion of this book makes it fast paced and easy to read. Each character has depth and development from the author which makes you look toward the ending. Once the ending arroyos then long for the next book. I highly recommend to HEA enthusiasts!,1

traditional Gold Toe socks,Well made  traditional Gold Toes socks  great colors. The men in my life (husband and sons) love Gold Toe socks and I love them women's styles  too. These Stanton socks are great  perfect length for them to wear especially under both dress and casual pants. We love the color of these  and they look great with jeans (great blue colors). Quality made and with the well-known Gold Toe pattern. We highly recommend these socks for all of the men in your life!,1

majestic whales,"A moving modern-day NZ fable.. Niki Caro's ""Whale Rider"" (based on the novel by Witi Ihimaera) is an uplifting tale of tradition and inner strength. Twelve-year-old Pai (talented newcomer Keisha Castle-Hughes) lives with her grandparents in a rural New Zealand town. Pai's mother and twin brother died in childbirth  and her artist father took off for Europe  where he now has a new (pregnant) girlfriend. Pai's brother was supposed to be the next chief of her tribe  and with his death Pai's grandfather Koro searches for a new (male) leader  failing to see that it is Pai that possesses the courage and talents of a chieftain. The movie is filled with a haunting soundtrack by Dead Can Dance's Lisa Gerrard  including samples of traditional Maori music by Hirini Melbourne. The cinematography beautifully captures the many moods of light and shadow on mountains and sea  as well as stock footage of majestic whales. ""Whale Rider"" is an uplifting tale of love  loss  and courage  about tradition in the face of change  and believing in yourself.",1
hardback,50 States and where to go book. Santa brought this to me this year  because we travel for work to a lot of different places all over the world and the US.  I am looking forward to using it as a fun reference for wherever we are headed.  Lots of full color pictures and easy to read paragraphs on ideas of what and where to go.  Hardback.,1
compresses,This is very supportive. I do find it is a little snug  but it's supports very well.  I can't say if the copper does anything extra or not  but it is definitely snug and compresses.,1
thin,Perfect!. Both of my college kids have been wanting to paint this summer. These canvas boards are perfect! They're pretty thin so they don't take up a lot of storage space. My daughter likes to sketch her drawing first with pencil so these are easy to grasp and hold while doing that. There are 14 canvases  so there's enough for them to share!,1
compact and easy to hold,Great Alternative to Clarisonic. If you want a good facial cleansing brush  but don't want to spend $200  this is a good alternative. The brush is compact and easy to hold. It doesn't take up much space on a counter. It also packs well for travel. It's cordless and rechargeable. It's a good skincare tool. Don't forget to clean your brush with antibacterial soap after each use.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review. I hope the information that I've provided makes your decision a little easier.,1
postal system didn't screw them up,Very Nice!. I love these! I also Appreciated the additional notes written on the envelope so the postal system didn't screw them up. Thanks for the added care!,1

hung awkwardly on the shoulders,Does not look like Display Pictures. My dress arrived and it looks nothing like the display picture.  The arms had a thin piece of feathery material on them and hung awkwardly on the shoulders.  The dress was not shaped as shown either.,0
seller was great,Finally got it. I've been wanting this song in 'hard copy' for awhile so when I saw this CD/DVD combo (and it was my birthday)  I snapped it up. The seller was great. The product came in good shape and in good time all the way from Japan so I'm really happy. I was a little worried about region but I was able to play it with the Power DVD with no issues. The song is one of my favorites from Exile the Second as is the music video so it is nice to have the hard copy for my library.,1
sound is good,He said they are comfortable and the sound is good. My son loves these.  He said they are comfortable and the sound is good.,1
Elvis fan,She loved Elvis's movies growing up  she still loves the original soundtrack albums. Purchased as a Christmas gift some years ago for my younger sister  our extended family's biggest Elvis fan.  She loved the Elvis musicals growing up (especially It Happened at the World's Fair  Viva Las Vegas  Roustabout  and Girl Happy)  and tuned them in anytime they were being shown on television.  She had collected most of the soundtrack LPs (or 8-tracks  or cassettes) but hadn't gone the CD replacement route  except for her favorites in the Double Feature series.  So  here we are  Elvis for Christmas one more time.  Needless to say  she was / is thrilled with the boxset  absolutely loves it keeps it on prominent display on a special Elvis shelf in her music room.  And she regularly keeps the discs in heavy rotation.  The full five-star rating and highly recommended for the true Elvis fanatics in your life.,1
you should be able to buy a cover for it,Nice that you have many size options but You have to have a covering made for it.. Don’t know how I missed it...but this comes without any covering at all. The material holding the stuffing together you would not want to sleep on. If Amazon is going to sell these you should be able to buy a cover for it.,1
motorized part,5-7 year old set.... We've only received one month's worth so far but will update after this month's set comes. We purchased the 5-7 year old set for our 6 year old's bday. She needed help with it when we first put things together  played with it a while...then decided she wanted to try another one. I helped her put that one together and we talked about how to follow the directions one step at a time  etc  she played with it for a little while. Then  she took it apart on her own  and started building her own creation! She first played with the motorized part and figured out how to position the wheels and legs how she wanted them  and now  she's teaching the 2 year old how to do it! &#603 I love creative toys that teach tinkering and whatnot! I can't wait to get the next set in a few days!,1
older and will expire at the end of the year,This planner is an older version  be aware that it is for 2019. This is a nice planner  but it is older and will expire at the end of the year.  It is not a good value even if it was for this year and next.  It's basically a notebook with a calendar pages.  I would value it at no more than $12.,0
crafts are not the greatest quality,No directions. The box is super cute and I while the crafts are not the greatest quality  they look cute. The problem is  they don’t come with directions!!! I messaged them and no response so this is a complete bust unfortunately.,0
useful in the bathroom,Great scent  very useful in the bathroom.. I generally recycle plastic grocery bags for when trash needs to be thrown out immediately (ie: cleaning out the fridge  changing the cat litter  etc). But these bags are perfect for lining my bathroom garbages  as they are in there for a week or so and help with odor. In fact  the fragrance on these is nice and light  very fresh  and it adds a nice  subtle touch to the bathroom. I also appreciate the flaps that have managed to keep the bag in place  while also making it more convenient to tie up and take out when it's time.,1
provide her with the chewing she craves along with quality natural ingredients,Great dog chews that my Roxie just loves!. My typically picky eater  4 year old Aussie Shepherd mix  loves these jerky dog treats. And I love giving them to her! I really like Milo's Kitchen products which always seem to produce a quality dog product that my Roxie loves. These simply chicken jerk provide her with the chewing she craves along with quality natural ingredients. Kudo's Milo's for another great  product!,1
teaching a country unit,Nice Kenyan Flag Bracelet. I wish I could get a variety of flags for bracelets.  I'm teaching a country unit.  This Kenyan bracelet of it's flag was a big hit!,1
"""retractable""","Nice pencil. Im not sure what they mean by "" retracktable"" because once the lead point comes out you cant make it go back in. There are a nice variety of colors in the box. I like how each pencil has 3 more leads stored inside itself. The gripper feels good in my hand and is easy to write with. As with any pencil like this  you cant press down too hard as you write because the lead will break.",0
built in vacuum,Just like getting a spa pedicure at home!. I have extremely rough and dry heels and feet. I tend to get pedicures every 2-3 weeks and it seems like within a day or two of having one done  my feet are back to being rough. I wanted to try one of these home pedicure callous removers and this one is exceptional! I love how it makes my feet feel and look  and it is actually really neat that the built in vacuum helps keep my bathroom clean while using it. Highly recommend if you are in the market for a home pedicure tool!,1
dont bother wasting your money,Not Happy. this product lasted 3 months and died  i had to buy a new computer  this part was hard to find - contacted seller he/she never responded - dont bother wasting your money  buy a new computer !!,0
biographies,"Putumayo Presents: Greece - A Musical Odyssey. Putumayo's Greece-A Musical Odyssey was released in 2004 to coincide with the Athens Olympics  and features an ear-opening blend of traditional Greek styles such as rembetika (known as Greek ""blues"" and usually about misfortunes) and entehno from artists such as George Dalaras  Glykeria  Apenanti  Melina Kana  Anastasia Moutsatsou  Kostas Mantzios  and Theodosia Stiga.  The magical bouzouki (a steel-stringed long-necked lute) is featured on every track  along with the santouri (a type of dulcimer). There are Balkan flourishes and even a hint of flamenco on Ragizi Apopse. Many of the songs are melancholy-sounding ballads balanced out by more intense songs such as Pino Pino.  Putumayo has included excellent liner notes as usual  with detailed biographies (with an artist pronunciation guide!)  photos  a Greek music glossary  and even a recipe for Tzatziki  Greek cucumber-yogurt sauce.  I had not been exposed to Greek music before watching My Big Fat Greek Wedding and picking up Greece: A Musical Odyssey  but I fell in love with rembetica and the bittersweet songs  and have since expanded my Greek music collection. If you enjoy spirited folk music (or if you really liked the music from [[ASIN:B00006AAUC My Big Fat Greek Wedding]])  you'd do well to buy Greece: A Musical Odyssey.",1
over priced,Poor quality and over priced. Over priced and sealed weirdly so I wouldn’t even use this for fish because they could ingest the sealant because it is put in with so much. It came in a Walmart box and they cost $15 at Walmart,0
bargain basement travel set,PU case really smells brushes are okay two brush heads frayed. There are 14 brushes in this set. There are brushes for foundation  blush  eyeshadow  eye blending (fan brush)  etc. In fact  there are more brushes than I needed.   The one unique brush in this set (see photo) is the one that looks like a paint brush. This is perfect for cheek highlighting.  The bristles are relatively soft but not as soft as I expected. They feel pretty good against my skin but not great. Also  the heads have a slight odor. The PU brush case has a tremendous chemical odor and needs to be aired out a while.  This is a bargain basement travel set for someone who is starting their make-up journey. The current price of $11.19 comes to $.80 cents per brush. In this case one gets what they pay for it's a marginal price for a marginal quality set that is functional. ,0
"princess did not ""need"" a prince to be happy",paper bag princess. First read this to my daughter years and years ago when she was about 8....  Had an occasion to bring a book to girl baby shower where they asked for your favorite kid book.  I have always loved that the princess in this story did not &#34need&#34 a prince to be happy.  A good lesson and a great story for all little girls.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful  nor do I shy away from answering comments/questions.

soft stretchy velvet,"Also Works as a Top. I absolutely love this dress  but it's too short for me to wear by itself. I decided to try it with some leggings and I love it this way  too. The fabric is a soft stretchy velvet. There are faux feathers around the wrists. There's figure-flattering ruching at the waist. I found the fit to be true to size. For fit reference  I'm 5'6""  153lbs and a 34G bra size. I'm wearing the medium.  Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

feels great in the hand,"Awesome Disc. I beat my old distance record on the very first throw with this disc. It feels great in the hand. It's pretty stable right now  but I'm hoping it develops a bit more turn as it breaks in. I was mostly throwing hyzers  and it kept a straight line very well. My last throw of the night had a bit of an anhyzer release  and it WENT. It ended up next to a building that I thought was way out of my range. I was saying ""holy balls"" over and over again  and a park ranger felt the need to ask if I was OK. Great disc.",1
sturdy or durable,Okay. These are the larger of the bags offered. I like them  but no paper bag can be sturdy or durable. I do miss them having the cutout-notch at top to open the bag.,0

plusher,Nice and soft. This rug is very attractive and is the perfect size for my bedroom.  I love the different color  it makes it blend well with the room.  The reason for 4 stars is the price. It could be a little plusher for the price.  You will love the colors.  I love the way it brings the colors of my bedroom together.,0
sturdy,Good idea  not at all sturdy. This is not sturdy. Falls apart way too easily. A light blanket is not even able to be held up with it. Any little bump breaks it apart. Such a great idea  but needs to be much stronger to function.,0

bakeware,Make showstopping desserts on your countertop with minimal effort!. I’m a fairly recent convert to the slow cooker bandwagon I only purchased my first slow cooker a couple of years ago and started out by baking my way through all the desserts in Michele Scicolone’s excellent “The Mediterranean Slow Cooker ” which introduced me to the joys of making flan  cheesecake  and fruit compote in the slow cooker.  Fast forward several years later and I was looking to expand my slow cooker desserts repertoire  so imagine my delight when I got an e-mail from Lisa Ekus that highlighted “Slow Cooker Desserts” by Roxanne Wyss and Kathy Moore! Roxanne and Kathy are cookbook authors  food consultants  cooking teachers and food bloggers who have written seven cookbooks and a popular blog  www.pluggedintocooking.com.  As soon as my copy of “Slow Cooker Desserts” arrived  I couldn’t wait to dig in to the many inviting recipes covering not only cakes and cheesecakes  but also bread puddings  fruits  and candy and fondues. The book opens with a good compact guide to slow cookers  bakeware  and ingredients. The layout is uncluttered and straightforward  and each recipe is followed by helpful tips  making it perfect for novice bakers. The gorgeous photography by Jennifer Davick deserves a special mention as well.  The first recipe I tried was the Praline-Pumpkin Cheesecake. I decided to substitute a gingersnap crust for the graham crackers  and it added the perfect touch of spice to complement the spices in the cheesecake filling. Note that you do need to blind bake the gingersnap crust prior to baking in the slow cooker  but this only adds a few minutes to the prep time. Also  perhaps it was the brand of gingersnaps I used  but I would recommend adding a little extra melted butter until the crust comes together – the recipe calls for 1 tablespoon melted butter for ½ cup crumbs. One thing I would suggest is to also liberally spray the sides of your springform pan as well – mine is supposedly nonstick  but I followed the recipe (which only specifies to spray the bottom of the pan) and a large portion of my cheesecake edges stuck and broke. I normally do spray the entire pan with Baker’s Joy  but I follow the recipes as written when I am testing for reviews.  The finished cheesecake texture is very fluffy and a bit crumbly  so I did have difficulty cutting it neatly I’m not sure if I may have beat TOO much air into my filling and will beat for less next time. The praline topping (made in the microwave in under three minutes) is destined to become my new secret weapon in the kitchen! This homemade caramel was delicious and deceptively easy and would also make a great addition to ice cream or cakes. All combined (gingersnap crust  spiced pumpkin filling  praline topping)  this is a great fall dessert with minimal effort and also frees up your oven for other baking tasks.  The second recipe I tried was the candied cranberry and crystallized ginger chutney this one called my name because I am a certified fiend when it comes to candied ginger. I had a bag of organic cranberries in the freezer that I was looking to use up  so it worked out perfectly that I already had all the ingredients on hand in my pantry (even the ginger liqueur!). My bag of organic cranberries was slightly smaller than the 16-oz. bag called for in the recipe  so I scaled back on the sugar quite a bit as I was using candied ginger (I used ¾ cup sugar in place of the 1 ¼ in the recipe  and it was plenty sweet for me). It also had the bonus of making my kitchen smell amazing as it cooked! I cooked mine down for a little longer the recipe says that it should be thin  but I like my chutney on the very thick side more like a compote. The recipe calls for between 5 to 7 hours on low and I ended up cooking mine for 3 hours on high due to time. This would be fantastic stirred into yogurt  as an accompaniment to Indian food  or even as a side dish in place of jellied cranberries or cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving.  The third recipe was the chocolate cashew clusters. I’d seen slow cooker candy (including nut clusters) pop up in my Facebook feed  but I’d never tried making it before. The recipe uses salted cashews  semisweet and milk chocolate chips  a dark chocolate candy bar  and candy coating to create decadent nut clusters that look like they came from a candy shop. These take about 1 ½ hours on low plus cooling / set time (3 to 5 hours).  Other recipes on my to-make list from “Slow Cooker Desserts” include the cinnamon-calvados applesauce  rice pudding with cherries  and many of the cheesecakes (brownie chunk  German chocolate  ginger-peach  coconut cream) and cakes (cider-glazed apple-walnut cake  Southern sweet potato cake  pineapple butter cake). There is enough variety and possible variations (I need to find a way to make a cookie butter cheesecake!) to keep you happily baking for months to come.  (Thank you to Lisa Ekus for the review copy!),0
lovely sturdy storage box,really arty. Once in a blue moon I write and snail mail to someone.  These cards are very interesting and &#34arty&#34...  I live on the ocean front and I thought these were a great pick.  I was a little nervous as they were a bit expensive  but having them in my hand  I like them.  They came in a lovely  sturdy storage box too.,1

small can of hairspray,hard shell travel case for hair tools. Got this to &#34house&#34 a small roller type stick and flat iron.. a couple of rat tail combs and a small can of hairspray for my Mom's short hair.  It fits nicely under her sink and is easy to grab. It fits the standard length instruments perfectly. It's lined with a soft  fuzzy material - an elastic band on side keeps your tools in place and the other side has a handy mesh flap perfect for combs  etc. I great zipper keeps everything where it needs to be and then... a super handy handle.  I am very  very happy with this purchase as it fit my needs so well.  I will  of course  update my review should new info seem useful.,1
feather spine shafts,Nice range in colors  but flimsy shafts.. The package was nicely divided and orderly  and the array of colors/textures (flavors) is very delightful  says my cat. However  as I was affixing clasps to the feather spine shafts to make toys for my cat  they keep breaking with very little pressure applied by myself.  While I realize these are craft feathers  the stems should not be so fragile and hollow that they have very little support to last for whatever project they are being used for (you can crush them between two fingers very easily). That's the ONLY reason why I subtracted stars.,0
words are mirrored,Not bad. I think the masks work for kids. Covers their mouth and nose. It fit my six year old and two year old. As another reviewer mentioned  the words are mirrored so that is a little weird.,0
phenomenal value,"Superb Chess Database and Preparation Software. I am a longtime user of Chess Assistant  having used it since version 6.0. Chess Assistant is at its heart a database program but it is a lot more than just a database manager with a lot of chess games stored in databases - it also is a tournament preparation partner  a playing partner and top-drawer analysis tool. Compared to other commercial chess database applications available  it is a phenomenal value.  There are three editions of Chess Assistant available. The base level package is the Starter package and it is a great place to start when working with this type of application. The Professional package is similar but has additional content and has a more powerful commercial chess-playing ""engine"" included. The Mega package is the top-of-the-line offering and has even more content included. I will focus on the Professional package.  Chess Assistant includes several databases of games. The most notable is the HugeBase which includes over 5 million games. There is a Guru database which includes games from the top chess players in the world. There is also a Correspondence database that includes games between notable correspondence players. All of these databases are searchable via a number of criteria  such as player name  opening system used  date  result and more. Using the search functions  it is very easy to isolate any desired categories of games  such as all games played by a specific player in a range of dates where said player used a specific opening system.  Not all of the databases are collections of games. One database in particular is the Openings database and it is used to study opening systems. This is a powerful and complete database for really getting into the meat of any opening. It ties in with the other databases as well so following a specific line in an opening can show the percentage of wins to losses using any given line.  Where this database system really shows its power is in the functions geared towards preparation for opponents. With a single menu item selection all of the games by a specific player can be pulled from a database with a breakdown of openings used and the success rate of those openings against the player being researched. Professional players will find this to be invaluable - in short order this functionality can quickly expose an opponent's soft spots.  Chess Assistant does a lot more than manage databases of chess games. It includes several chess playing engines that can be used for sparring. And  because of built-in support for WinBoard and UCI protocols  adding other engines is easy to so that almost all of the available chess engines for download on the Internet can be linked in and used for playing  either against a human opponent or against each other.  Engines that are linked in can be used for analyzing games as well.  Once a game is in one of the databases  there are functions for performing game analysis that provide a quick and complete automatic analysis of said game with minimal interaction from the user. Analysis can be based on the amount of time the engine is allowed to use or the depth to which the engine should search (depth being in ""ply""  or half-moves). Analyzed games are automatically annotated by the engine and additional annotations can be made by the user.  The Professional package includes Houdini 3 Pro  currently the strongest chess playing engine available in the world. (The Starter package includes Houdini 3  not Houdini 3 Pro). Houdini is powerful enough that it will cruch all opponents (including the world champion) with ease so it is not the best choice for a sparring partner unless you want to expose weaknesses in your game with clinical precision. Where Houdini shows its value is actually in game analysis  where it can find even the most subtle advantages and explain where errors occurred that other engines cannot see.  Another nice feature included in Chess Assistant is an interface to the Internet Chess Club (ICC)  where one can watch games  play and interact with other players. There is limited guest access  so be aware than not all functions are available to non-subscribers.  Chess Assistant's user interface has remained relatively unchanged over the several years I have been using it and its the one criticism I have of the application. Though many functions are grouped appropriately  there are a few cases where finding a specific setting requires a but of hunting through menu selections and dialog boxes. Also  I dislike some of the default settings as well  one example being that engines are given only a small amount of memory for hash tables which limits their strength. These are nitpicks and can be worked around but are worth mention.  Chess Assistant is a powerful and fairly complete chess application  combining database functionality with the ability to link in chess playing/analysis engines. It is the one chess application I use consistently and in my opinion is worth every penny. If you need a chess database application  Chess Assistant is probably the best value available.",1
jagged cliffs plunging into the St. Laurent on the other,"A must-have CD for an outstanding price. I first read about Daniel Taylor on the SchollSociety messageboards and Amazon.com and I was intrigued. A Canadian countertenor with a voice comparable to Andreas Scholl's? ...I couldn't resist. I took it along on a three-hour bus ride to Tadoussac  Québec.  As the mournful opening strains of Erbarme Dich commenced  the haunting  sweeping violins and viol carried me along the winding roads through the mountains. The sky was overcast  and as I heard Taylor's voice for the first time the sun came out. I was in Heaven beautiful vistas of mountains on one side  jagged cliffs plunging into the St. Laurent on the other and Daniel Taylor's voice in my ears. Erbarme Dich is deep  passionate  and so achingly beautiful. I am an avid lover of Bach but it was the first time I had heard anything from St. Matthew's Passion. I was more familiar with many of the other Dowland songs: Time Stands Still  Come Again  Flow My Tears  and I Saw My Lady Weep  all of which are present on Andreas Scholl's ""English Folksongs and Lute Songs.""  Daniel Taylor's voice is exquisite. Haunting. Ethereal. A creamy  lush  pure sound  more feminine than Scholl's tone  reminiscent of brilliant Japanese countertenor Yoshikazu Mera. As with Scholl  the effect sounds effortless and angelic. ""Daniel Taylor: Portrait"" is an excellent introduction to an amazing talent. Ten stars.",1

closet full of clothes from Calvin Klein,Good Calvin Klein fragrance  long-lasting and pleasantly (although strong) scented. This is a fairly strong scented fragrance for woman. I liked it  but had to apply it sparingly so it didn't overwhelm my coworkers. I typically love Calvin Klein products (I have a closet full of clothes from them)  but the verdict is still out as to whether I will be making Obsessed my new go-to fragrance. I did get compliments from my husband  so he really did like it. Long lasting as well so a little goes a long way. Go to your local Macy's (or pick your favorite department store) to sample this before purchasing to be sure it is right for you.,1

active all night long,Great solar powered lights at a reasonable price!. For the money these lights are fantastic. I live in a fairly dimly lit community and although crime is minimal I prefer to have some sense of security at night. Being solar powered  I was able to set these up easily myself (without have to call in an electrician). These work great and I have them spaced strategically around the perimeter of my home. They are bright  but not blinding  and the solar battery charge keeps them active all night long. I highly recommend these as an added security feature for your home (at a minimal cost).,1

I received an empty bottled in a destroyed cardboard box that the Post Office but into a plastic bag to deliver to me.  I have since purchased this product locally.  It does remove some of the salt build up (on a metal outbuilding - we live on the ocean front).  Using in conjunction with a pressure washer... which I think actually takes off more salt than product.  Just my opinion.  I would not recommend this seller until they can address their horrible shipping.  Wonder if this review will stick.,0
last,Reusable christmas boxes. These are flatter reusable christmas boxes with magnetic flaps.  They are sturdy and pretty.  We reuse them for years - these look like they will last - but time will tell!  We use wired ribbon and reuse it too.   Having said all of this  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest  personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so  to give you a little more info about me  I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - nearly 6 000 reviews posted  viewed over 50 000 times  and over 24 000 likes. I pay for all my stuff  just like you do.,1
provides a very stable support,Transforms lightweight X stands into mixer stands (or other uses). I purchased this to support a [[ASIN:B001Q5S99M Peavey XR8300 8 Channel 600 watt Powered Mixer]]  which weighs in at 45 pounds. I also purchased an [[ASIN:B0007WPCKE On Stage Classic Single-X Keyboard Stand]] as the base. That lightweight stand easily accommodates the mixer weight  and also provides a very stable support.  This has enough surface real estate to place a large mixer or even a mixer and other devices such as wireless receivers. I like the way this adjusts to the support arms on my keyboard stand to provide a non-slipping surface that is easy to center to that it does not tip.  Since there are detailed product specs I am not going to repeat the dimensions. I will say that if you measure out the length and width you will see that you can support a lot of gear on the top surface. My base keyboard stand supports 90 pounds  and I am pretty sure this top will support even more if I were to switch to a double-braced base and add even heavier gear.  The only thing you DO need to consider is height of whichever base you choose  because the center of gravity becomes a critical factor as you go higher. For example  the stand that I am using as a base will extent to 38 inches high  but then the bottom is only eleven inches apart. That is unstable for supporting a 45 pound load. I am mentioning this because you need to consider these factors when determining what kind of base you plan to use this this top.,1
farmers,A delightful tour of the many gastronomic pleasures Quebec has to offer.... Julian Armstrong has written about food for the Montreal Gazette for more than five decades. As soon as I heard about this book  I knew it was the one for me I studied abroad for two summers in a French immersion program at Universite Laval in Quebec City and majored in French with an emphasis on Quebec Studies  so La Belle Province has a huge place in my heart. Quebec is a huge land area with great diversity in its landscape and people some regions are famous for certain products (the nickname “bleuets ” blueberries  is given to people from the Lac-St-Jean area as they grow large amounts of the fruit). Quebec also produces many excellent raw milk cheeses (which are under strict control in other provinces) and maple syrup. Its culinary heritage is strongly influenced by hearty French cuisine preferred by trappers and fur traders. “Made in Quebec” is the author’s second cookbook focusing on the cuisine of Quebec here she spent several years interviewing cheese makers  mushroom foragers  chefs and farmers  salt cod fishermen  fruit scientists and growers. The book is divided by season and include both staples (poutine  tourti&egravere  tarte au sucre  pate chinois) and modern interpretations of traditional flavours. I loved the simple  delicious vegetarian options like the gorgeous Tarte aux tomates confites au sirop d’&eacuterable et cru du clocher (Tomato Tarts with Maple Syrup) on the cover in addition to many lamb and pork dishes  there are many fish- and veggie-based dishes to enjoy. The desserts in particular are spectacular.,1
representation of the type of music,Wonderful representation. This album is a great representation of the type of music that she has sung so well over the years.  It also includes a booklet with pictures and a biography of this wonderful singer/actress.,1
playing cards in bike wheel spokes,Cool. I put these on my van rims and I was taken back to my childhood..remember putting playing cards in you bike wheel spokes and hearing them clack and see them spin as they turned? Thats what they remind me of except for the clacking lol. Nice touch to dull wheels.,1
less expensive than my other printer,Canon MP480 all in one. I owned Lexmark Pinter about 4 of them and 3 HP. I like this one the best  even it was less expensive than my other printer. Reason: I never had a printer in which the Ink lasted 3X as long as Lexmark  the other printer nickel and dimes you to dead over the ink to expensive and does not last.  Cannon ist excellent,1
table doilies,Pretty colors available. Nice thin placemats of good size. Can be used also as table doilies.,1
sound is sharp,Smooth Unparalled Pop of the 40's. Some nostalgic albums reissues from the 30's  40's and 50's just don't age that well and just don't sound as well as you might remember them if you were alive in that era.  This is a wonderful exception and its sounds as fresh as it did when these songs were first popular.  Lots of artists have done Chattanooga Shoe Shine Boy  but I never cared for most of the versions this one by Red Foley is the best version I've ever heard.  I came across this album by accident  as you don't often hear Foley's name.  Strange since he had the first million seller gospel album and sold over 25 million records in his heydey and influenced many other artists.  I am sure I must have heard Foley in the 50's without knowing his name.  At that time  this was not called country or country western music.  It was cowboy music or it was just the music we listened to on the radio we didn't really classify it.  This is a nice variety of songs all the way from the sad (Old Shep) to the humorous (Don't Be Ashamed of Your Age).  There are a few really nice duets too.  The sound is sharp and Red's voice is smooth and pleasant.  If there is anything disappointing about this album it's that it doesn't go on a lot longer still with 16 songs  one can't complain too much.,1
challah recipes,A wonderful resource for home bakers. Hot Bread Kitchen  based in NYC  builds lasting economic security for low-income  immigrant and minority individuals by creating pathways to professional opportunities in the culinary industry. 67% of their operating budget is funded through the sale of multi-ethnic breads and rental of commercial kitchen space. The range of breads that they bake and deliver includes Iran (nan-e-barbari  a chewy flatbread topped with black and white sesame seeds  and nan-e-qandi)  Morocco (m'smen  a flaky flatbread traditionally served for breakfast with honey)  Mexico (corn tortillas)  Eastern Europe (challah)  Ethiopia (the slightly sour injera  fermented teff flour served with wat)  and more.​   The long-awaited Hot Bread Kitchen Cookbook is divided by bread type: unleavened and flatbreads  lean breads and rolls  enriched breads  rolls  and buns  filled doughs  and quick breads and holiday breads. You'll find favorites from India (paratha  naan  chapatis)  the Middle East (hummus  pita)  Eastern Europe (challah  matzo  eier kichel  bialys  knishes  kreplach  nut roll)  France / Italy (batard  pan bagnat  olive boules  ciabatta) and Mexico / Latin America (pan de muertos  conchas  tortillas  guacamole  tamales  tostadas  empanadas). Other little-known gems include Albanian cheese triangles  Tibetan momos  Another thing I liked was that various recipes are included that use leftover bread  from bread puddings and stale bread (panzanella  tres leches bread pudding with Mexican chocolate sauce  ribollita)  to complementary dishes (curry  wat  stews  dips  salads) that pair perfectly with the included bread recipes.  I consider myself a fairly competent home baker I have long worked with yeast breads (including fresh cake yeast) both kneading by hand and stand mixer  and I welcomed the challenge of new bread types. Step-by-step photos (for trickier items like braiding challah) are particularly helpful for novice bakers. As a longtime baker of challah  I particularly appreciated the many challah recipes  including basic  raisin  whole wheat and Sephardic. You'll even find Vietnamese-style bagueettes and iced Vietnamese coffee.   This lovely selection of breads and accompanying dishes  sauces  and sides is rounded out by baker profiles and a very thorough guide to tips  equipment  and bread storage suggestions. Ingredients are given in US volume and metric (for my baking books  I generally prefer weight measurements  so appreciated having the metric weights given). Gorgeous photos give serving suggestions for each bread and side dish featured in the book. A list of online/mail-order sources and a hefty list of acknowledgments round out the book.  An excellent resource for home bakers  especially if you already have some prior bread baking experience. This is a fantastic treasure trove if you enjoy trying international bread recipes and new dishes it would be fun to host themed dinners using the included recipes. Highly recommended!

fast moving card game,fast and fun. So  I've been playing this game since I was about 10... It is a fairly fast moving card game and can be played with 2 or more.  I was disappointed to see that in this version they removed the French!  So  the card have only the English words.... Not a BIG deal  but I was disappointed as we had fun shouting out the French.  It's a draw and discard type game... you are racing to collect &#34miles&#34 and be the first to reach a certain goal.  Another thing that was missing in this version was clear scoring information  like &#34safe trips&#34 (not using 200 mile stones) but I remember enough to apply.  If I were doing this again  I search out the French/English version.,1
average/typical size,will work. I ordered 2 of these and it would have been so nice if they'd sent two different colors... but no. Two of the same.  I have a mouth guard AND invisalines for top and bottom.  So I ordered the two.  I don't really care what they look like... I two I got were a muddled white and teal mostly.  They will work.  They are an average/typical size.  Good for storage only  not for cleaning with water and the tablets you can buy.  Just in case you thought you'd might try that.,1
